"Mobile Peer Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine Learning Tool PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal develops a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure, technology-based peer support platform to support patients with opioid use disorders (OUDs). The majority of individuals with OUDs in the United States do not receive any formal substance use treatment, and growing evidence suggests that many OUD patients turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related information about addiction and recovery. While engagement with peers before and during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery programs, commonly-used online social platforms (e.g. Reddit) lack effective content moderation, with inappropriate messages ranging from misinformed advice to maliciousness. This lack of oversight precludes a deeper integration of peer support and clinical care. Our mobile platform allows patients to access a tailored support group 24/7, and is augmented with AI tools capable of understanding the emotional sentiment in messages, automatically `flagging' critical or clinically relevant content, creating a scalable system to keep groups safe and constructive. This phase I proposal demonstrates the robustness of these AI tools by adapting them to catch OUD-specific `flags' in peer messages while also examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients. A subsequent phase II proposal will test tailored, real-time interventions to `flags', allowing the commercialization of a system to harness the engagement and self-disclosure of peer groups in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE The widespread and chronic nature of opioid use disorder (OUD) necessitates investment in highly scalable technology solutions. Our work has the potential to dramatically broaden access to care for patients, particularly those in highly stigmatized and rural communities, while taking an entirely novel approach to patient triaging and tracking through artificial intelligence technology. Such technology has the potential to enable new modalities of treatment and lays the foundation for a more cost-effective, yet personalized, approach to chronic OUD care.",Mobile Peer Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine Learning Tool,9679778,R41DA047837,"['Adopted', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethics', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Self Disclosure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stigmatization', 'Support Groups', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'addiction', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health intervention', 'clinical care', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'peer', 'peer support', 'personalized approach', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'social', 'social stigma', 'standard care', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDA,"BEACON TECH, INC.",R41,2019,225000,0.04532556064434313
"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,9776678,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2019,493633,0.07183191023013677
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9727956,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'classification trees', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,588500,0.1887747474866128
"Online Evidence of Withdrawal Self-Medication PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Withdrawal symptoms from opioid use can be severe and are major contributing factors to relapse and continuing misuse. Many opioid users are actively experimenting with “remedies” that can alleviate withdrawal, and they are discussing their effectiveness in blogs and forums. In this pilot study we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and human expertise to examine over 50,000 recent posts in two Reddit forums OpiatesRecovery and Opiates to assess systematically which remedies are being used, how they are being used, and what are the reported consequences of such self-help experimentation. We will create a curated database of user-reported “remedies.” Information will be semiautomatically extracted from the online, self-reported use of alternative treatments (i.e., other prescription drugs, over the counter medications, food supplements, activities such as meditation and yoga). A team of a pharmacologist, physician, and ethnographer will evaluate database entries to uncover (1) potential harm associated with uncontrolled and unsupervised experimentation, (2) potentially effective available treatments (e.g., traditional medicine), (3) potentially promising compound leads, and (4) patients' needs and issues that are most important to them. Aim 1. To assemble an extensive database of opioid withdrawal and remedy-associated terminology from posts on OpiatesRecovery and Opiates Reddit communities. NLP will be used to build a language model that understands how words are used in context (word2vec). Aim 2. To develop a dataset of instances of self-reported remedy use from Reddit and conduct a bipartite network analysis of remedies and users. Using NLP tools and the word embedding model we will develop an exclusive dataset containing extracted information associated with remedies targeting withdrawal and craving. This aim will use elements of artificial intelligence and close human supervision to extract remedies, including variations of spelling, from the texts. The result of this aim will be a remedy database that includes spelling variations and slang references and a network analysis linking remedies and users. Aim 3. To organize, aggregate, and systematically assess information from mentions of remedy use. Potential compounds and other remedies will be classified to provide an initial assessment of their potential relevance to the opioid treatment process. This process will require the most human oversight and assessment. Network analysis tools will be used to assess and identify the relationships between the types of remedies and potential therapeutic effect and will create the benchmarks for similar future studies.

"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention.

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team’s expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship. Project Narrative This application will establish the Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network. The creation of this node will help facilitate research on substance and opioid misuse which are key components of NIH and federal government strategy to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with the current opioid and substance epidemics.

"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. Narrative The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real- time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, through a 280-patient trial, we will examine clinical outcomes of the system using a waitlist randomized control study. We want to demonstrate that when compared to standard- of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. The project leverages a 100-patient population in our 11 partner facilities (assisted living and skill nursing), recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots.

"Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Project Abstract The opioid epidemic is the U.S.'s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: America's Startups and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user- centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a “stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic. ! Project Narrative With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health problem. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprises of a healthcare team portal connected to a patient mobile application, to provide opioid related education, promote connectedness with clinicians, and track MAT treatment progress. This STTR Fast Track proposal will conduct interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS and utilize a “stepped wedge” effectiveness design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes in primary care settings and evaluate sustainability and return on investment.",Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care,9912034,R42DA050398,"['Abstinence', 'Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'HIV', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'North America', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Suboxone', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'care providers', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'medical specialties', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mobile application', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient population', 'phase 2 testing', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'scale up', 'social stigma', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'user centered design', 'waiver']",NIDA,"Q2I, LLC",R42,2019,225000,0.16423389742321692

"Remote vital sign and opioid overdose detection via a non-invasive wearable sensing patch PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Approximately 2 million Americans are living with an opioid use disorder, and in 2017, 17,029 people overdosed on prescription opioids. Opioids cause respiratory depression; however, fatal overdose usually occurs over a period of 1–3 hours, leaving a window of opportunity to intervene with the inexpensive drug naloxone, an opioid antagonist, that can reverse the effects of opioids, quickly restoring normal respiration rates. VivaLNK proposes to enhance the currently marketed Vital Scout wellness wearable sensing patch for use in people at risk for opioid overdose, by detecting physiologic indicators of an opioid overdose (slow respiration rate, low heart rate and low blood pressure), and the ability to send a potentially life-saving overdose alert, which could be received by an emergency contact/caregiver and hasten treatment with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone. Health monitoring emergency notification systems that can remotely monitor patient vital signs for indications of deterioration and send a potentially life-saving alert to emergency contacts/caregivers, have the potential to greatly reduce the number of fatal opioid overdoses in the US. The Vital Scout patch is already strategically positioned to monitor overdose parameters utilizing the built in ECG sensor to continuously register waveforms from which respiration rate, heart rate, heart rate variability, and activity are calculated. While several devices are currently being developed for overdose alerts, the Vital Scout is the only alert which has the potential to capture the three critical vital signs indicative of an overdose, and simultaneously monitor physical activity, providing additional context to the vital signs data. The vital signs collected by the Vital Scout patch are based on a machine-learning algorithm which we propose to further develop by the following specific aims: 1) Refinement and optimization of the Vital Scout to incorporate an overdose algorithm with an alert function by improving the sensitivity in order to detect lower respiration and heart rate indicative of a potential overdose. 2) Expand the sensing capabilities of the Vital Scout system to include blood pressure monitoring. The algorithm will be optimized using three volunteer cohorts (~20/ cohort) (i) healthy volunteers, (ii) elderly patients over the age of 65 (more likely to have low BP due to medically-induced hypotension) and (iii) low BP patients (represented by elite student-athletes). Data from these cohorts will provide the initial broad range of data for the machine-learning linear regression algorithm. We will assess whether these are appropriate designations for providing accurate blood pressure measurements, similar to what is seen within the opioid population. Meeting all of these goals will result in an enhanced Vital Scout that will be the most sensitive device for opioid overdose detection to remotely monitor the vital signs of people addicted to opioids and those at-risk for opioid overdose, including but not limited to, people with pulmonary disease or those taking antidepressants.

"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder.

"Development of a tracheal sound sensor for early detection of hypoventilation due to opioid overdose. Abstract More than 64,000 Americans died from drug overdose in 2016 and drug overdose is now the most common cause of death for people under 50 years old in the United States. Furthermore, the number of overdose deaths is increasing with the rise of abuse of powerful synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. In May of 2017 National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) directors Drs. Collins and Volkow outlined how research may help reduce the death toll associated with the current opioid epidemic; one of the current critical needs is the development of new overdose-reversal interventions, including wearable technologies that can detect an (impending) overdose from physiological signals to signal for help, or trigger a coupled automated injection of naloxone. Automated detection of overdose is essential because most opioid overdoses occur when individuals are alone and unobserved by family members or first responders. Opioids cause respiration to slow and become irregular due to mu-opioid receptor mediated suppression of respiratory related regions of the brainstem and spinal cord. Importantly, there are characteristic early changes in breathing pattern that indicate a progression towards significant hypoventilation, but there is currently no easy-to –use method or device to measure these patterns non-invasively. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in respiratory monitoring using tracheal sounds. Tracheal sounds originate from the vibrations of the tracheal wall and surrounding soft tissues caused by gas pressure fluctuations in the trachea. These sounds can be collected from a microphone placed over the trachea and analyzed to determine the real-time respiratory rate and an estimate of respiratory flow and tidal volume. We hypothesize that individual trends in tracheal sounds detected by a machine- learning algorithm will provide an early warning sign of the onset of hypoventilation as a result of opioid overdose in humans. The aims of this proposal are to develop a machine learning algorithm that detects impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose and to develop an initial design for a miniature wireless tracheal sound sensor. Project Narrative RTM Vital Signs, LLC is developing a non-invasive Tracheal Sound Sensor for early detection of impending hypoventilation due to an opioid overdose. The sensor will continuously monitor an individual’s respiratory pattern to detect a significant change from baseline, in which case it will contact a caregiver and/or emergency personnel detailing the location and status of the person experiencing an opioid overdose or initiate a coupled naloxone injection. This technology has the potential to prevent a significant number of deaths as a result of opioid overdose by allowing for the timely detection of hypoventilation and administration of naloxone.",Development of a tracheal sound sensor for early detection of hypoventilation due to opioid overdose.,9680488,R41DA047779,"['Abdomen', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Body Patterning', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Engineering', 'Environmental air flow', 'Family member', 'Fentanyl', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Hypercapnic respiratory failure', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Noise', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Snoring', 'Sorbus', 'Spinal Cord', 'Study Subject', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Thick', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Trachea', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'alertness', 'base', 'body position', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microphone', 'mu opioid receptors', 'notch protein', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smartphone Application', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'synthetic opioid', 'time use', 'trend', 'vibration', 'volunteer', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,"RTM VITAL SIGNS, LLC",R41,2019,236381,0.11163147634397273
"iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY The integrated research and training plans outlined in this K23 submission will prepare me for a career as a clinician-scientist conducting translational substance abuse research. My career goal is to perform hypothesis- driven original research investigations directed toward reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose. In this proposal, I intend to deploy wearable biosensors (small devices that continuously record physiology) to study the effects of therapeutic administration of opioid analgesics. I have already studied wearable biosensors in individuals receiving opioids; my preliminary data demonstrates that opioid-tolerant individuals have different biometric signals than non-tolerant individuals. This observation suggests that biosensors can be used to identify the onset of tolerance, an important event that correlates with higher doses of opioid analgesics, and higher risk of death from opioid overdose. Biosensor data management and analysis requires signal processing, data analytic, and machine learning techniques; these approaches are beyond the areas of traditional medical training. My short-term goal is to utilize this K23 award to fill my knowledge gaps in wearable biosensing and advanced data analysis so that I can generate ever more innovative responses to the problem of opioid prescribing, tolerance, misuse, addiction, and overdose. To optimize this important line of investigation, I have developed a training plan that includes: 1) completing a PhD through the Millennium PhD program; 2) expanding my skills in wearable biosensing and behavioral health-based research; 3) developing an understanding of signal processing and machine learning; 4) developing data analytic and data science skills; and 5) expanding my research presentation and dissemination skills. I will achieve these goals through directed coursework, focused seminars, and practical experience. My mentorship team of expert investigators who will ensure my productivity and success includes E. Boyer (primary mentor), D. Smelson, J. Fang, and P. Indic (secondary mentors), and D. Ganesan (advisor) My research plan has three specific aims: 1) to deploy a wearable biosensor technology to detect digital biomarkers associated with the initiation of opioid analgesic therapy in an opioid naïve population; 2) to use signal-processing analytics to identify transitions in digital biomarkers with progressive opioid use and to identify individual characteristics associated with this transition; and, 3) to apply and explore supervised learning algorithms that can predict transitions in digital biomarkers that herald the onset of opioid tolerance. To identify dynamic patterns in response to opioids, I will study the digital biomarkers of opioid-naïve patients with acute fractures who are prescribed opioid analgesics. Results will be used to develop “big data” approaches to apply predictive algorithms to identify the onset of opioid tolerance. This work has the potential to prevent development of problematic opioid use and will provide the basis for subsequent R01 submissions to implement sensor-based interventions triggered by the onset of tolerance in individuals receiving opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to opioids (both prescription and illicit) has reached staggering proportions: more than half of individuals who currently abuse heroin report that opioid abuse began with a prescription opioid. Dr. Carreiro has demonstrated that wearable biosensors can discriminate between individuals who are naïve to the effects of opioids from those who are opioid tolerant, a characteristic that increases risk for opioid-related death. This career development award will provide her with the training to use of wearable biosensors to identify the onset of opioid tolerance and the expertise to reach her ultimate goal of developing tools to prevent opioid-related death and increase the safety of opioid prescribing.",iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals,9666315,K23DA045242,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug abuse', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heroin Abuse', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'career', 'comparative', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'digital', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2019,188575,0.16622871077756884
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,9724645,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2019,190538,0.06885549320890899
"High-throughput profiling of compound abuse liabilities and identification of addiction-related drug targets using an iPSC-enabled platform Project Summary/Abstract The scale of the US opioid addiction crisis clearly evidences the critical need for breakthroughs to assess compound abuse liabilities and to enable discovery of new analgesics with minimal abuse potential. We hypothesize that altered addiction-associated physiology can be modeled in co-cultured hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells and detected by profiling gene expression alterations and associated phenotypic readouts. Our proposal addresses the significant lack of physiologically-relevant tools capable of profiling relevant molecular changes that underpin addiction in the human nervous system by executing Specific Aims that encompass: (1) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; (2) execution of a phenotype-based pilot machine learning-enabled predictive abuse liability screen; and (3) combination of phenotypic profiling and gene expression analysis to characterize the molecular and cellular changes associated with compound exposure. Successful completion of our project will deliver 2 significant advances: (1) an important new technical framework to assess abuse potential of candidate therapeutics early in the development process and (2) an innovative, scalable in vitro assay platform that enables discovery of targets and associated candidate therapeutics to mitigate addiction phenotypes. These innovations will position Cairn Biosciences to initiate drug discovery programs that will bring significant societal benefit by helping to stem the growth of the US opioid crisis and reduce the mortality rates and economic burden associated with this National Emergency. Project Narrative The ongoing opioid addiction crisis clearly evidences the need for new approaches to overcome addiction and mitigate the abuse liabilities of new therapies, yet a critical barrier to progress is the lack of in vitro assays in human cells to profile the abuse liabilities of therapeutics. Our project will deliver an innovative in vitro assay platform that enables 1) the assessment of abuse liability of candidate therapeutics early in development and 2) the discovery of targets and associated candidate therapeutics to prevent development of an addiction phenotype. These high impact advances align with government priorities such as the NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) initiative and will deliver significant additional benefit to public health by enabling identification of safer new therapeutics without addictive potential.",High-throughput profiling of compound abuse liabilities and identification of addiction-related drug targets using an iPSC-enabled platform,9912598,R44DA048686,"['Address', 'Analgesics', 'Astrocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emergency Situation', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Glutamates', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Array', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transfection', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'addiction', 'base', 'design', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'drug discovery', 'expression vector', 'healing', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein expression', 'stem', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic candidate', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIDA,"CAIRN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,323750,0.040789137145427486
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9756462,U01MH110925,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'biobehavior', 'clinical decision support', 'design', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular marker', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'tool', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2019,5432897,0.028325747468173
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9416993,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,537201,0.15859456239966774
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9785384,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2019,158220,0.05051158436118139
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,9835697,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,735192,0.10587706311493332
"Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic PROJECT SUMMARY Up-to-date information about non-fatal overdose emergency department (ED) encounters can provide critical information about the evolution of the opioid epidemic and response of the healthcare system and is an essential to planning of clinical trials to address the problems underlying this epidemic. Establishing a platform that delivers high positive predictive value for opioid-related overdose (OD) using a combination of coded and natural language terms in electronic health records (EHRs) is an essential step toward the large-scale surveillance necessary to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of numerous systemic and policy-based efforts and to create the infrastructure for large scale trials to reduce drug-related mortality and morbidity. However, to date, localized and federal efforts have been largely based on discrete ICD-10 code data or have had time lags of one-to-three years for more detailed data. Perhaps more Importantly, they have not had the capacity for planning and feasibility assessment for clinical and translational research at specific sites. We propose foundational work to create an inter-institutional research database and network focused on patients presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD. To create this network, we will extend previous work to develop: (1) an e-phenotype for case identification in the ED based on EHR data, and (2) combine this with a data dictionary and coded data extraction tools, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, to obtain additional data from EHRs; tools for primary capture of data during clinical care; and tools for integration of data on social determinants of health. This will allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD including: demographics, comorbidities, OD agent and source, intentionality of the OD, ED treatment and discharge disposition. Through refinement and automation, the data extraction process will be extended to a set of pilot CTSA Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network sites and then potentially to other CTSA's nation-wide. This new functionality focuses on providing a platform to accelerate research. To accomplish this work, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ACT Network data model and infrastructure to monitor the opioid epidemic using ED data, 2) Create a prototype opioid overdose monitoring and response network across participating institutions and a toolkit for other CTSA sites to join the network, and 3) Demonstrate potential usefulness of the network in monitoring the opioid epidemic and in planning clinical trials. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective near real time means of monitoring opioid-related OD presentation in EDs across the country to inform point-of-care service delivery, prevention and treatment intervention development and evaluation. Downstream, the application of project deliverables include dissemination of the replication toolkit to leverage the platform of the CTSAs and NIDA Clinical Trials Network to build capacity for timely surveillance of opioid-related OD to facilitate prevention and treatment research and intervention.

"Real-time fMRI neurofeedback of large-scale network dynamics in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY The misuse of opioids, opioid addiction and overdose are a serious national public health crisis—the opioid epidemic—that despite increased scientific, clinical and government attention, continues to grow. Methadone is a generally effective treatment for opioid use disorder, however relapse rates remain high, and risk of overdose is greatest during relapse. There is a need for improved mechanistic understanding of the factors that contribute to opioid relapse to improve our understanding of opioid use disorder and its treatment. Using connectome-based methods (i.e., functional connectivity) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we recently identified a large-scale brain network that predicted opioid relapse from both resting and task states. Connectome-based methods enable data-driven characterization of whole brain networks related to behavior that might be better suited to describe complex clinical phenomena (e.g., opioid relapse). Building on prior work indicating the utility of real-time fMRI neurofeedback to test brain activation patterns related to specific functions and individual abilities to regulate these functions, the proposed project will use connectome-based neurofeedback to target patterns of functional connectivity within our recently identified “opioid abstinence network”. This information is critical to improve understanding of mechanisms of opioid relapse. Individuals on methadone will be randomized to receive either active (n=12) or sham (n=12) connectome-based neurofeedback at 3 weekly scanning sessions including feedback and transfer runs. Additional baseline and follow-up scans will include resting state and reward and cognitive task runs. Craving, negative affect and opioid use will be measured weekly and at 1-mo follow-up. Based on our pilot data, connectome-based feedback will be targeted at the opioid abstinence network and we hypothesize that increased connectivity in this network will be associated with improved clinical outcomes. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with reduced opioid use from baseline to follow-up scans (Aim 1a) and at 1-mo follow- up (Aim 1b). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with increased opioid abstinence network connectivity in resting state (Aim 2a) and task (reward, cognitive) state (Aim 2b) versus sham feedback, as in our pilot work. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with greater improvements in clinical features of opioid use disorder (craving, negative affect) than sham feedback (Aim 3a) and that increased opioid abstinence network connectivity will correlate with these improvements (Aim 3b). Overall, this project tests a potentially transformative hypothesis relating large-scale brain network dynamics to outcomes in opioid use disorder, and tests a highly innovative method for real-time fMRI neurofeedback from the opioid abstinence network to improve clinical features of opioid use disorder. This project will provide unprecedented insight into the functional neurobiology of opioid relapse and more generally has the potential to transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project leverages advances in real-time fMRI neurofeedback and machine learning to test whether methadone-treated individuals with opioid use disorder can increase functional connectivity within an empirically-derived “opioid abstinence network” that has previously been identified to predict opioid relapse. This project will provide critical data and information to improve our understanding of opioid relapse and may transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions more generally. Findings should contribute to the scientific and clinical response to the growing opioid epidemic and be used to inform treatment development.",Real-time fMRI neurofeedback of large-scale network dynamics in opioid use disorder,9841187,R21DA049583,"['Abstinence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Government', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'connectome', 'craving', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methadone treatment', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose risk', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,251250,0.1622724755683075
"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",9817054,R01DA046620,"['Academic Detailing', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'American', 'Area', 'Buprenorphine', 'Censuses', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Community Trial', 'Intervention Trial', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methadone', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neighborhoods', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research Priority', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid policy', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'peer', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'referral services', 'resource guides', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment arm']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,718669,0.11576768430895913

"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9883361,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'empowered', 'first responder', 'health goals', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,135653,0.12008959521475139

"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids.

"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9547370,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Drug Screening', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Prescription opioid overdose', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid abuse', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,585626,0.1887747474866128
"Project FIGARO - Factors Important to Gather for Anticipating Relapses for Opioids PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) the propensity for relapse is high when experiencing craving, independent of a desire to stay sober. Historically, tools to fight opioid addiction have been limited and retrospective. By the time a traditional intervention occurs, they are often already reusing. Addiction relapses too often lead to a costly downward spiral - committing crimes, getting rearrested, being hospitalized, overdosing, and/or dying. Recent advances in wearable sensors, smartphones and artificial intelligence have created an unprecedented opportunity to produce positive health outcomes by predicting and preventing OUD relapses and overdoses. With sensing and associated algorithms, it will be possible to detect relapse risk states and intervene in advance - before a relapse actually occurs. The first step in this new era of proactive opioid relapse prediction is to identify and measure digital biomarkers associated with reinitiating drug use and relapse and implement a predictive model with minimal false positive alerts to achieve just-in-time intervention. This will begin with the collection of quantitative and qualitative data on patients and healthcare professionals to identify desired features and functions. Behaivior LLC will develop a relapse prevention platform that will consider a combination of physiological sensor data from the patient’s wearable devices in combination with smartphone usage data, location data and – importantly – reports from people in his/her support network to identify and detect relapse triggers in real-time. SA-1​: Demonstrate what makes a wrist wearable device acceptable and usable for people with OUD. SA-2.A​: Identify positive correlations between physiological, location and smartphone data, and self-reported opioid cravings: ​Results will be used to create a predictive model that can operate in real-time. SA-2.B​: Demonstrate feasibility of using support-network-reported data to predict opioid cravings. SA-3​: Create a predictive model to anticipate opioid relapse as a step towards just-in-time intervention. SA-4​: Demonstrate feasibility of predictive model by obtaining a sufficiently low false positive rate. A successful outcome of this project will be a wearables platform capable of predicting and preventing opioid addiction relapses, stemming the tide of the opioid epidemic. The platform will be ready for regulatory approvals and integration into existing electronic health records and monitoring systems. To achieve behavior modification, Behaivior will implement and commercialize a wearables platform and suite of effective interventions utilizing individualized, active machine learning, and continued iteration of next generation wearables and supporting mobile applications. ​A​ robust platform prototype capable of producing measurable change will be tested. Further development of the most promising MVP(s) will be pursued by a Phase II SBIR proposal. Project Narrative Knowing in real­time when someone with opioid use disorder is at a high risk of relapsing will revolutionize the ability to intervene at the right moment to help people stay clean and sober. Our research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about the specific information needed to be gathered in order to accurately detect when someone struggling with opioid use disorder is in a high­risk opioid craving/obsession state, and will enable the creation of a predictive model for just­in­time intervention. The number of deaths from opioid overdose is increasing every day, so reducing opioid addiction relapses will save lives and families and it will reduce rearrests, reincarcerations, and rehospitalizations.",Project FIGARO - Factors Important to Gather for Anticipating Relapses for Opioids,9545451,R43DA046149,"['Aftercare', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crime', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dropout', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'General Population', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Heart Rate', 'Heroin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'Obsession', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prescription drug overdose', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'base', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drinking', 'drug craving', 'drug relapse', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fighting', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mobile application', 'next generation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rearrest', 'recidivism', 'reincarceration', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'sobriety', 'stem', 'support network', 'tool', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"BEHAIVIOR, LLC",R43,2018,223791,0.12691862252690939
"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid agonist therapy is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder, including prescription opioid use disorder. However, important questions about safety and risks during treatment remain unanswered.

"A wearable device to detect opioid overdose and to prevent death Bioresp Technologies, Inc. proposes development of RespiLife, a new wearable device to to track physiologic data for early detection of opioid overdose and to relay data and the generated alerts to relevant caregivers for further intervention. The goal is to reduce the number opioids-related deaths by early detection of overdose. Opioid epidemic death toll has quadrupled since 1999. About half of those deaths are due to prescription opioids and for the most part are unintentional. RespiLife tracks oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and pulse rate and based on a machine learning algorithm will determine changes from the baseline and correlation of those changes with changes in medications. Our specific aims are: (1) Production of five working prototypes with their algorithm to use in our validation study. (2) A validation study to compare our data with a gold-standard device and carry out statistical analysis for evaluation of agreement and accuracy.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study.

"Biosignatures of opioid addiction treatment success The United States has experienced a four-fold increase in medical opioid use over the last two  decades. Medical opioid abuse and addiction have increased and afflict 5% and 2% of US adults  respectively; heroin addiction afflicts 0.5% of US adults. In 2016, >39,000 US individuals died of  a medical opioid, illicit opiate or synthetic opioid overdose, an increase of 18% from 2015. While  opioid addiction treatment admissions and treatment capacity have increased many-fold over the last  two decades, patient needs greatly exceed capacity. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) approaches for opioid use disorder include three approved  pharmacotherapies combined with psychosocial and supportive therapies. Active investigations are  evaluating established and novel therapies for opioid detoxification prior to MAT. MATs have  established but limited efficacy in treating opioid use disorders compared to placebo  pharmacotherapy. Patients treated with MATs have mortality rates during and after treatment that  exceed population mortality rates. Improving efficacy through personalized treatment is essential  to optimize MAT resources and reduce mortality. “Biosignatures of opioid addiction treatment success” offers a data science solution that aligns  with NIDA priorities and Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidance to expand use of MAT, and with HHS  priorities to support cutting edge research on pain and addiction. Our overall aim is to decode the  predictors of MAT success and enable health care providers to improve treatment efficacy using  accurate forecasting. In Aim 1, we will create a platform for applying learning algorithms to existing and future opioid  addiction treatment data. We will organize and merge clinical, treatment, and outcome variables  from clinical trials of opioid addiction treatment publicly available through the NIDA Data Share  resource. We will import these data into a database optimized for high dimensional data analysis.  Workflows will be developed to apply multiple Bayesian learning algorithms to the data. In Aim 2,  using the biosignature learning platform, we will identify sets of variables that together predict  opioid addiction treatment success. We will apply this platform to each trial independently, and  then to multiple trials in an integrative analysis. The learned biosignatures will be ranked by how  well they predict treatment success. The best models will be incorporated into a proof-of-concept calculator. The calculator will provide treatment success scores based on the  characteristics of new patients. We will present the prototype to multiple stakeholders for  assessment. At the end of Phase I, we will have created a biosignature learning platform and a proof-of-concept  opioid addiction treatment success calculator. We plan to fully develop these components with  additional datasets and variables in Phase II. Our commercial goal is to develop licensable and  easily deployable algorithms for healthcare networks treating opioid addiction. The algorithm will  help providers understand profiles of patients likely to be successful with MAT and to personalize  treatment strategies to maximize abstinence. In this project, we are using algorithms to learn the predictors of opioid addiction treatment  success from publicly available clinical trial data. Healthcare providers can use these models to  improve their opioid addiction treatment programs.",Biosignatures of opioid addiction treatment success,9559228,R43DA046325,"['Abstinence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Buprenorphine', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonidine', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Fentanyl', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Heroin', 'Heroin Dependence', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methadone', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid agonist', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Published Comment', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Supportive care', 'Tramadol', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'addiction', 'base', 'biosignature', 'clinical translation', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'heroin use', 'high dimensionality', 'illicit opioid', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'lofexidine', 'medication compliance', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose risk', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'success', 'treatment program', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,BIOREALM,R43,2018,224152,0.13487740454670283
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9559625,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2018,156568,0.05051158436118139
"Development of a secure, cloud-based platform to improve record linkage & cross-agency collaboration for the public sector: using deep learning & scalable data integrations to combat the opioid crisis Project Summary/Abstract: This SBIR Phase I proposal aims to fund research and development for a new, multitenant secure cloud-based platform specifically tailored to provide local governmental agencies with tools to share datasets and link them accurately, at high quality and low cost. The OpenLattice platform will focus on reducing drug overdoses and making drug treatment less fractured. Individual-level datasets linked across medical providers and law enforcement can support analyses of prescribing pathways and treatment trajectories that precede opioid overdose, entry into treatment, disruption, and recovery. However, linking data at the individual level has proven to be a difficult and resource-intensive endeavor compared to use of aggregate-level data, with issues with deduplication plaguing many institutional databases. With 91 American deaths recorded daily from opioid overdoses and systems of care spread across multiple institutions, the need for greater and high-quality data sharing is undeniable. Our test partner for assessing the efficacy of proposed innovations is the Greater Portland Addiction Collaborative (GPAC) in Maine, a partnership of hospitals, a police department, jail, detox treatment centers and halfway houses already working together to reduce drug overdoses. This proposal aims to demonstrate proof of concept for (i) scaling high-quality data integrations across multiple governmental domains via a standardized entity data model, and (ii) improving record linkage using neural networks. Firstly, OpenLattice is developing an open source ontology and integration scripts to standardize integration of datasets into OpenLattice's database. As the individual customization requirements decline for onboarding customers and integrating new data into the platform, costs will be greatly slashed, removing a significant barrier to data solutions for smaller counties and cities across the country, who have historically faced custom integrations, system updates, data storage fees and add-ons at high cost. The OpenLattice platform also enables use of existing ETL tools and seamless integration with police dispatch systems, emergency medical calls, healthcare records, and online prescription systems across partners who have committed to data sharing and collaboration. Secondly, OpenLattice is developing a new, proprietary algorithm for record linkage that employs a promising but as-yet commercially untested technique: a multilayer perceptron neural network, more commonly known as deep learning. In pilot research, the linking algorithm has already demonstrated success rivaling—and sometimes exceeding—current state of the art linking technologies. In Phase I, OpenLattice will continue to improve ontologies, integration tools, and the deep learning neural network, and test on publicly available datasets with dissimilar data types and formats, with manual confirmation of results. When successful, these innovations will address critical barriers to improving clinical practice in treating opioid addiction by enabling a more comprehensive continuum of care for those in treatment. Project Narrative: Large-scale and coordinated responses to several of the US’s hot-button public health and criminal justice issues, such as the opioid epidemic and mass incarceration, are complicated by poor resource sharing and the US government’s highly fractured jurisdictional authority. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop an efficient, scalable, cloud- based platform for hosting and linking highly sensitive state and local government databases at low cost, using (i) innovative data integration scripts and ontologies that standardize and scale capacity and (ii) technical advances in record de-duplication for linking databases. Data solutions would have tremendous societal impact on understandings of public health and the opioid epidemic by making drug treatment less fractured, saving lives and dramatically broadening contextual information, once data is broken out of silos.","Development of a secure, cloud-based platform to improve record linkage & cross-agency collaboration for the public sector: using deep learning & scalable data integrations to combat the opioid crisis",9622726,R43CE002937,[' '],NCIPC,"OPENLATTICE, INC.",R43,2018,225000,0.08961232027851096
"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health 7. Project Summary Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose.  Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied.  In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff’s Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a “teachable moment” in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses.  The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). 8. Project Narrative Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim’s nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived.  This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff’s Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9688417,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'empowered', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,101470,0.12008959521475139
"eDarkTrends: monitoring cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends of illicit synthetic opioids use PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of seizures and unintentional overdose fatalities related to illicit synthetic opioids in multiple states across the U.S. Submitted in response to NIDA PAR-16-055, Research Area 1 (Responses to sudden and severe emerging drug issues), this time-sensitive R21 application builds on interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Additions Research (CITAR) and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis) at Wright State University. The overall purposes of the proposed study are to (a) characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends, and (b) identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) from three ""cryptomarkets"" located in the Deep Web. The Specific Aims of the study are to: 1) Develop a semi-automated knowledge-based system, eDarkTrends, to collect and process data about illicit synthetic opioids supplied on cryptomarkets; 2a) Describe and monitor US-based supply trends of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets (e.g., trends in availability of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl analogs, U-47700, MT-45), including types of illicit synthetic opioids, prices, advertised purity, dosage and product forms, quantity supplied, and drug combinations; 2b) Identify new illicit synthetic opioid substances and product forms soon after they appear on cryptomarkets. The proposed study is significant because it will provide new information about illicit synthetic opioids and will identify new illicit synthetic opioids as soon as they appear on those markets. The key innovation is the development of a semi-automated system able to a) collect and analyze advertisement data from cryptomarkets and b) identify new emerging substances advertised on these markets. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study will collect and analyze data extracted from Deep Web cryptomarkets to characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends in the U.S, and will identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid-related terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) as soon as they appear on these markets. It will be the first system to apply semi-automated computational techniques to monitor the supply of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets.

"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids.

"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED.

"Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose Problematic prescription opioid use, defined as nonmedical use, misuse, or abuse of opioid medications, is epidemic in the US. Prescription opioid overdose deaths more than quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. Efforts by health care systems and payers to combat the opioid epidemic are impeded by a lack of accurate and efficient methods to identify individuals most at risk for problematic opioid use and overdose, leading to broad interventions that are burdensome to patients and expensive for payers. Payers are currently defining high risk and targeting interventions (e.g. pharmacy lock-in programs) based on individual risk factors, such as high opioid dosage, identified in prior studies using traditional statistical approaches. However, these traditional approaches have significant limitations, especially when handling large datasets with numerous variables, multi-level interactions, and missing data. Moreover, the prior studies focused on identifying risk factors rather than predicting actual risk. Alternatively, machine learning is an advanced technique that handles complex interactions in large data, uncovers hidden patterns, and yields precise prediction algorithms that, in many cases, are superior to those developed using traditional methods. Machine learning is widely used in activities from fraud detection to cancer genomics, but has not yet been applied to address the opioid epidemic. Accordingly, the proposed study will apply machine learning to develop prediction algorithms that can more accurately identify patients at high risk of problematic opioid use and overdose using data sources that are readily available to payers and health care systems. The project will build on existing academic-state partnerships to apply novel machine learning approaches to administrative claims data for all Medicaid beneficiaries in Pennsylvania (PA) and Arizona (AZ). The project will also link Medicaid data in AZ to electronic health records to capture clinical information (e.g., lab results, pain severity) not available in administrative data, along with death certificate data on lethal overdose. These data, covering 2007-2016, will be used to achieve two specific aims: (1) to develop and validate two separate prediction algorithms to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose; (2) to compare the accuracy of a prediction algorithm that integrates clinical data with Medicaid claims versus a claims-based approach alone to identify patients at risk of problematic opioid use and opioid overdose. The machine learning approaches will include random forests and TreeNet with representative classification trees, and the predictive ability (e.g., misclassification rates) of these algorithms will be compared to traditional statistical models. Given the high prevalence of mental health/substance use disorders (~50%) and opioid utilization (>20%) among Medicaid enrollees and the lack of adequate prediction algorithms, Medicaid is an ideal setting for the proposed project. These analyses will provide the partnering Medicaid programs with valuable information and tools that they can apply to more precisely target interventions to prevent problematic opioid use and overdose. Prescription opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015, and drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury deaths among adults in the United States. This project will use innovative machine learning methods and readily available data for Medicaid beneficiaries in two states hard hit by the epidemic – Pennsylvania and Arizona – to develop algorithms to accurately predict who is at risk of problematic prescription opioid use and overdose. This information will empower health systems, payers, and policymakers to more effectively target interventions to prevent prescription opioid misuse and its consequences.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Problematic Prescription Opioid Use and Opioid Overdose,9421755,R01DA044985,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', 'Genomics', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Urine', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer genomics', 'clinical predictors', 'combat', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'milligram', 'model building', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'prevent', 'programs', 'service utilization', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,601139,0.1887747474866128
"Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the  top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent  hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the  activities of daily living. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase  quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a  fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices  require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of  showing caregivers how falls occur.  Our goal is to deploy and demonstrate NestSense (also known as SafelyYou), an online fall detection  system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to passively detect falls for patients with AD and  related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL will confirm the fall  detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms. We will demonstrate it for 100  patients in 13 memory care facilities. Memory care facilities can select parameters that matter for  specific patients; for ex., some patients wake up frequently during the night while others should  be assisted when they attempt to leave the bed at night. It does not require action of individuals  / caregivers such as wearing a fall pendant and is therefore well-suited for individuals with ADRD.  We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence)  approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will  call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The human can monitor  several facilities at a given time.  This project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 13 memory care facilities,  recruited through our previous (IRB approved) pilot. The work will leverage our previous three  pilots. • Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting a proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. • Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility from  the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to  clinical benefits including a reduction of falls from 13 and 11 in the first 2 months to 2 in the  final month, due to video review with care staff. • Pilot 3 (ongoing): We demonstrated scalability and further acceptance by deploying the system in  13 facilities of the Carlton, Integral Senior Living, Pacifica and SRG networks, totaling 100  patients already monitored by our system (offline). The pilot proposed for this SBIR Phase I will translate the 100 cameras in these facilities into a  real-time fall detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL support.  Compared to a 3-month baseline from the 100 cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on results described in previous clinical trials with 150+  participants [8,14]. The proposed NestSense system uses off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to perform detection of  safety-critical events for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia patients in memory care  facilities. It does not rely on active use from the patients or caregivers (e.g., through wearing  any kind of device). The NestSense technology provides the first robust non-wearable fall detection  tuned specifically to the privacy-security tradeoffs of dementia care. It provides an answer to  today’s technology gaps (far from 100% reliability) by use of a Human-in-the Loop (HIL) paradigm to  enable a quick rollout of the technology. Following the acceptance of privacy safety tradeoffs of  our system by patients, family, and memory care staff in the Carlton, Integral Senior Living,  Pacifica and SRG networks, we have deployed the system in offline mode in 13 facilities of the  network, monitoring 100 patients. The research, implementation, and deployment work encompassed in  this SBIR Phase I will provide validation that the existing prototype can be rolled out to a proof  of concept, operational in real-time mode, with HIL, to reduce fall-related hospitalizations and  time spent on the ground. The pilot follows 3 previous pilots, the most recent of which deploys  cameras with these 100 patients in offline mode to study the effect on the fall rate of  occupational therapist review of fall video in memory care.

"Using existing data to understand and ameliorate risk in opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, leading to unprecedented levels of overdose deaths and other harms. Effective treatment for opioid use disorders is available, in the form of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine. However, there are significant questions about the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization during and after treatment, and unplanned treatment cessation. What is the magnitude of these risks, and what patient, treatment setting, and provider factors may contribute to or protect against risk? Additionally, it is increasingly clear that more sophisticated approaches to patient assessment and treatment planning than are currently used are needed to minimise risk. We aim to: 1. Determine the magnitude of risk for specific adverse clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalization and ED presentation, and unplanned treatment cessation) during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; 2. Identify patient, treatment setting, and provider risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT with methadone and buprenorphine; and 3. Develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at greatest risk of adverse clinical outcomes during and after OAT. To achieve these aims, this project will use existing population-based Australian data on OAT, linked to several health and criminal justice datasets to provide a rich understanding of treatment exposures and outcomes. These data will be used to inform strategies to guide the delivery of high-quality treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States. Specifically, the project will provide data about the magnitude of risk of adverse clinical outcomes during specific treatment and post-treatment periods, and identify patient, treatment setting and provider factors that influence risk. Additionally, it will use innovative machine learning techniques to demonstrate the potential for routinely collected data to be used to assess patient risk at point-of-care, allowing for the development of tailored treatment plans that minimize risk and maximize treatment retention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid agonist therapy is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder, including prescription opioid use disorder. However, important questions about safety and risks during treatment remain unanswered.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9357691,U01MH110925,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'biobehavior', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular marker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'success', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2017,4969685,0.028325747468173
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9266749,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phonation', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,600547,0.15859456239966774
"Predicting Appropriate Admission of Bronchiolitis Patients in the Emergency Room Abstract  Bronchiolitis is the most common illness leading to hospitalization in young children. For children under age two, bronchiolitis incurs an annual total inpatient cost of $1.73 billion. Each year in the U.S., 287,000 emergency department (ED) visits occur because of bronchiolitis, with a hospital admission rate of 32-40%. Due to a lack of evidence and objective criteria for managing bronchiolitis, ED disposition decisions (hospital admission or discharge to home) are often made subjectively resulting in significant practice variation. Studies reviewing admission need suggest that up to 29% of admissions from the ED are unnecessary. About 6% of ED discharges for bronchiolitis result in ED returns with admission. These inappropriate dispositions waste limited healthcare resources, increase patient and parental distress, expose patients to iatrogenic risks, and worsen outcomes.  Clinical guidelines are designed to reduce practice variation and improve clinicians’ decision making. Existing guidelines for bronchiolitis offer limited improvement in patient outcomes. Methodological shortcomings include that the guidelines provide no specific thresholds for ED decisions to admit or to discharge, have an insufficient level of detail, and do not account for differences in patient and illness characteristics including co-morbidities.  Predictive models are frequently used to complement clinical guidelines, reduce practice variation, and improve clinicians’ decision making. Used in real time, predictive models can present objective criteria supported by historical data for an individualized disease management plan and guide admission decisions. However, existing predictive models for bronchiolitis patients in the ED have limitations, including low accuracy and the assumption that the actual ED disposition decision was appropriate. To date, no operational definition of appropriate admission exists. No model has been built based on appropriate admissions, which include both actual admissions that were necessary and actual ED discharges that were unsafe.  To fill the gap, the proposed project will: (1) Develop an operational definition of appropriate hospital admission for bronchiolitis patients in the ED. (2) Develop and test the accuracy of a new model to predict appropriate hospital admission for a bronchiolitis patient in the ED. (3) Conduct simulations to estimate the impact of using the model on bronchiolitis outcomes. The project will produce a new predictive model that can be operationalized to guide and improve disposition decisions for bronchiolitis patients in the ED. Broad use of the model would reduce iatrogenic risk, patient and parental distress, healthcare use, and costs and improve outcomes for bronchiolitis patients. If the model proves to be accurate and associated with improved outcomes, future study will test the impact of using it in a randomized controlled trial following its implementation into an existing electronic medical record to facilitate real-time decision making. Each year, many young children present to the emergency department (ED) because of bronchiolitis, but are inappropriately disposed. The new predictive model will standardize hospital admission practice and guide and improve disposition decisions for bronchiolitis patients in the ED. Broad use of the model will reduce ED returns, hospital admissions, and costs and increase safe discharges.",Predicting Appropriate Admission of Bronchiolitis Patients in the Emergency Room,9328146,R21HL128875,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Bronchiolitis', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'hospital admission rate', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'wasting']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2017,129668,0.043627410618660774
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9353310,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2017,157988,0.05051158436118139
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9341305,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'portability', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,166794,0.08836914036154103
"Opioid Use and Safety in US Nursing Homes PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Nationwide use of prescription opioids quadrupled to more than 240 million prescriptions per year between 1999 to 2010. This increase has been accompanied by an alarming rise in opioid misuse and abuse, addiction, and fatal and nonfatal overdoses. In response to this growing national epidemic, the Department of Health and Human Services has called for the creation of clear opioid prescribing guidelines and further developing the evidence base to guide opioid prescribing for the management of pain. To date, guidelines have largely focused on opioid use in younger adults despite the unique issues facing older adults (≥65 years old) including a large burden of pain, extensive analgesics use, and recent increase in drug overdose-related deaths in the elderly population. Prior guidelines have provided no direction regarding appropriate opioid use to treat pain in nursing home residents. This is problematic due to the high prevalence of chronic pain in nursing home residents as well as age-related vulnerability to adverse drug events due to changes in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and higher prevalence of multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy in this population as compared to noninstitutionalized older adults.  Using an in-house national repository of Minimum Data Set 3.0 – a federally required clinical assessment of all residents in Medicare or Medicaid certified nursing homes – merged to Medicare Part A and D and facility-level characteristics in CASPER (Certification and Survey Provider and Enhanced Reporting) from 2011-2013, this proposal addresses the evidence gap in safe opioid use in US nursing home residents with three specific aims: 1) to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and facility-level correlates of opioid use in terms of duration of use (acute vs. chronic), duration of action (short- vs. long-acting), and dose in “morphine equivalents”; 2) to estimate the incidence of opioid-related drug overdoses and identify resident- and drug regimen-related risk factors for opioid overdose; and 3) to evaluate the comparative safety of specific commonly-initiated opioids in terms of serious adverse health outcomes (all-cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, fractures, and bowel obstruction). Methodological innovations include the use of multilevel modeling and targeted maximum likelihood estimation approaches. This proposal is directly relevant to the approximately 1.4 million older adults living in US nursing homes on any given day – many of whom will receive opioids while institutionalized. The knowledge generated will inform stakeholders on how opioids are used in this population, the risk of overdose when using opioids, and the comparative safety of short- and long- term use of commonly initiated opioids in the nursing home setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 1.4 million US adults live in nursing homes on any given day; many experience acute and chronic pain often treated with opioid analgesics despite the potential risks associated with these medications. This study will describe the resident and facility risk factors associated with receiving opioids, risk factors for opioid overdose, and the comparative safety of commonly-initiated opioids.

"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9259974,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'empowered', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,464095,0.12008959521475139
"eDarkTrends: monitoring cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends of illicit synthetic opioids use PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of seizures and unintentional overdose fatalities related to illicit synthetic opioids in multiple states across the U.S. Submitted in response to NIDA PAR-16-055, Research Area 1 (Responses to sudden and severe emerging drug issues), this time-sensitive R21 application builds on interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Additions Research (CITAR) and the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis) at Wright State University. The overall purposes of the proposed study are to (a) characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends, and (b) identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) from three ""cryptomarkets"" located in the Deep Web. The Specific Aims of the study are to: 1) Develop a semi-automated knowledge-based system, eDarkTrends, to collect and process data about illicit synthetic opioids supplied on cryptomarkets; 2a) Describe and monitor US-based supply trends of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets (e.g., trends in availability of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl analogs, U-47700, MT-45), including types of illicit synthetic opioids, prices, advertised purity, dosage and product forms, quantity supplied, and drug combinations; 2b) Identify new illicit synthetic opioid substances and product forms soon after they appear on cryptomarkets. The proposed study is significant because it will provide new information about illicit synthetic opioids and will identify new illicit synthetic opioids as soon as they appear on those markets. The key innovation is the development of a semi-automated system able to a) collect and analyze advertisement data from cryptomarkets and b) identify new emerging substances advertised on these markets. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study will collect and analyze data extracted from Deep Web cryptomarkets to characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends in the U.S, and will identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid-related terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) as soon as they appear on these markets. It will be the first system to apply semi-automated computational techniques to monitor the supply of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets. The findings will inform public health interventions and policy responses.",eDarkTrends: monitoring cryptomarkets to identify emerging trends of illicit synthetic opioids use,9384827,R21DA044518,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Area', 'Award', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computational Technique', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Grant', 'Health Professional', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Infodemiology', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Liquid substance', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nose', 'Ohio', 'Ontology', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Powder dose form', 'Prevention', 'Price', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Security', 'Seizures', 'Semantics', 'Sentinel', 'Side', 'Source', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Transact', 'U-47700', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'carfentanil', 'design', 'dosage', 'drug market', 'drug testing', 'encryption', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'social media', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,223715,0.043979532529751564
"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9174752,U01MH110925,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'biobehavior', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'molecular marker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'success', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2016,3940345,0.028325747468173
"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.            ",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9026192,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Analgesics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,578991,0.15859456239966774
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9242212,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2016,162518,0.05051158436118139
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9133378,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall injury', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,166809,0.08836914036154103
"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.        ",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9124571,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Geographic state', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Laws', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'empowered', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'novel', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'rural area', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,501918,0.12008959521475139
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall).

"HopScore: An Electronic Outcomes-Based Emergency Triage System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this self-contained health information technology (IT) pilot is to refine and prospectively evaluate a novel, outcomes-based emergency department (ED) triage tool. The tool, HopScore' (developed at Johns Hopkins) aims to support objective triage decisions and improve patient differentiation based on time- sensitive and critical patient outcomes. HopScore uses easily obtained patient demographic and clinical information commonly collected at ED triage to predict patients risk for critical outcomes (i.e., i-hospital mortality, intensive care unit admission, emergent surgery or cardiac catheterization) and general inpatient admission. HopScore addresses deficiencies in the current standard, Emergency Severity Index (ESI) triage tool used by 72% of EDs across the United States (US). Deficiencies of ESI include: (1) no link to critical patient outcomes, (2) a strong reliance on trige evaluator's subjective judgment which results in variable application, (3) poor distribution (i.e., discrimination) of patients across the 5-level index; almost half of all patients nationally are undifferentiated, classified as acuity level 3. At our urban and community ED study sites, the proportion level 3 is 57% and 64%, respectively.  Evidence from previous retrospective studies conducted by or team suggest that compared to ESI, HopScore will improve patient safety and drive more efficient distribution of limited ED resources. To evaluate these hypotheses, the specific aims of the application are to: (1) refine the HopScore decision tree algorithm for implementation using separate urban, community, and nationally representative ED populations, (2) design and develop HopScore as a software application that provides swift and interpretable triage decision-support, (3) execute a phased implementation toward consistent use in clinical practice at Johns Hopkins (urban) and Howard County General (community) EDs, (4) prospectively evaluate the HopScore application's usability and impact on patient and operational outcomes compared to ESI (i.e., pre- and post- intervention) in these same settings. The overarching goal of the proposed health IT project is to develop a usable triage tool implemented in clinical practice that has a positive impact on both patient and operational outcomes for a crowded inner-city and community ED. The Johns Hopkins ED provides care to a predominantly low income (64% uninsured or underinsured) and minority (71% African-American) population responsive to AHRQ's mission to support priority populations. Overall, the application is in-line with AHRQ's general IT portfolio goals to anticipate future needs and disseminate evidence on the effectiveness of health IT toward improving the quality, safety, and efficiency of healthcare delivery.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this health information technology (IT) pilot is to develop and evaluate a novel, outcomes- based emergency department (ED) triage tool (`HopScore').

"Continuous Fall Risk Monitoring System: Walking vs Activities of Daily Living    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to U.S. emergency departments and the primary etiology of accidental deaths in persons over the age of 65 years1. Interventions such as physical therapy, adjusting medications, or behavior changes can reduce the elderly fall rate2. Fall risk determination is needed to identify who may benefit from interventions. Changes in fall risk may occur suddenly or gradually, and are more likely to become apparent in the home environment as an individual goes about their normal activities of daily living (ADLs) rather than during a limited and periodic care provider assessment. Consequently, a continuous, all-in-one system that would monitor elderly individuals in the home for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls is needed to reduce falls in the elderly. To be effective, the monitoring device must be non-intrusive and socially acceptable. The long-term goal of this project is to [extend an existing non-intrusive, commercially available monitoring system capable of location tracking, physiologic monitoring, and alerting to also assess fall risk in real time; the system would consider factors such as frequent bathroom use, fitful sleep and changes in gait characteristics]. The monitor for the proposed research has a watch form factor, is worn at the wrist, and has demonstrated high acceptance rates by elderly users. Research has shown that abnormal gait is indicative of fall risk, leading to the use of a variety of measurements of gait in fall risk determinations. To analyze gait from data gathered during ADLs, it is necessary to differentiate periods of walking, which can then be analyzed for abnormal characteristics. The purpose of this Phase I proposal is to test the [feasibility of using tri-axial acceleration data gathered from a commercially available wrist monitor to recognize periods of walking. Walking data can then be used in conjunction with other system data to] make inferences about changes in fall risk. Thirty elderly (aged 65 and over), ambulatory volunteers residing in an independent living facility will be recruited. The volunteers will be asked to engage in normal ADLs while being monitored over a 4-hour time period. During the study, volunteers will be videotaped, monitored using the wrist device, and monitored using a body-area sensor network technology developed at the University of Virginia. The specific aims of this project will be to: 1) determine if it is feasible to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using the presence of frequencies generally associated with walking in wrist- gathered acceleration data as the differentiator, 2) determine whether individuals typically demonstrate a narrower range of walking frequencies than that suggested for the entire population, and 3) determine if it is feasible to use machine learning and time-series techniques to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using characteristics learned from walking and non-walking data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651. In order to reduce the number of falls, a continuous, non-intrusive, convenient monitoring system in an acceptable form factor which will monitor elderly individuals in their home environment for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls needs to be developed. The long-term goal of this project is to develop such a system; the proposed project would take the necessary step of identifying and differentiating between walking and other normal activities [so that data gathered during walking can be used to recognize changes in stability for an individual, and then can be used in conjunction with other system data already being automatically collected in real-time to recognize an increased probability of falling both during walking or other activities.]           Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651.

"Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Falls among the elderly, one of the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions, are a major health problem. Several studies have identified quantifiable gait markers that appear to distinguish between elderly ""fallers"" and non-fallers. These studies have relied on data acquired in gait-laboratories. Extending gait assessment capability, and falls detection, into the home could provide valuable before-the-fact information on gait weakness evolution, which in turn could be used to assess the efficiency of counter measures. Current mobile gait analysis techniques are insufficient because they rely on compliance or are too intrusive. The development of a new gait assessment and falls monitor is proposed. The device is passive and obtains gait data from sensing floor vibrations as well as a minimally invasive wireless device, precluding the need to walk on special surfaces or be observed by cameras. This study's principal aim is to validate the device's performance through a comparison with accepted gait assessment techniques at the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Gait lab at the University of Virginia Health System   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents. Fall-related injuries are among the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and are a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions. The cost of falls to the national economy is significant. In 1994 the total cost due to falls was estimated to be $20.2 billion. This number is expected to climb to $32.2 billion by 2020. One suggestion for reducing the number of falls has been the creation of a fall risk assessment for institutional residents, an important component of which is gait assessment. In view of the results obtained during the Phase I effort, it appears that the floor sensor system may be able to answer a well defined need for which there is presently no other solution that promises to be as readily implementable and for which the market potential is significant.           Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring Notice Number: NOT-OD-10-034) Notice Title: NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Transfer Technology Research Grants (R43/R44 and R41/R42) through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents.

"A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The people at greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get life-saving medication. Justice-involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to receiving bup for these individuals are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual motivation. Our prior research shows that delivering individual level treatment engagement interventions increase the rate at which individuals receive bup. Thus, our solution is to improve engagement in bup treatment among justice-involved individuals by 1) “disrupting” system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral by using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot to make the referral, and 2) addressing low individual motivation by programming the chatbot to deliver the BNI itself, without the need for a trained professional. Aim 1: Design and develop a functional prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement. Milestones: (a) human-centered design (including focus groups) with all stakeholders; and (b) creation of a functional chatbot using ML and NLP that is integrated with a mobile application, an application program interface server, and an administrator portal. Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to BNI Chatbot or Treatment-as-Usual (TAU). Hypothesis 1. The BNI Chatbot group will have a higher percentage of participants attending their first bup appointment than the TAU group at 4 weeks (Primary outcome). Hypothesis 2. The BNI Chatbot group will demonstrate higher ratings of readiness and intention to engage in bup treatment, and lower opioid use, as measured by urine toxicology tests, than the TAU group at 4 weeks (Secondary outcomes). Hypothesis 3. The BNI Chatbot group will demonstrate higher ratings of satisfaction than the TAU group. PROJECT NARRATIVE Justice-involved individuals with Opioid Use Disorder coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine, a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of overdose death by half.

"A Wearable, Biomarker-Tracking Device Platform Using Machine Learning and Predictive Technology for Positive Behavior Change. Project Summary/Abstract Behaivior is developing a patent-pending platform to predict and prevent addiction relapses and overdoses by treating those in recovery with timely interventions using wearables (like an advanced FitBit) and artificial intelligence. Knowing in real time when someone with opioid use disorder is at a high risk of relapsing revolutionizes the ability to intervene at the right moment to help people stay sober. Our research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about the specific information needed to be gathered in order to accurately detect when someone struggling with opioid use disorder is in a high risk opioid craving/obsession state and enabled the creation of a predictive model for just in time intervention. The number of deaths from opioid overdose is increasing every day, so reducing opioid addiction relapses will save lives and families and it will reduce rearrests, reincarcerations, and rehospitalizations. Over 23 million Americans are addicted to drugs and alcohol, and these addictions cost the U.S. $442 billion per year, according to the US Surgeon General’s office. The majority of treatment tools used to keep those in recovery sober have low or mixed success rates. Many people in recovery end up relapsing multiple times, with the heroin relapse rate around 90%. With the technology that we are developing, Behaivior will detect if someone in recovery is in a red alert craving or “obsession” state and then, using artificial intelligence, we will provide support in real time by connecting someone to a support network member and/or provide a customized digital intervention. The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around the human brain’s proclivity towards substances detrimental to human health and wellbeing, such as dangerous amounts of sugar, salt, and drugs, which is causing global health and safety risks. Inability to avoid these temptations shortens lifespans, increases healthcare costs, and strains resources. This team uses machine learning and pattern recognition AI to identify and react to factors that result in destructive human behaviors. While the initial focus is opioids, this unsupervised learning AI could, in subsequent iterations, be used to identify and react to any behavior -- such as unsafe driving, binge eating, or anger management. Helping people identify the precursors to their behaviors could serve as a type of biofeedback that gives them and their support networks timely and individualized insights, preventions, and interventions, resulting in cost and health benefits across many populations. Project Narrative Behaivior is developing a system to predict and prevent opioid addiction relapses and overdoses using wearables and artificial intelligence for timely interventions. Our innovation lowers relapse and overdose rates and improves treatment adherence, which we anticipate will mitigate pain points such as higher treatment costs insurers currently pay from patient relapses, will reduce emergency room and first responder costs, and will ease (or alleviate) employers’ pain points such as poorer employee productivity and the added training and replacement costs. Through this program, Team Behavior will explore how to best tailor our technology for our likely first payers and validate the next potential customer segment we should pursue.","A Wearable, Biomarker-Tracking Device Platform Using Machine Learning and Predictive Technology for Positive Behavior Change.",10085849,R43DA046149,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Binge Eating', 'Biofeedback', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Custom', 'Dangerousness', 'Devices', 'Employee', 'Family', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heroin', 'Human', 'Innovation Corps', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Obsession', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'addiction', 'anger management', 'behavior change', 'cost', 'craving', 'digital', 'first responder', 'fitbit', 'global health', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rearrest', 'reincarceration', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'sobriety', 'success', 'sugar', 'support network', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'unsafe driving', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDA,"BEHAIVIOR, LLC",R43,2020,55000,0.08232925959819458

"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,10020322,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'memory care', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2020,493633,0.07183191023013677
"Online Evidence of Withdrawal Self-Medication PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Withdrawal symptoms from opioid use can be severe and are major contributing factors to relapse and continuing misuse. Many opioid users are actively experimenting with “remedies” that can alleviate withdrawal, and they are discussing their effectiveness in blogs and forums. In this pilot study we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and human expertise to examine over 50,000 recent posts in two Reddit forums OpiatesRecovery and Opiates to assess systematically which remedies are being used, how they are being used, and what are the reported consequences of such self-help experimentation. We will create a curated database of user-reported “remedies.” Information will be semiautomatically extracted from the online, self-reported use of alternative treatments (i.e., other prescription drugs, over the counter medications, food supplements, activities such as meditation and yoga). A team of a pharmacologist, physician, and ethnographer will evaluate database entries to uncover (1) potential harm associated with uncontrolled and unsupervised experimentation, (2) potentially effective available treatments (e.g., traditional medicine), (3) potentially promising compound leads, and (4) patients' needs and issues that are most important to them. Aim 1. To assemble an extensive database of opioid withdrawal and remedy-associated terminology from posts on OpiatesRecovery and Opiates Reddit communities. NLP will be used to build a language model that understands how words are used in context (word2vec). Aim 2. To develop a dataset of instances of self-reported remedy use from Reddit and conduct a bipartite network analysis of remedies and users. Using NLP tools and the word embedding model we will develop an exclusive dataset containing extracted information associated with remedies targeting withdrawal and craving. This aim will use elements of artificial intelligence and close human supervision to extract remedies, including variations of spelling, from the texts. The result of this aim will be a remedy database that includes spelling variations and slang references and a network analysis linking remedies and users. Aim 3. To organize, aggregate, and systematically assess information from mentions of remedy use. Potential compounds and other remedies will be classified to provide an initial assessment of their potential relevance to the opioid treatment process. This process will require the most human oversight and assessment. Network analysis tools will be used to assess and identify the relationships between the types of remedies and potential therapeutic effect and will create the benchmarks for similar future studies.

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our team’s expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship. Project Narrative This application will establish the Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network. The creation of this node will help facilitate research on substance and opioid misuse which are key components of NIH and federal government strategy to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with the current opioid and substance epidemics.

The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens).

We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research is to discover neurobiologically interpretable gene networks for addiction, specifically for cigarettes and opioids. To achieve this goal, we will apply a new multi-omics, multi-method framework—Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetII)—to identify gene networks associated uniquely with cigarette or opioid outcomes and networks shared across these addictions. GNetII includes genome-wide epistasis, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, gene network construction, and Lines-of-Evidence methods. These cornerstone methods will enable integration of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in living subjects, postmortem human brain data (RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and variant genotypes) from addiction case and control decedents (deceased individuals), and public omics data. Cigarette smoking and opioid outcomes are genetically correlated, and we have parallel GWAS and multi-omics brain data available in two highly relevant tissues, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, for both of these addictions. Cigarettes and opioids are leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. These addictions affect millions of U.S. adults and youths and are highly heritable (e.g., 54% and 71% for opioid addiction and nicotine dependence, respectively). GWAS analyses have identified 300+ loci at genome-wide significance for smoking. GWAS for opioids are farther behind in sample size, but genome-wide significant loci are emerging. Neurobiological effects of known loci are largely unknown, and more loci and connections among the loci are still to be discovered. We hypothesize that applying new big data science methods to large-scale GWAS and gene regulation data in brain tissue will reveal previously undetected relationships (such as epistatic interactions between genes) and add knowledge of the neurobiology underlying addiction. We propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Integrate multi-omics data to discover cigarette-associated gene networks.  Aim 2: Integrate multi-omics data to discover opioid-associated gene networks.  Aim 3: Integrate multi-omics data to find general addiction-associated gene networks. For cigarettes, Aims 1 and 3 will leverage GWAS (N=528,259) and multi-omics data in postmortem human brain from active smoker and nonsmoker decedents (N=262). For opioids, Aims 2 and 3 will use GWAS (N=49,178) and multi-omics brain data from opioid overdose case and control decedents (N=147). Analyses will be performed on Summit, the world's fastest supercomputer, which will greatly improve the likelihood of neurobiologically meaningful discoveries. Our study will capture complex networks across the genome to find previously unknown genes, as well as help explain the neurobiological underpinnings for the growing number of genetic loci associated with cigarette or opioid outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Addictions to cigarettes and opioids are public health epidemics. The goal of this study is to identify gene networks that predispose individuals to these addictions. We will leverage cutting-edge methods (such as Explainable Artificial Intelligence), large-scale genome-wide association data in living subjects, and multiple omics data in postmortem human brain to further our understanding of the neurobiology underlying addiction.",Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids.,10056112,R01DA051913,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cigarette', 'Complex', 'Cotinine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Epidemic', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Oranges', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain tissue', 'case control', 'cigarette addiction', 'cigarette smoking', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'random forest', 'smoking addiction', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'young adult']",NIDA,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2020,597080,0.035930738108947945
"Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis PROJECT SUMMARY  The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder, which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providers’ perceptions. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records, corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3) machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Opioid use disorder is a key driver of the U.S. opioid overdose crisis, yet treatment remains both underused and unequal. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying modifiable structural predictors of treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder. The results of this project are expected to inform multilevel interventions equitably deliver treatment for opioid use disorder, ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders, and reduce health disparities.",Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis,10039535,K99DA051534,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'African American', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caucasian American', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'forest', 'health administration', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'novel strategies', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial disparity', 'skills', 'social', 'standard of care', 'success', 'treatment disparity']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,179582,0.1055988862174269
"Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment. PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid overdose rates have risen six-fold since the late 1990s and presently claim the lives of over 130 Americans each day. Amongst treatment options for opioid dependence, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with opioid substitutes, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, are the only treatments for which effectiveness has been confirmed by empirical study. While methadone maintenance is effective for reducing mortality over the course of treatment, individuals remain at significant risk of overdose death during the initial phase of treatment (methadone induction). On the other hand, although buprenorphine has lower risk of mortality, it is associated with greater risk of withdrawal and relapse. Therefore, patient monitoring is critical for effective MAT, improved treatment retention and reduced likelihood of overdose death. Yet, MAT is most commonly administered on an outpatient basis, limiting the time periods during which the patient can be actively assessed. OpiAID is developing the Strength Band Platform, a wearable device featuring a multi-sensor array and artificial intelligence to facilitate patient monitoring during MAT for opioid use disorder. This device will provide an expanded range of biometric variables enabling prediction of opioid use and withdrawal in real world settings. Real-time monitoring of patients will allow appropriate and timely interventions, directly improving the outcomes for the patients undergoing the treatment. There are currently no FDA approved, commercially available, wearable products for monitoring opioid use in real world settings. This Phase I SBIR program consists of two Specific Aims designed to develop the Strength Band Platform using a commercially available clinically validated armband. The first Specific Aim is to collect biometric variables from patients and develop prediction algorithms through supervised learning. In the second Specific Aim, barriers to end-user adoption, compliance and social stigma will be identified through focus groups and solutions based on the feedback will be incorporated into development frameworks. Completion of this Phase I project will produce a proof-of-concept platform which will undergo further development and evaluation for commercialization. Phase II research will focus on developing fully functional user and practitioner interfaces and completing multi-region clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness of the platform for improving patient outcomes. OpiAID will leverage extensive partnerships in the opioid dependence treatment community in Wilmington, NC to evaluate performance of the device and complete the clinical trials. Ultimately, identifying periods of increased risk of relapse will allow provision of just-in-time interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE To address the opioid crisis, OpiAID is developing a wearable biometric device platform that will predict use and withdrawal in patients undergoing medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder. Using a wearable device for real-time monitoring with predictive capability will allow timely interventions resulting in fewer deaths and relapses.","Development of the Strength Band Platform, a Technology Assisted Therapy Platform to Aid with Opioid Abuse Treatment.",10138614,R43DA050399,"['Abstinence', 'Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drops', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Guns', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methadone', 'Monitor', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Rotation', 'Opioid replacement therapy', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'base', 'commercialization', 'contingency management', 'craving', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'illicit opioid', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'methadone treatment', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose death', 'overdose risk', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'supervised learning', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"OPIAID, LLC",R43,2020,276533,0.1479793623112816
"Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The opioid crisis is the deadliest drug epidemic in American history and new approaches are needed. One novel approach includes predicting likelihood of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment retention by assessing someone’s risk of early departure from treatment. Current methods to improve treatment retention rely on providers using their intuition to identify when an individual is at risk of leaving treatment early in order to intervene, which often happens too late. Mobile health and machine learning predictive analytics offer a new opportunity to personalize OUD treatment, improve retention in OUD care, and mitigate the risk of relapse and overdose episodes. Project Motivate will combine physiological and behavioral data from disparate sources in order to predict when an individual is at risk of early departure from OUD treatment. This data will be displayed in a user-friendly manner so that providers can more effectively support patients to remain in treatment with timely intervention and responses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early departure from opioid use disorder treatment programs is common, with early termination rates over 50% for many opioid use disorder treatments, putting individuals at an increased risk of relapsing, overdose and death. Using physiological monitoring tools to predict the likelihood that someone is at risk of early departure from opioid use disorder treatment due to worsening symptoms and/or cravings will allow for proactive interventions that will improve treatment retention. Making an impact here will not only save lives, but it will also lower medical costs, municipal emergency response costs, recidivism, workplace accidents, lost workplace productivity and costs to families.",Project Motivate: A digital motivation and prediction platform to improve treatment retention and reduce relapse in opioid use disorder,10013066,R43DA051279,"['Accidents', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dropout', 'Early treatment', 'Emergency response', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Heroin', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Municipalities', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prescription drug overdose', 'Productivity', 'Professional counselor', 'Program Development', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residential Treatment', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visualization software', 'Weather', 'Workplace', 'Wrist', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'dashboard', 'data visualization', 'digital', 'early onset', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'motivational intervention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient engagement', 'personalized intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'recidivism', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'sleep quality', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies', 'wearable device']",NIDA,"BIOMOTIVATE, LLC",R43,2020,251492,0.15205879185402119
"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10049339,R61AG068926,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Prevention Guidelines', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exercise prescription', 'exercise program', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'patient portal', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'rural area', 'screening', 'smartphone Application', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2020,250020,0.017242896265207742
"Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care Project Abstract The opioid epidemic is the U.S.'s most widespread behavioral public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in 2016 compared to deaths due to HIV at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. However, only a fraction of persons with OUD access MAT, and treatment non-adherence and drop out is common. There is a dire need to improve systems to address these issues and to expand the use of MAT for many patients who are out of care. This R44 STTR application responds to RFA-DA-19-020, “HEAL Initiative: America's Startups and Small Businesses Build Technologies to Stop the Opioid Crisis.” It joins an outstanding scientific team at UCLA and a small business that has developed, Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) -- a software platform that by integrating with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) improves clinical management of patients by primary care providers (PCPs) treating patients with OUD using MAT. OARS platform uses a dashboard to show real-time measurement of patient achievements in recovery. It provides opportunities for patients to interact with their PCPs, allowing for better connection to and support from their PCPs. OARS platform features artificial intelligence to analyze information from the EHR and from patients to provide relapse risk assessment for patients receiving MAT for OUD, an innovation that sets OARS apart from other software solutions. The specific aim of Phase 1 of this STTR Fast Track proposal, is to modify the OARS platform for use in primary care settings by conducting interviews with PCPs (N=20) and their patients with OUD (N=40) in primary care settings to collect data on feasibility and acceptability of engaging with OARS to inform user- centered design of OARS. The specific aims of Phase 2 of this STTR Fast Track proposal are to: (1) employ a “stepped wedge” design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes across 6 treatment programs (N=200 treated patients) and (2) evaluate sustainability and return on investment of OARS implementation across 6 treatment programs. A commercialization plan documents progress to date for OARS platform and presents a market plan to improve both scale-up and quality of MAT services delivered by PCPs in primary care, which is a major contribution to addressing the ongoing opioid epidemic. Project Narrative With over 72,000 overdose deaths in 2017, of which 47,600 are attributable to opioid overdose, the opioid epidemic has become North America’s most widespread behavioral public health problem. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly efficacious. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS), comprises of a healthcare team portal connected to a patient mobile application, to provide opioid related education, promote connectedness with clinicians, and track MAT treatment progress. This STTR Fast Track proposal will conduct interviews with patients that will inform optimal design of OARS and utilize a “stepped wedge” effectiveness design to assess the effectiveness of OARS in improving opioid agonist treatment outcomes in primary care settings and evaluate sustainability and return on investment.",Technology Improving Success of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Primary Care,10212519,R42DA050398,"['Abstinence', 'Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'HIV', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'North America', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Suboxone', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'care providers', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'medical specialties', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mobile application', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'patient population', 'phase 2 testing', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse risk', 'scale up', 'social stigma', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'user centered design', 'waiver']",NIDA,"Q2I, LLC",R42,2020,833315,0.16423389742321692
"Transforming Kidney Care in the Emergency Department using Artificial Intelligence Driven Clinical Decision Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this proposal is to determine best-practice methods for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI)- derived insights into emergency care. This investigation will use the iterative development and evaluation of an AI-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system to prevent or mitigate acute kidney injury (AKI) as a reference use-case. We are responding to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice: Health Services Research Priorities for Achieving a High Value Healthcare System (NOT-HS-18-015), calling for research on prevention of disease through incorporation of AI into healthcare and on interventions to prevent kidney disease progression. Emergency departments (EDs) deliver high-volume patient care in hazardous decision-making environments fraught with excessive cognitive loading and time-pressure. AI has potential to support ED clinician decisions by exploiting large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data to aid prognosis, extract signal from noise, and reduce untoward variability in practice. Despite AI’s fervent promotion, translation to practice is rare and means to incorporate AI that is trustworthy, transparent, and explainable in the ED are unknown. AKI is an important target for AI-driven predictive modeling. It is prevalent and strongly associated with adverse outcomes including dialysis and death, yet is under-recognized and therefore under-treated. In addition, many ED treatments inadvertently promote the progression of AKI and kidney disease. AKI prevention is achievable with evidence-based CDS at the point of care. We will use our AI-driven model, with proven capacity for early and reliable AKI risk estimation, to achieve the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop an AI-driven algorithm for promotion of AKI-focused clinical decision-making in the ED. We will leverage previously developed AKI surveillance and prediction tools to generate a unified EHR-based algorithm that empowers ED clinician prevention of kidney disease progression. Aim 2: Translate the AI algorithm to an AKI-CDS system to enable in-depth study of Clinician-AI interactions in the ED. We will establish end-user requirements while creating data collection instruments to examine AI in the ED. Both efforts will support the development of the AKI-CDS system to pilot and investigate ED clinician perceptions of AI trustworthiness and explainability in preparation for multi-site implementation. Aim 3: Perform a multi-site effectiveness-implementation evaluation of the AKI-CDS system in the ED. We will implement the AI-driven CDS system across three ED study sites using a pragmatic investigational framework to perform effectiveness and implementation evaluations in parallel. The research proposed will generate new knowledge and tools to advance the study of AI in the ED, and will result in a scalable CDS product with the capacity to improve the quality of kidney care delivered to more than 1 million patients affected by AKI in the US each year.

"Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioi-related outcomes. Half of all ED visits are for a painful condition, and one third of all ED visits result in an opioid being prescribed. Moreover, in our pilot work, a quarter of patients surveyed at the ED study site reported non-medical opioid use in the prior three months. Despite the importance of this problem, strategies to reduce non-medical opioid use after an ED visit have not been well-studied. Our recent trial of a motivational intervention delivered to patients in the ED by a therapist resulted in modest reductions in non- medical use after the ED visit compared to a control condition. However, the intervention was unable to address the implications of opioids prescribed as a result of the ED encounter on post-ED opioid use behavior. This project will adapt the intervention for delivery after the ED visit through mobile technology in order to directly address the use of ED-provided opioids. Patients (n=600) will be recruited during an ED visit for a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention based on having used opioids non-medically in the prior three months and being given an opioid by an ED prescriber. In the intervention condition, interactive voice response calls will repeatedly assess non-medical opioid use and pain level and deliver intervention content. The intervention will include several potential actions that vary in intensity: assessment only, a brief message, extended messaging, or connection to a therapist by phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence stratey called reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously ""learn"" from the success of prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most likelyto reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call. The RCT will be complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation. The specific aims are to: (1) Adapt and enhance an existing motivational intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention intensity and duration through RL; (2) Examine the impact of the intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED visit; (3) Examine the impact of the intervention on driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent opioid-related ED visits. Secondary Aims are: (1) to examine differences in intervention effects between participants with high and low baseline levels of non-medical opioid use; and (2) to understand barriers and facilitators of implementation. This project will use a highly innovative strategy, artificial intelligence, to address a highly significant problem, non-medical opioid use. Ultimately, this study can lead to reductions in opioid- related harms and move forward the field of mobile health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-medical use of opioid pain medications has increased substantially over the last decade, and ensuring the safe use of opioids prescribed as part of medical care has become a critical public health priority. Emergency Departments (EDs) are on the front lines of this emerging public health problem. This randomized controlled trial will test the impact of a mobile health intervention, which incorporates an innovative artificial intelligenc component to determine intervention duration and intensity, on non-medical opioid use and related harms for adult ED patients treated with opioids and who have a history of non-medical opioid use.",Reducing Non-Medical Opioid Use: An automatically adaptive mHealth Intervention,9869872,R01DA039159,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Complement', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brief motivational intervention', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'comparison intervention', 'drugged driving', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'learning progression', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'nonmedical use', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'overdose risk', 'post intervention', 'prescription opioid', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment as usual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,547843,0.15859456239966774
"iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY The integrated research and training plans outlined in this K23 submission will prepare me for a career as a clinician-scientist conducting translational substance abuse research. My career goal is to perform hypothesis- driven original research investigations directed toward reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose. In this proposal, I intend to deploy wearable biosensors (small devices that continuously record physiology) to study the effects of therapeutic administration of opioid analgesics. I have already studied wearable biosensors in individuals receiving opioids; my preliminary data demonstrates that opioid-tolerant individuals have different biometric signals than non-tolerant individuals. This observation suggests that biosensors can be used to identify the onset of tolerance, an important event that correlates with higher doses of opioid analgesics, and higher risk of death from opioid overdose. Biosensor data management and analysis requires signal processing, data analytic, and machine learning techniques; these approaches are beyond the areas of traditional medical training. My short-term goal is to utilize this K23 award to fill my knowledge gaps in wearable biosensing and advanced data analysis so that I can generate ever more innovative responses to the problem of opioid prescribing, tolerance, misuse, addiction, and overdose. To optimize this important line of investigation, I have developed a training plan that includes: 1) completing a PhD through the Millennium PhD program; 2) expanding my skills in wearable biosensing and behavioral health-based research; 3) developing an understanding of signal processing and machine learning; 4) developing data analytic and data science skills; and 5) expanding my research presentation and dissemination skills. I will achieve these goals through directed coursework, focused seminars, and practical experience. My mentorship team of expert investigators who will ensure my productivity and success includes E. Boyer (primary mentor), D. Smelson, J. Fang, and P. Indic (secondary mentors), and D. Ganesan (advisor) My research plan has three specific aims: 1) to deploy a wearable biosensor technology to detect digital biomarkers associated with the initiation of opioid analgesic therapy in an opioid naïve population; 2) to use signal-processing analytics to identify transitions in digital biomarkers with progressive opioid use and to identify individual characteristics associated with this transition; and, 3) to apply and explore supervised learning algorithms that can predict transitions in digital biomarkers that herald the onset of opioid tolerance. To identify dynamic patterns in response to opioids, I will study the digital biomarkers of opioid-naïve patients with acute fractures who are prescribed opioid analgesics. Results will be used to develop “big data” approaches to apply predictive algorithms to identify the onset of opioid tolerance. This work has the potential to prevent development of problematic opioid use and will provide the basis for subsequent R01 submissions to implement sensor-based interventions triggered by the onset of tolerance in individuals receiving opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to opioids (both prescription and illicit) has reached staggering proportions: more than half of individuals who currently abuse heroin report that opioid abuse began with a prescription opioid. Dr. Carreiro has demonstrated that wearable biosensors can discriminate between individuals who are naïve to the effects of opioids from those who are opioid tolerant, a characteristic that increases risk for opioid-related death. This career development award will provide her with the training to use of wearable biosensors to identify the onset of opioid tolerance and the expertise to reach her ultimate goal of developing tools to prevent opioid-related death and increase the safety of opioid prescribing.",iTransform: Wearable Biosensors to Detect the Evolution of Opioid Tolerance in Opioid Naïve Individuals,9889092,K23DA045242,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug abuse', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heroin Abuse', 'Immersion', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Temperature', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'career', 'comparative', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'digital', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opiate tolerance', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid therapy', 'opioid use', 'prediction algorithm', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K23,2020,188616,0.16622871077756884
"Contextualized daily prediction of lapse risk in opioid use disorder by digital phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid use disorder is increasingly widespread, leading to devastating consequences and costs for patients and their families, friends, and communities. Available treatments for opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) are not successful at sustaining sobriety. The vast majority of people with SUD relapse within a year. Critically, they often fail to detect dynamic, day-by-day changes in their risk for relapse and do not adequately employ skills they developed or take advantage of support available through continuing care. The broad goals of this project are to develop and deliver a highly contextualized, lapse risk prediction models for forecasting day-by-day probability of opioid and other drug use lapse among people pursuing drug abstinence. This lapse risk prediction model will be delivered within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) mobile app, which has been established by RCT as a state-of-the-art mHealth system for providing continuing care services for alcohol and substance use disorders. To accomplish these broad goals, a diverse sample of 480 participants with opioid use disorder who are pursing abstinence will be recruited. These participants will be followed for 12 months of their recovery, with observations occurring as early as one week post-abstinence and as late as 18 months post-abstinence across participants in the sample. Well-established distal, static relapse risk signals (e.g., addiction severity, comorbid psychopathology) will be measured on intake. A range of more proximal, time-varying opioid (and other drug use) lapse risk signals will also be collected via participants’ smartphones. These signals include self-report surveys every two months, daily ecological momentary assessments, daily video recovery “check-ins”, voice phone call and text message logs, text message content, moment-by-moment location (via smartphone GPS and location services), physical activity (via smartphone sensors), and usage of the mobile A-CHESS Recovery Support app. The predictive power of these risk signals will be further increased by anchoring them within an inter-personal context of known people, locations, dates, and times that support or detract from participants’ abstinence efforts. Machine learning methods will be used to train, validate, and test opioid (and other drug) lapse risk prediction models based on these contextualized static and dynamic risk signals. These lapse risk prediction models will provide participant specific, day-by-day probabilistic forecast of a lapse to opioid (or other drug) use among opioid abstinent individuals. These lapse risk prediction models will be formally added to the A-CHESS continuing care mobile app at the completion of the project for use in clinical care. These project goals position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project’s goals are to develop and deliver a real-time model for forecasting day-by-day opioid use lapse among abstinent patients with opioid use disorder.

"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,10007879,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2020,156859,0.05051158436118139
"Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder The current opioid crisis is significantly impacting millions of lives, healthcare, social welfare, and the economy. Patient interactions with the treatment system coupled with results of completed studies create a wealth of data stored in disparate electronic sources. Therapists and health care providers with limited time and resources face challenges to access, integrate and monitor this vast data set for novel opportunities to improve care. Significant advances would include predicting when a patient will relapse out of a program, and also suggesting optimal personalized care strategies to reengage patients before this negative event occurs.  Survive-OUD will solve these challenges by providing a web-based therapist interface integrating survivor model artificial intelligence (AI) strategies. Based on multiple input data domains leveraged from existing electronic medical record sources, survivor recurrent neural networks will be trained to recognize when patients are likely to relapse or drop out of an OUD program. Examples of data domains that can be input to the network include patient demographics, medical and prescription data, engagement with therapy paradigms, and compliance with logistical program tasks. Furthermore, once a patient is noted as high risk, a second layer of algorithms will be developed to recommend a specific and personalized care strategy for retention based on existing best practices in the literature and clinical trials. Therefore, the Survive-OUD platform will also integrate with common literature database and clinical trial repositories. Utilizing an existing AI platform for searching, tagging, and extracting data from database sources, the innovative platform will close the loop on actionable results by recommending updated care options based on potential outcomes learned from best practices in existing literature. The AI architecture developed will greatly improve success rates in opioid addition programs and expand high quality healthcare.  While the commercialized Survive-OUD platform will integrate all features above, Phase I will target feasibility of data aggregation and AI algorithms to detect relapse and recommend intervention strategies. The innovative technical challenge in Phase I is to develop and validate targeted AI tools using data already being captured in patient workflow to allow early prediction of patient retention issues. More specifically, a prototype therapist interface and data network infrastructure will be developed to source personalized patient data as well as literature and clinical trial sources. Once the platform architecture has passed verification testing, it will be deployed in a field data collection study to determine usability and also provide a rich set of de-identified data for algorithm development. Collected data will then be used to train and test AI algorithms for early detection of patient dropout/relapse and appropriate treatment recommendation. The objective is to design, develop, and demonstrate feasibility of Survive-OUD, an artificial intelligence driven platform to integrate complex data sources, predict patient relapse, and recommend intervention strategies for individuals impacted by opioid use disorder. Currently millions of Americans suffer from an opioid use disorder (OUD) and program relapse rates are extremely high. Therefore, an advanced, bioinformatics platform that accurately predicts when OUD patients will drop out of programs and offers personalized prevention strategies would provide a novel clinical tool to help combat the opioid crisis in the U.S.","Survive-OUD: AI Platform to Integrate Complex Data Sources, Predict Relapse, and Recommend Interventions for Opioid Use Disorder",10133357,R43DA052916,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Face', 'Fentanyl', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Heroin', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Price', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Service delivery model', 'Social Welfare', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Update', 'Variant', 'algorithm development', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health care quality', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'patient population', 'personalized care', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'repository', 'retention rate', 'socioeconomics', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDA,"INSILICA, LLC",R43,2020,251348,0.08345898533210111
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers, investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center (CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission.

The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers, investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center (CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission. Project Narrative: Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs spanning a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use.

"Personalized Networks and Sensor Technology Algorithms of Eating Disorder Symptoms Predicting Eating Disorder Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are severe mental illnesses with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. The most widely used empirically supported treatment for EDs (cognitive behavior therapy) is only efficacious for ~50% of individuals. This low response rate is due to the fact that EDs are heterogeneous conditions with diverse symptom trajectories that are not adequately addressed in current “one-size-fits-all” psychotherapies. Until we can identify what maintains or exacerbates individual symptoms, clinicians will continue to have difficulty accurately predicting prognosis and will have no empirical guidance to develop targeted treatment plans to promote recovery. Our scientific premise, developed from our past work, is that the application of network theory will enable the identification of cognitive-behavioral symptom networks that maintain and ‘trigger’ EDs both between and within individuals. Our study goals are to (1) identify individual ED ‘trigger’ symptoms (cognitions, behaviors, affect, and physiology) and (2) correlate trigger symptoms with real-time physiological data to create an algorithm predicting onset of ED behaviors. These goals will ultimately identify symptoms that prevent full remission and lead to relapse. We will use a multiple units of analysis approach combined with novel, cutting-edge advances in network science. We will collect intensive real- time data on cognitions, behavior, affect, and physiology using mobile and sensor-technology from 120 individuals with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN), atypical AN, and bulimia nervosa across 30 days. At 1-month and 6-month follow ups we will assess ED outcomes (e.g., remission status, ED behaviors) to test if ‘trigger’ symptoms predict ED outcomes. Network science and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques will allow us, for the first time, to discover whether certain trigger symptoms predict worse outcomes. Specific aims are to (1) develop personalized networks to identify which cognitive, behavioral, affective, and physiological symptoms maintain EDs and predict ED outcomes and (2) utilize sensor data to identify physiological patterns both within and across people that correlate with core maintaining symptoms and that predict ED behaviors. The proposed research uses highly innovative methods, combining intensive longitudinal data collection methods, all remote procedures, novel advances in network science and sensor-technology, and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to answer previously unresolvable questions pinpointing which personalized symptoms trigger EDs. The proposed research has clinical impact. If we identify patterns that contribute to symptom network variation within individuals, these data will provide a model of personalized medicine for the entire field of psychiatry, as well as providing novel intervention targets to prevent and treat EDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will identify the maintaining symptoms of eating disorders within individuals. The proposed research has significant public health relevance, as it will lead to personalized, novel, effective treatments that promote full remission and decrease the high societal burden associated with eating disorders. The proposed research is relevant to NIH’s precision medicine initiative, as it will identify within-person, maintenance symptoms of eating disorders, leading to personalized treatments delivered via mobile or sensor technology.",Personalized Networks and Sensor Technology Algorithms of Eating Disorder Symptoms Predicting Eating Disorder Outcomes,10044077,R15MH121445,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binge Eating', 'Bulimia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Eating Disorders', 'Epilepsy', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'food restriction', 'innovation', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'severe mental illness', 'smartphone Application', 'standard care', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'treatment planning', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R15,2020,463165,0.02421687560459736
"DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics PROJECT SUMMARY DAT18-06 The personal, social, and public health burdens of substance use disorders (SUDs) in the United States have been compounded by the opioid epidemic and legalization of recreational and medical cannabis use. Traditionally, healthcare systems have referred patients with SUDs to specialists. Although SUD treatment is associated with improved outcomes, most people with SUDs remain unidentified and untreated. The magnitude of unmet need has led experts to recommend incorporating screening and assessment for SUDs into routine primary care (PC), to increase rates of diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. Despite extensive observational research, to our knowledge no randomized controlled trial has evaluated the impact of PC-based programs of screening and assessment on new SUD treatment. The proposed study takes advantage of a unique and fortuitous opportunity to evaluate the impact of a PC program of screening and assessment for SUDs on new diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. The Sustained Patient-centered Alcohol Related Care (SPARC) trial, completed in July 2018, was a rigorously-designed randomized implementation trial testing a multifaceted approach to improving care for unhealthy alcohol use. However, at the request of clinical leaders at Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) where the SPARC program was implemented, routine screening and assessment for opioid, cannabis, and other drug use disorders (CUD, OUD, and DUD, respectively) were added before the trial was launched in 22 KPWA PC clinics. As a result, the SPARC trial's implementation program—consisting of practice coaching, electronic health record (EHR) support, performance monitoring and feedback, and provider training—also targeted SUDs. Data from health system monitoring reports indicate the trial achieved high, sustained rates of screening for SUDs, exceeding the target of 80% of patients with PC visits. However, the SPARC trial was only funded to evaluate alcohol-related outcomes. The proposed study will rigorously evaluate the SPARC program's impact on the clinically meaningful primary outcome of new SUD treatment within 90 days of a primary care visit (Aim 1). To illuminate potential continued gaps in the quality of SUD care (Aim 2), we will use natural language processing (NLP) to extract and quantify reasons why: 1) patients reporting ≥4 DSM-5 symptoms of SUDs do not receive formal coded diagnoses of OUD, CUD, or DUD, and 2) why patients with newly diagnosed OUDs, CUDs, and DUDs do not received treatment. Most people with OUDs, CUDs, and other DUDs are never treated. An estimated 2.5-3.9% of US adults have past-year SUDs, and nearly 90% report no SUD treatment. Yet >84% of US adults have outpatient visits annually, and over half of these visits are in PC. If the proposed innovative study demonstrates that screening and assessment in PC increase SUD treatment, it would provide support for a widely endorsed yet previously untested approach to addressing a critically important gap in the quality of care for SUDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug use disorders associated with unhealthy opioid, cannabis, and other drug use are major public health concerns but most people with these disorders remain untreated. Experts recommend systematic screening and assessment in primary care as a way to improve SUD treatment, but the effectiveness of such programs is unknown. This study rigorously evaluates such a program through an opportunity created when screening and assessment for drug use disorders were unexpectedly added to a randomized, stepped wedge, 22-clinic trial originally planned to focus exclusively on alcohol use disorders.",DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics,9884229,R01DA047312,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohols', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Medical', 'Medical Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Shame', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'design', 'disability', 'health data', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'marijuana use', 'neglect', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'social', 'social stigma', 'therapy design']",NIDA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,323000,-0.02383913979128764
"Understanding the role of community determinants in opioid use disorder and program implementation factors influencing patient adherence to opioid agonist therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  To inform an effective response to the opioid epidemic, understanding the multilevel factors that influence risk of opioid use disorder (OUD) is critical. In addition, although the efficacy of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD is proven, long-term retention in treatment has been a challenge. Thus, efforts are needed to identify program implementation factors that can be strengthened to improve OUD treatment outcomes. The K01 Award will provide the candidate the requisite skills and mentored research experience necessary to meet her long-term goal of conducting independent, innovative research on OUD and its treatment that can guide strategic investment to prevent OUD and inform implementation of MAT programs to increase patient adherence. This proposal comprises a 5-year plan that includes mentorship by Wade Berrettini, MD, PhD, Brian Schwartz, MD, MS, H. Lester Kirchner, PhD, MS, Danielle Mowery, PhD, MS, and Alanna Kulchak Rahm, PhD, MS; didactic training activities to meet the candidate's training goals; and conduct of a two-phase research project that will provide the candidate with substantive experience leading epidemiologic research using electronic health record (EHR) data and in implementation science. The proposed research will be conducted at Geisinger, an integrated healthcare system serving a large geographically diverse region of Pennsylvania, leveraging its research assets—including a wealth of health-related EHR data and linked genetic data—and the ability to integrate research into the clinical environment. The aims of the research are twofold. Aim 1 centers on the social determinants that engender vulnerability to OUD, evaluating associations of community contextual factors related to socioeconomic, social, and physical conditions with OUD, and the role individual-level genetic risk factors, healthcare factors, and comorbid medical conditions play in these relations. Aim 1 will utilize EHR and genetic data from Geisinger patients (n = 18,728) coupled with secondary data characterizing community factors to conduct a nested case-control study. Aim 2 seeks to understand program implementation factors that impact patient adherence to MAT for OUD. Aim 2 is a mixed methods study that will involve interviews with key informants (n ≈ 30) to identify multilevel barriers and facilitators influencing MAT success, followed by a survey of adult patients (n = 500) in Geisinger's MAT clinics to quantify factors influencing MAT adherence from a patient perspective. Completion of this research will fulfill the candidate's short-term goals by providing training in: (1) OUD, its treatment, and substance use disorder research; (2) natural language processing; (3) measurement of contextual factors; (4) statistical analysis including multilevel modeling and mediation analysis; (5) gene-environment interaction research; and (6) implementation science. The proposed research will generate evidence to understand novel, understudied risk factors for OUD, with implications for investment in community-level prevention interventions, and how health systems can improve treatment retention among individuals with OUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research will elucidate how community contextual factors related to economic, social, and physical conditions work in conjunction with individual-level genetic risk factors, healthcare factors, and comorbid medical conditions in generating or mitigating risk for opioid use disorder. It will also identify program implementation factors at the individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels that influence adherence to medication-assisted treatment among patients with opioid use disorder. The research results will inform investment in preventive interventions where community conditions may increase risk for opioid use disorder as well as how health systems can increase retention in treatment programs for opioid use disorder.",Understanding the role of community determinants in opioid use disorder and program implementation factors influencing patient adherence to opioid agonist therapy,10054517,K01DA049903,"['Abate', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adult', 'Buprenorphine', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'County', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dropout', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'PF4 Gene', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Qualitative Research', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biobank', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'case control', 'community intervention', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'contextual factors', 'deprivation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'health data', 'illicit opioid', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid treatment program', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'rural counties', 'scale up', 'skills', 'social', 'social cohesion', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment program']",NIDA,GEISINGER CLINIC,K01,2020,162032,0.07757907458219739
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices.

"Enhancing Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research to Address the Opioid Epidemic PROJECT SUMMARY Up-to-date information about non-fatal overdose emergency department (ED) encounters can provide critical information about the evolution of the opioid epidemic and response of the healthcare system and is an essential to planning of clinical trials to address the problems underlying this epidemic. Establishing a platform that delivers high positive predictive value for opioid-related overdose (OD) using a combination of coded and natural language terms in electronic health records (EHRs) is an essential step toward the large-scale surveillance necessary to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of numerous systemic and policy-based efforts and to create the infrastructure for large scale trials to reduce drug-related mortality and morbidity. However, to date, localized and federal efforts have been largely based on discrete ICD-10 code data or have had time lags of one-to-three years for more detailed data. Perhaps more Importantly, they have not had the capacity for planning and feasibility assessment for clinical and translational research at specific sites. We propose foundational work to create an inter-institutional research database and network focused on patients presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD. To create this network, we will extend previous work to develop: (1) an e-phenotype for case identification in the ED based on EHR data, and (2) combine this with a data dictionary and coded data extraction tools, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, to obtain additional data from EHRs; tools for primary capture of data during clinical care; and tools for integration of data on social determinants of health. This will allow for a more thorough characterization of individuals presenting to EDs with opioid-related OD including: demographics, comorbidities, OD agent and source, intentionality of the OD, ED treatment and discharge disposition. Through refinement and automation, the data extraction process will be extended to a set of pilot CTSA Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network sites and then potentially to other CTSA's nation-wide. This new functionality focuses on providing a platform to accelerate research. To accomplish this work, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Demonstrate the feasibility of extending the ACT Network data model and infrastructure to monitor the opioid epidemic using ED data, 2) Create a prototype opioid overdose monitoring and response network across participating institutions and a toolkit for other CTSA sites to join the network, and 3) Demonstrate potential usefulness of the network in monitoring the opioid epidemic and in planning clinical trials. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective near real time means of monitoring opioid-related OD presentation in EDs across the country to inform point-of-care service delivery, prevention and treatment intervention development and evaluation. Downstream, the application of project deliverables include dissemination of the replication toolkit to leverage the platform of the CTSAs and NIDA Clinical Trials Network to build capacity for timely surveillance of opioid-related OD to facilitate prevention and treatment research and intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients presenting with opioid-related overdose to hospital emergency departments represent a high-risk group for morbidity and mortality and a potential target for interventions to combat the opioid epidemic. This proposal is innovative as it aims to develop a feasible and effective inter-institutional research database and network focused on these patients.

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10009334,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2020,229404,0.06885549320890899
"Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults Abstract Falls and fall-related injuries are significant public health issues for adults 65 years of age and older. Over a third of older adults (OA) fall each year and 10-20% of falls result in serious injuries such as fractures and head trauma. The annual direct medical costs in the US as a result of falls are estimated to exceed $50 billion, and this estimate does not include the indirect costs of disability, dependence, and decreased quality of life. This project targets community dwelling OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are socially vulnerable. MCI is a leading risk factor for falls in OA. Approximately 15%-20% of OA have MCI, and over 60% of OA with MCI fall annually – two to three times the rate of those without cognitive impairment. Socially vulnerable OA living in low-resource neighborhoods with poor housing conditions have twice the risk of falling. We have developed an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. The purpose of this study is to refine the Sense4Safety intervention based on extensive feedback by low income OA with MCI, their family members or trusted others and clinicians in order to ensure that the passive monitoring system to predict fall risk for OA with MCI can generate actionable and tailored information that can be used effectively by these stakeholder groups.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study.

"Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression PROJECT SUMMARY We have identified a novel property of the cervical spinal cord that modulates respiratory activity, both the rate and depth of breathing, such that the respiratory drive in opioid-suppressed states in mice and humans increases during spinal cord epidural stimulation. Respiratory rates are increased upon epidural stimulation of specific cervical spinal cord locations when there is spontaneous breathing, and rhythmic breathing can be generated when the respiratory state is depressed and spontaneous breathing is absent. This is an important observation because the brainstem, which contains the rhythm-generating center for respiration, is a difficult area for surgical and therapeutic access. If there are other accessible neural regions by surgery (i.e. epidural stimulation) or non-invasive means (i.e. transcutaneous stimulation), for example in the cervical spine, that influence respiration or contain their own rhythmic respiratory elements, these may represent potential therapeutic targets to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. Thus, we have proposed a strategy to characterize this novel cervical respiratory circuit. First, we will conduct extensive electrical mapping of the respiratory responsive elements of the cervical spinal cord in mice aided by machine learning strategies, and we will characterize the mechanistic basis for this response, the relation to opioid receptors to the respiratory response, and identity neurons responsible for the respiratory response using optogenetic techniques. Guided by the animal studies, we will then confirm the cervical respiratory responsive loci in humans. Third, we will subject the identified respiratory competent regions to increasing doses of opioid to further characterize the dose-response profile of these regions. Fourth, we will assess the feasibility and practical translation of this strategy to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression in three patients implanted with spinal cord stimulators. These studies will provide an anatomical and electrophysiological characterization of the respiratory circuit within the cervical spine and provide practical information for the treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression. The results obtained, especially because they are obtained in humans, will have an immediate translational impact on our understanding of the respiratory circuit that may, in turn, prevent deaths due to opioid overdose. PROJECT NARRATIVE Opioid overdose often leads to death due to suppression of respiration; therefore, strategies to prevent respiratory depression in addition to treatment of opioid addiction are necessary to prevent deaths in the opioid-use epidemic. Respiratory suppression occurs because neurons in the brain that drive breathing are inhibited (turned off) by narcotics; thus, understanding the neural pathways for breathing will allow us to devise effective neuromodulatory strategies to treat opioid-induced respiratory depression. We have proposed to characterize a novel breathing circuit that, when activated by stimulation of the cervical spine, has the potential to be an effective treatment of opioid-induced respiratory depression, and it is our hope that findings from these studies may lead to new and more effective treatments for respiratory depression secondary to opioid overdoses.",Characterization of Novel Neural Respiratory Circuit to Counter Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression,9884080,R01DA047637,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cervical', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Cervical spine', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Coughing', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Drug Implants', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Monitor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Naloxone', 'Narcotics', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Respiration', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Respiratory Center', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strenuous Exercise', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'Vital Statistics', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mu opioid receptors', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'optogenetics', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'transcutaneous stimulation', 'translational approach', 'translational impact', 'ventilation']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,701059,0.014738260518722918
"Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) PROJECT SUMMARY Analgesics are among the most commonly prescribed medications, and opioid painkillers are the gold standard for the management of severe acute pain, and for many chronic pain conditions. More than 30% of the U.S. population suffers from chronic pain, and nearly 40% of older adults report debilitating chronic pain conditions not caused by cancer. However, side effects of opioids, including tolerance, physical dependence, and respiratory depression have limited their effectiveness as pain killers. Rates of addiction and opioid overdose have escalated to a point of crisis. In the United States, on average approximately 115 people die every day from accidental overdose. Better, efficacious and safe opioid analgesic drugs with reduced risk of use are urgently needed. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) – an integrated knowledgebase aimed at accelerating and improving the success of translational research and drug discovery programs towards the identification of efficacious and save opioid drugs. ODO will enable multi-tiered analyses across diverse data types and hypothesis development for example by connecting chemical structure, biochemical binding profiles, pharmacological responses in animals and drug side effects and thus enable more effective rational drug discovery programs. To develop ODO we will leverage our extensive previous work in several research consortia developing formal ontologies, data standards, processing and integration methods, and software systems to enable integrated access, query and analysis of large scale and diverse data types. The current proposal aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the ODO integrated knowledgebase and illustrate proof of concept via two Specific Aims: (1) to curate and harmonize ODO content from diverse data sources via a semantic knowledge model enabling integration of diverse data types, and (2) to deploy the ODO integrated Data Portal and Search Engine engaging the community and demonstrate its heuristic value. We envision that the ODO will pave the way to enable advanced machine learning and link results from molecular simulations with opioid analgesic drug pharmacology and functional selectivity, thus facilitating, at larger scale, the rational, predictive design, and scaffold optimization in drug development efforts towards identifying safer opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pain is the number one reason people seek medical attention. Although narcotic pain killers are effective, they are highly addictive and have severe side effects. Doctors need better opioid drugs to treat moderate to severe pain. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO), the first public opioid drug knowledgebase with the capability to use machine learning tools to help scientists design new drugs to treat pain without harmful side effects.",Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO),9895053,R21DA048313,"['Acute Pain', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Analgesics', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'FAIR principles', 'Failure', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Narcotics', 'Network-based', 'Neuropharmacology', 'Ontology', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Opioid Receptor Binding', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Dependence', 'Population', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Publications', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'clinical pain', 'cloud based', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data harmonization', 'data portal', 'data standards', 'design', 'diverse data', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'journal article', 'knowledge base', 'medical attention', 'mu opioid receptors', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'search engine', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'software systems', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,230250,-0.08957534075172868
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,9952335,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'physically handicapped', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,756872,0.10587706311493332

In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,10169552,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'physically handicapped', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,174599,0.10587706311493332
"Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial PROJECT SUMMARY Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic, new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate resource targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of magnitude of future overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. Next, we will conduct a randomized policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns in Rhode Island. Within these cities/town, the health department will work with stakeholders to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/town will continue to receive these interventions, but without targeting to specific neighborhoods. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions. To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool, which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest risk of opioid-related death. This results study will significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States.","Reducing Drug-Related Mortality Using Predictive Analytics: A Randomized, Statewide, Community Intervention Trial",10026087,R01DA046620,"['Academic Detailing', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'American', 'Area', 'Buprenorphine', 'Censuses', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Community Trial', 'Intervention Trial', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methadone', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Naloxone', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neighborhoods', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research Priority', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid policy', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'peer', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'referral services', 'resource guides', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment arm']",NIDA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,654124,0.11576768430895913
"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,9883766,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'empowered', 'first responder', 'health goals', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,464512,0.12008959521475139

"Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media 2/12/2019 ProjectSummary - Google Docs Project Summary I will leverage social media conversations, specifically Reddit, to examine treatment help-seeking at an unprecedented scale, thereby collecting evidence “in the wild” as a new strategy to monitor and respond to the opioid crisis through the following aims. Aim 1. Data Driven Characterization of Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users: I will systematically identify Reddit posts about opioids, identify if the post is help-seeking for treatment, and contextualize the content of help-seeking posts. Aim 2. Data Driven Characterization of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to understand how peers organically respond to help-seeking for treatment by building data-driven models to discern what attributes of posts are predictive of receiving a response from a peer and to examine the typical content and reciprocity of responses. Aim 3. Assess the Quality of Lay Responses to Help-Seeking from Self-Identified Opioid Users: I aim to identify the types of treatment, treatment services, and treatment referral services that are provided in the responses and assess the quality of lay responses to opioid treatment help-seeking. Currently, little is known about how drug users engage social media to support or combat their addictions. Reddit is the sixth most popular website in the US with many reporters noting that it may be the last lifeline for opioid users. Yet, little has been done to tap this potential source for social media monitoring, especially given the difficulty of finding self-identified opioid users who are already contemplating strategies to treat their addiction. This study adds a new significant perspective to social media monitoring and will be among the first in public health to consider social media conversation threads by assessing unique posts about opioid help-seeking, the responses these posts get, and the quality of responses to addiction help-seeking, thereby creating a knowledge base for public health leaders to respond. Success of these aims will generate a number of future research directions that will support interventions that address the needs of self-identified opioid users seeking help on Reddit. Moreover, within all three aims this study will bring significant methodological advances to the study of social media around substance use with the aims relying heavily on automated approaches and analysis first developed in the computational sciences engendering more data scientists to join public health to create actionable knowledge. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4XHd63xhPZT8OFf9bHQ2q6XHpYp_c4AbouAOtAC3SU/edit 1/1 2/12/2019 ProjectNarrative - Google Docs Project Narrative An explosion of surveillance tools fueled by big media data (including social media) is changing public health. These data reveal what a person is thinking/doing and when they are thinking/doing it based on the content and timing of their public posts, providing an assessment of organic help-seeking for addiction and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing that was never before possible. I will extract actionable intelligence from social media data, specifically Reddit, to support more agile, responsive opioid intervention research by studying (a) treatment help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, (b) lay responses to help-seeking of self-identified opioid users, and (c) whether lay peers link self-identified opioid users to evidence-based treatment, treatment services, or treatment referral services. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RyIXTdDAbFSkCe81q6hThDiZzKGCXkCy8npWgzr5wfM/edit 1/1",Quantifying Treatment Help-Seeking Among Self-Identified Opioid Users on Social Media,9872029,K25DA049944,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Code', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Drug user', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Hotlines', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Opioid', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Public Assistance', 'Public Health', 'RQ2', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Social intelligence', 'Source', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'combat', 'dissemination trial', 'evidence base', 'help-seeking behavior', 'illicit opioid', 'knowledge base', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'opioid user', 'opioid withdrawal', 'peer', 'phrases', 'posters', 'prescription opioid', 'public health intervention', 'referral services', 'research study', 'response', 'social media', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K25,2020,189498,0.020026989496594132
"AI-powered social entrepreneurship training and community-opportunities matching platform for women enrolled in drug treatment programs. The Opioid drug crisis in US increases at an alarming rate with 68% of the more than 70,200 drug overdose deaths in 2017 involved an opioid, averaging 130 Americans dying every day from opioid overdose (CDC, 2013). Remarkably, between 1999 and 2010, overdose deaths from prescription painkillers increased more than 400% among women, astonishing 1.7 times higher than that of men; and heroin use among women between 2002 and 2013 increased 100%, 2 times higher than among men (CDC, 2013). There is a call for gender-focused drug abuse interventions (OWH, 2016; NIH, 2018). Adverse social conditions, including economic insecurity, have been identified as risk factors for opioid use among women and reasons for relapse. Addressing addiction problems in conjunction with vocational rehabilitation and, specifically, entrepreneurial skills training has been suggested (SAMHSA, 2000). Furthermore, a good behavioral strategy should include community involvement, as it helps to maintain successful addictive behavioral change (NDCI, 2014). Unfortunately, only a handful of recovery centers offer entrepreneurial skills training and help women to engage in volunteer work or offer them employment opportunities, due to the lack of financial and human resources (SAHMSA, 2000). ​The objective of this Phase I grant application is to establish technical and commercial feasibility of Gooddler AI-powered, online social entrepreneurship training platform that aims to provide recovery centers with a cost-effective option that will address entrepreneurial skills training and match women with open job or volunteer opportunities at local non-profit organizations.​ To accomplish this objective, we plan to execute the following specific aims: 1) demonstrate commercial feasibility of Gooddler social entrepreneurship training curriculum with three recovery centers in San Francisco Bay Area; and 2) demonstrate the technical feasibility of Gooddler platform to match women in recovery with appropriate volunteering and/job opportunities at local non-profit organizations. We will establish the technical feasibility by developing community-opportunities matching model that will address the specifications of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The commercial feasibility will be demonstrated by helping women to gain skills and knowledge for meaningful engagement (job, volunteering, entrepreneurship). Success will move us closer to our long-term goal of providing drug recovery centers with a tool to help 430,000 women, entering US drug treatment programs every year, to get on the path of productive social involvement in communities of their choice. Gooddler, Inc. proposes to develop and validate an AI-powered social entrepreneurship training and community-opportunities matching platform, targeting 430,000 women in US enrolled in drug treatment programs annually, to give them the necessary knowledge and skills to ensure a productive social involvement in chosen communities after they complete the treatment. Our highly experienced team will be able to successfully execute the project in this $100M market and expand the offering to other settings. It can be easily adapted to be included in programs for incarcerated women, extended to be offered to men and/or to be offered as a stand-alone vocational skills training course.",AI-powered social entrepreneurship training and community-opportunities matching platform for women enrolled in drug treatment programs.,9985318,R43DA051061,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'American', 'Analgesics', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Budgets', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Drug Rehabilitation Centers', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human Resources', 'Imprisonment', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Occupations', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Conditions', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vocational rehabilitation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'community involvement', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'heroin use', 'men', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'overdose death', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'social engagement', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'volunteer']",NIDA,"GOODDLER, INC",R43,2020,225000,0.004436844194196386
"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids.

"Real-time fMRI neurofeedback of large-scale network dynamics in opioid use disorder PROJECT SUMMARY The misuse of opioids, opioid addiction and overdose are a serious national public health crisis—the opioid epidemic—that despite increased scientific, clinical and government attention, continues to grow. Methadone is a generally effective treatment for opioid use disorder, however relapse rates remain high, and risk of overdose is greatest during relapse. There is a need for improved mechanistic understanding of the factors that contribute to opioid relapse to improve our understanding of opioid use disorder and its treatment. Using connectome-based methods (i.e., functional connectivity) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we recently identified a large-scale brain network that predicted opioid relapse from both resting and task states. Connectome-based methods enable data-driven characterization of whole brain networks related to behavior that might be better suited to describe complex clinical phenomena (e.g., opioid relapse). Building on prior work indicating the utility of real-time fMRI neurofeedback to test brain activation patterns related to specific functions and individual abilities to regulate these functions, the proposed project will use connectome-based neurofeedback to target patterns of functional connectivity within our recently identified “opioid abstinence network”. This information is critical to improve understanding of mechanisms of opioid relapse. Individuals on methadone will be randomized to receive either active (n=12) or sham (n=12) connectome-based neurofeedback at 3 weekly scanning sessions including feedback and transfer runs. Additional baseline and follow-up scans will include resting state and reward and cognitive task runs. Craving, negative affect and opioid use will be measured weekly and at 1-mo follow-up. Based on our pilot data, connectome-based feedback will be targeted at the opioid abstinence network and we hypothesize that increased connectivity in this network will be associated with improved clinical outcomes. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with reduced opioid use from baseline to follow-up scans (Aim 1a) and at 1-mo follow- up (Aim 1b). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with increased opioid abstinence network connectivity in resting state (Aim 2a) and task (reward, cognitive) state (Aim 2b) versus sham feedback, as in our pilot work. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that active feedback is associated with greater improvements in clinical features of opioid use disorder (craving, negative affect) than sham feedback (Aim 3a) and that increased opioid abstinence network connectivity will correlate with these improvements (Aim 3b). Overall, this project tests a potentially transformative hypothesis relating large-scale brain network dynamics to outcomes in opioid use disorder, and tests a highly innovative method for real-time fMRI neurofeedback from the opioid abstinence network to improve clinical features of opioid use disorder. This project will provide unprecedented insight into the functional neurobiology of opioid relapse and more generally has the potential to transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project leverages advances in real-time fMRI neurofeedback and machine learning to test whether methadone-treated individuals with opioid use disorder can increase functional connectivity within an empirically-derived “opioid abstinence network” that has previously been identified to predict opioid relapse. This project will provide critical data and information to improve our understanding of opioid relapse and may transform existing real-time fMRI paradigms in addictions more generally. Findings should contribute to the scientific and clinical response to the growing opioid epidemic and be used to inform treatment development.",Real-time fMRI neurofeedback of large-scale network dynamics in opioid use disorder,10025590,R21DA049583,"['Abstinence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Government', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'connectome', 'craving', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methadone treatment', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurofeedback', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose risk', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,209375,0.1622724755683075
"Non-Invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation in Patients with Opioid Use Disorders Treatment of Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) includes medications with effects on opioid receptors such as buprenorphine, but access is limited for many patients and others are opposed to treating addictions with medications that have opioid agonist properties. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that is more acceptable for many patients, and recent studies show it to be equivalent in efficacy. Initiation of treatment with long-acting naltrexone, however, requires a period of abstinence of about seven days during which time patients suffer from intense symptoms of withdrawal with a risk of relapse that can lead to overdose-related death. Opioids have an inhibitory effect on norepinephrine and the sympathetic nervous system, and many symptoms of withdrawal are driven by rebound activation of these systems. Dopaminergic systems in brain areas including ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) and medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate) play an important role in opioid addiction, craving and relapse, as do increases in inflammation. This project will assess a form of neuromodulation involving non-invasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve that may play a useful role during the period of opioid withdrawal before the initiation of long-term naltrexone treatment in blocking norepinephrine, sympathetic, and inflammatory responses and enhancing peripheral parasympathetic and central brain function in areas modulating drug craving (ventral striatum, anterior cingulate). Our preliminary data on the effects of non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) on stress response in traumatized human subjects and patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show that nVNS reliably blocks peripheral sympathetic and enhances parasympathetic function, reduces inflammatory responses (interleukin-6, or IL-6), and enhances central brain responses (anterior cingulate) to stress. We now propose to apply this technology to the treatment of patients with OUDs. Following verification using modelling and determination of optimal dosing parameters, we will use these parameters to assess effects of nVNS versus sham stimulation on opioid craving, peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and brain functional responses measured with High-Resolution Positron Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabeled water to videos of drug cues in recently treated patients with OUDs. Based on the outcome of this research, we will proceed to the UH3 phase, which will involve a randomized, sham-controlled trial of nVNS in patients with OUDs during the one to two week period of opioid withdrawal followed by assessment of craving, HR-PET imaging of both brain function and brain dopaminergic function, and assessment of peripheral autonomic, cardiovascular and inflammatory responses in conjunction with administration of nVNS or sham. We hypothesize that nVNS will reduce opioid craving and inflammatory, peripheral autonomic and cardiovascular responses and enhance brain responses (anterior cingulate function and dopamine function in ventral striatum), and promote successful conversion to long-acting naltrexone, in patients with OUDs. Opioid use disorders (OUDs) have been associated with a 4-fold increase in drug overdose deaths in the past decade, and current treatments including medications that block the opioid receptor require a withdrawal period during which time many patients relapse and tragically may overdose and die. This project will assess a new device, non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (nVNS), that does not require surgery or implantation, and that electrically stimulates the vagus nerve as it passes through the neck, dampening the sympathetic nervous system and modulating brain regions in a way that may help patients during the opioid withdrawal period and reduce relapse. Studying the effects of nVNS on opioid craving and brain and physiological responses in patients with OUDs has the potential to reduce relapse and save lives, as well as increase our knowledge of changes to the brain and physiology that underlie OUDs and successful response to treatment.",Non-Invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation in Patients with Opioid Use Disorders,9983431,UG3DA048502,"['Abstinence', 'Adverse reactions', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Dose', 'Drug usage', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Family', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Imagery', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Naltrexone', 'Neck', 'Nerve', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Radiolabeled', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Validation', 'Vasomotor', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'craving', 'drug craving', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'neuroregulation', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid withdrawal', 'overdose death', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'tomography', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'vasoconstriction']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,UG3,2020,739505,0.13933216711552338
