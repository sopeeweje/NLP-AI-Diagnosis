"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth. The project expects to create models that can identify patients at risk for pneumonia based on information in their medical record so that those risks may be recognized and reduced.",Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings,9784789,R03DE027020,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental Records', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Periodontitis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'pneumonia model', 'portability', 'secondary analysis', 'systems research', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia']",NIDCR,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R03,2019,159914,0.019786318045169355
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9701324,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,613809,-0.01828418997089489
"Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache ABSTRACT There is currently no recognized way of accurately predicting who will recover from post-traumatic headache (PTH) during the acute phase following concussion and who will go on to develop persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH), a condition that is difficult to treat effectively. Clinical experience with treating secondary headaches suggests that treatment is most effective when initiated early after headache onset, before headache patterns become persistent. So, why don't clinicians treat all patients with PTH acutely following concussion? Although it is likely to be beneficial to treat those patients who are at high risk for PPTH as early as possible, medication side effects and toxicities make it potentially harmful to administer unnecessary medication to those patients who would recover on their own without treatment. The inability to identify which concussed patients with acute PTH are at high risk for PTH persistence leaves clinicians without the knowledge needed to make informed decisions regarding how aggressive to manage patients with acute PTH. Study Goal: to develop a prognostic biomarker signature for PPTH using clinical data as well as structural and functional brain neuroimaging and to assess the predictive accuracy of an ensemble biomarker signature for the early identification of patients at high risk for PTH persistence. The accurate prediction of individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence would allow clinicians to recommend early and more aggressive management with the intention of preventing PTH persistence. A predictive model for PPTH could also guide clinical trials that will test the utility of innovative therapies to prevent PPTH by allowing for enrichment of the subject cohort with patients at high risk of PPTH. R61 Phase: During the R61 phase this study will develop brain imaging and clinical feature prognostic biomarker signatures for PPTH using machine-learning algorithms. The imaging and clinical biomarker signatures will be developed by laboratories that will first work in-parallel, and then the laboratories will combine the neuroimaging and clinical biomarkers using an ensemble approach. Results of this study will determine important clinical factors (e.g. demographics, medical history, brain injury characteristics, headache characteristics, speech patterns) and brain imaging markers (e.g. regional volumes, cortical thickness, white matter tract integrity, perfusion, functional connectivity) for predicting PTH persistence Additionally, the predictive weight of specific clinical factors and neuroimaging features for characterizing patients who are at higher risk for developing PPTH will be determined. R33 Phase: Once the predictive weights of clinical factors and neuroimaging features are determined, the clinical testing battery and neuroimaging sequences can be pruned down and optimized to include only those that have high predictive power for PPTH. The scanning sequences used in this study are commonly available MRI sequences, making their use feasible across healthcare centers. This optimized and shortened testing sequence can be translated into clinical practice and integrated into PTH clinical trials for early identification of those individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence.   Project Narrative: Currently, there are no adequate methods to predict whether an individual with post-traumatic headache (PTH) will have resolution of headaches during the acute phase or will have persistence of PTH (PPTH). The goal of this study is to identify a prognostic biomarker signature that will accurately predict the persistence of PTH using clinical data and structural and functional brain neuroimaging data collected in the semi-acute post-concussion phase. The ability to predict who will develop PPTH would help clinicians determine how aggressively to manage patients with PTH during the acute phase and would allow for optimizing enrollment into PTH clinical trials by preferentially enrolling individuals who are likely to have PTH persistence.  ",Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache,9829475,R61NS113315,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Headache', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Headaches', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'demographics', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'side effect', 'white matter']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R61,2019,3152333,0.010821807475138712
"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9656869,F31CA221061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tweens', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2019,39107,0.004608083685554956
"Learning radiomic signatures to early predict response of rectal cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy Abstract Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common newly diagnosed cancer and the 3rd most common cause of cancer death among US men and women. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer. Preoperative CRT has clearly improved rates of local disease control and colostomy free survival; however the response to therapy is heterogeneous. It would be very useful to be able to predict the individual risk of each patient, so that their therapy can be personalized. The goal of our study is to derive clinically useful radiomic signatures from multimodal imaging data for the early prediction of treatment outcomes in rectal cancer patients. Central to our methodology are 1) an improved deep learning model for automatically segmenting tumors from multimodal imaging data with high accuracy; and 2) a multi-task deep learning model for robustly learning informative radiomic features to predict survival and recurrence. These methods will be used to derive individualized predictive indices of treatment outcomes based on a multimodal imaging dataset of rectal cancer patients who have received preoperative CRT. Our methods are generally applicable to radiomic studies of cancer patients. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader radiomics community. Project Narrative This project will develop multimodal imaging data analytic tools for the early prediction of treatment outcomes in rectal cancer patients who have received preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.",Learning radiomic signatures to early predict response of rectal cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy,9619051,R21CA223358,"['Address', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colostomy Procedure', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Excision', 'Fascia', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hemoglobin', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mesorectal', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nodal', 'Noise', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Rectal Neoplasms', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Sphincter', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Total Mesorectal Excision', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'chemoradiation', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disorder control', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'multimodal data', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'partial response', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'radiomics', 'rectal', 'response', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,169834,0.03887610780436137
"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration. These features are not well recapitulated by the current biomarkers in use in the clinic, majority of them are DNA based mutation assays. RNA expression patterns have been described by various investigators and may more fully recapitulate tumor biology. The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay. By utilizing an assay developed to classify CRC by its tumor biology, we anticipate development of an enduring tool that will be of greater use than traditional fit-for-purpose tests.   NARRATIVE The molecular characteristics of colon cancer can be described by RNA-based expression, and a consensus classification method has been developed.

"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites.

"Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer Abstract Head and neck cancers are the fifth most common cancer type in the United States, with an overall survival rate lower than 50%. Although the incidence of other sub-sites of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in past decades, the number of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) cases has increased significantly. Most OPSCC patients receive standard cancer therapy.4 However, the clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Predicting early in treatment whether a tumor is likely to respond to treatment is one of the most difficult yet important tasks in providing individualized cancer care.  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known driving oncogenic factor in oropharyngeal cancer, as well as a significant prognostic biomarker for patient survival. Retrospective studies conducted by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium (INHANCE) have demonstrated that clinical biomarkers have prognostic value in helping stratify OPSCC patients into groups with differing risks of death or disease progression. However, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients have similar rates of metastatic spread to HPV-negative patients. The same is true for patient groups stratified with other clinical biomarkers. More robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for optimally effective treatment.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Multiple studies indicate that miRNAs are promising cancer biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in oropharyngeal cancer. Imaging features extracted from medical images are an exciting new class of cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habitats. For several tumor sites, imaging biomarkers have shown promise in accurately separating favorable and unfavorable prognosis patients. However, current efforts to utilize high-dimensional multimodal biomarkers for treatment outcome prediction have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; feature redundancy, heterogeneity, and uncertainty; and patient cohorts with unbalanced outcomes. The correlation, independence, and complementary nature of multimodal biomarkers (imaging, miRNA, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers) remains unexplored as well.  The major goal of this research is to develop a multimodal biomarker-based model that can reliably predict subsets of OPSCC patients with low and high risks for treatment failure. The model will serve as a clinical decision-making tool. Specifically, we propose a novel principle and systematic machine learning-based strategy to effectively identify and seamlessly combine prognostic information carried by multimodal biomarkers. Aim 1: Identify prognostic multimodal biomarkers, given OPSCC patient data. Aim 2: Develop and test a comprehensive multimodal biomarker-based model for predicting OPSCC treatment outcomes. Aim 3: Assess the clinical benefit of the model for OPSCC patient stratification and individualized treatment. Narrative The achievement of this project forms a basis of combining non-invasive imaging biomarkers with miRNAs, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers for accurate cancer prognosis and discovering the correlation with genetic mechanisms leading to specific tumor phenotypes. This clinical decision-making tool can provide useful information to support patient stratification and individualized treatment. We anticipate that many of the methodological improvements established in this proposal will improve oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treatment and tumor response assessment and treatment in other disease sites as well.",Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer,9818602,R01CA233873,"['Achievement', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2019,419721,0.029457442759851016
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9776502,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'web portal', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,400000,0.03595975520651943
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9720681,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,161230,0.06635719788822761
"Personalized Digital Behavior Change Interventions to Promote Oral Health Although preventable, dental disease is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States and exacts a substantial personal and societal toll. It is closely linked to low oral health literacy and poor oral hygiene behaviors (OHBs). Using the high prevalence and burden of dental disease as a proxy, there is a large gap between knowledge about quality oral hygiene routines and what is practiced by individuals. The causes are many but ultimately distill down to a systemic failure to communicate oral hygiene instructions (OHIs) effectively or to engage and motivate patients in their own oral self-care.  To address the know-do gap, we begin by distilling desired brushing behaviors into a simple 2x2x4 OHI (brushing 2 times a day, for 2 minutes each time, all 4 dental quadrants). We will leverage tracking capabilities of our innovative eBrush platform to remotely monitor tooth-brushing activities in home settings. Using the 2x2x4 OHI and eBrush as foundational elements, we will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of personalized Digital Oral Health Interventions (DOHI) for promoting ideal OHBs in at-risk individuals. In the UG3 phase, we will build out the technologic infrastructure for collecting brushing data and delivering the DOHI. Then, we will engage target end-users in the co-design of an app for oral self-care and establish the usability and feasibility of the system. In the UH3 phase, we will build and validate computational models to infer the quality of OHBs from brushing data and personalize the DOHI. Using a cohort of 130, we will conduct a 10-week Micro-Randomized Trial to optimize the adaptive tailoring of engagement strategies. Finally, we will evaluate effectiveness of the computationally-driven, adaptive DOHI in promoting sustained engagement in the 2x2x4 OHB. We hypothesize that a dynamic and personalized DOHI will be more effective than traditional, static, clinician-delivered OHI in improving oral health and adherence to 2x2x4 OHBs. We will test our hypothesis through a 6-month, pragmatic, randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Eligible adults from safety-net dental clinics will be equipped with an electronic toothbrush and the smartphone app for tracking brushing data. After a run-in period (4 weeks) to ensure technical proficiency and establish baseline OHBs, 260 at-risk subjects will receive a clinician-delivered 2x2x4 OHI and randomized to either: (a) an intervention arm where subjects receive ongoing, personalized DOHIs at opportune times; or (b) a control arm where subjects lack such feedback. Subjects will be followed for 20 weeks. Trained dental examiners will conduct assessments at each visit (baseline, randomization and after 20 weeks). Primary outcomes are changes in dental health from baseline (Modified Gingival Index and Plaque Index). Secondary outcome is the quality of adherence to the 2x2x4 OHI. We will explore subject-level features that predict the magnitude of response to the DOHI. Our team science approach presents a potentially paradigm shifting opportunity to leverage the growing ubiquity and reach of digital technologies to activate, educate, and engage patients in optimal oral health self-care in ways and at a scale previously unimaginable. 3c.

"Low-Cost and Compact Multimodal Intraoral Confocal Probe for Oral Cancer Detection and Diagnosis Abstract Oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) together rank as the sixth most common cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 400,000 new cases each year. The 5-year survival rate in the U.S. for OSCC is 62%, the survival rate is only 10-40% and the cure rate around 30% in the developing world. Low survival rate is primarily attributed to the delay in diagnosis and the resultant progression of disease to an advanced stage at diagnosis. Early diagnosis offers the best chance to improved treatment outcomes and survival for an individual diagnosed with OSCC. The objective of this proposed project focuses on developing and evaluating a low-cost, compact, smartphone compatible multimodal intraoral confocal probe for noninvasive in situ detection of oral dysplasia and early stage cancer. The key innovation of the proposed intraoral confocal probe is low-cost and compact confocal intraoral probe using actively addressable point source array - microLED (µLED) without any moving parts to achieve 3D confocal imaging. The wide-FOV autofluorescence imaging (AFI) and polarized white light imaging (pWLI) will identify the suspicious regions with the help of trained neural network and guide confocal scan to obtain tissue microstructure for accurate diagnosis. We will achieve this objective through the following two Aims: (1) develop multimodal confocal imaging probe with µLED array and (2) evaluate the performance and clinical feasibility of multimodal intraoral probe. The proposed project has a great significance. The compact, multimodal handheld intraoral imaging probe, in conjunction with the deep learning image classification method, will enable noninvasive in situ early detection and diagnosis of oral dysplasia and cancer from benign conditions in a clinical setting, significantly reducing disease progression, reducing death rates from oral cancer and improving the quality of life. The cost-effective, smartphone compatible design is extremely suitable for screening oral cancer through remote diagnosis in low- resource setting, significantly improve the survive rate of oral cancers in low- and middle- income countries. Early detection of oral cancer is the effective method for improving both the survival rate and the quality of the lives of the patients.

"Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting Project Summary/Abstract Background and Candidate: Children with orofacial clefting present with increased rate of dental anomalies in shape, size, number, symmetry, abnormal eruption and malposition of teeth both inside and outside the cleft area, leading to dental problems and reduction of quality of life. Although the scientific community has recognized these findings for a long time, the specific etiological factors underlying such anomalies still remain elusive. An important step to understanding etiology is via careful phenotypic approaches that can detect the co-occurrence of such anomalies in discernable patterns that can simplify the identification of risk factors. Dr. Brian Howe is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the College of Dentistry of the University of Iowa. His primary research focus is on the identification and characterization of oral phenotypes in an effort to identify etiological factors underlying the oral phenotypic spectrum of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting. Career Goals: Dr. Howe's short term goals are to deepen is knowledge of complex craniofacial phenotypes and expand his current understanding of craniofacial development. His long term goals are to become a funded independent researcher and a leading clinician and educator in the field of craniofacial phenomics and dentistry as a tenure track faculty at a University of Iowa. His research plan is innovative in that it leverages unique bioinformatics algorithms to identify complex oral phenotypic patterns amenable for studies of risk factors and causality. Environment: The University of Iowa has an established reputation for the successful training of graduate and postdoctoral students in research and clinical areas. It offers learning and development seminars focused on career development and advancement with particular benefits from training opportunities from its Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). Career Development Plan: Dr. Howe is committed to attend courses, tutorials, seminars and relevant conferences as well as meeting regularly with his mentors, collaborators, and advisory committee to fulfill is training aims and gain the knowledge necessary to achieve his future research goals and become an independent clinical researcher. Research Study: This research aims to identify oral phenotypic patterns in orofacial clefting using modern and traditional pattern mining methods in a diverse international population with existing environmental and genetic variables. This knowledge will have key implications in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting as well as driving the implementation of innovative treatment approaches to improve dental outcomes and future preventive strategies. Project Narrative  Individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefting present with a wide range of dental anomalies leading to more intricate oral rehabilitation procedures which increases dental morbidity and reduces quality of life in those affected. In the largest international cohort of families with orofacial clefting and controls to date, this project will utilize pattern mining approaches to detect the co-occurrence of particular dental anomalies in discernable patterns that will likely simplify the search for the etiological factors underlying these anomalies. This research will aid in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting by expanding and further defining oral phenotypes which will drive biologically meaningful strategies for the identification of genetic risk factors as well as helping to improve clinical care.",Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting,9743788,K08DE028012,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Enamel', 'Dental crowns', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maxilla', 'Mentors', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Odontogenesis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pierre Robin Syndrome', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Dentition', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth Germ', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vascular blood supply', 'analytical tool', 'calcification', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'college', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial complex', 'craniofacial development', 'design', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'novel', 'orofacial cleft', 'palatogenesis', 'permanent tooth', 'phenomics', 'professor', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'trend']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2019,12553,0.04040074812649834
"Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia The American Cancer Society estimates that 48,330 new cases of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx will be reported this year. When diagnosed at early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83%. However, when diagnosed at intermediate or advance stages, the 5-year survival rate drops to 62% and 38%, respectively. In addition, while early stage treatment may only require minor surgery to remove the localized tumor, later stage treatment could require surgical removal of parts of the face and neck, hence drastically reducing the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, benign oral lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or early invasive cancer even for healthcare professionals. As a result, only 31% of patients are diagnosed at early stages despite the fact that the oral cavity is easily accessible for direct examination. Hence, there is a critical need for new clinical technologies for reliable early diagnosis of oral cancer and dysplasia. Several screening tools for oral cancer have been commercially available, including exfoliative cytology, vital staining, salivary test, and optical interrogation; however, none of them have been demonstrated to be capable of clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that several biomarkers for oral cancer and dysplasia can be accurately quantified by endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) thus enabling levels of sensitivity and specificity adequate for early detection. This bioengineering research grant focuses on developing and validating a cost-effective wide-field multispectral FLIM endoscope for noninvasive in situ detection of oral cancer and dysplasia. To that end we have developed three specific aims. Aim 1: To design and build a cost-effective multispectral FLIM endoscope for in vivo imaging of epithelial tissue in the oral cavity. Aim 2: To develop algorithms for fast and automated FLIM based early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. Aim 3: To quantify prospectively in a pilot clinical study the capability of the proposed FLIM endoscopic tools for noninvasively early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. The successful completion of these aims will result in a novel, accurate and cost-effective clinical tool for noninvasive in situ early detection of cancer and dysplasia. Such a tool could potentially help to improve significantly both the life expectancy and the quality of life for the more than 33,000 oral cancer patients being diagnosed each year at intermediate and advance stages. Beyond early diagnosis, this tool could also assist at every step involved on the clinical management of oral cancer patients, including treatment guidance and monitoring of disease recurrence. Finally, the demonstrated success of this clinical tool in oral epithelial cancer will herald future success with other cancers of epithelial origin, which accounts for more than 80% of all cancers. Early detection of both new and recurrent oral cancer holds great promise for improving both the survival rate and the quality of live of these patients. The proposed work is to develop a clinical tool capable of quantifying noninvasively different biomarkers associated to oral epithelial cancer progression and detecting early stage oral cancer and dysplasia. Such tool will revolutionize oral epithelial cancer management by allowing not only early screening and diagnosis, but also treatment guidance and monitoring for disease recurrence.",Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia,9920692,R01CA218739,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Coenzymes', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Epithelial', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Situ', 'Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mild Dysplasia', 'Minor Surgical Procedures', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring for Recurrence', 'Neck', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Oral Stage', 'Oral cavity', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Salivary', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'early screening', 'exfoliative cytology', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'oral dysplasia', 'oral lesion', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2019,499903,0.08711997626802313
"DR. EPS: Drug Repurposing for Extended Patient Survival Project Summary Human cancers are complex diseases that present vast heterogeneity, leading to widely different survival outcomes. Thus actionable and robust predictive models for cancer prognosis are much needed for more personalized treatment and disease management. However, There has been severely lacking of therapeutically actionable computational methods, which explicitly model patient survival difference as the objective while integrating multi-dimension high-throughput genomics data. To solve this issue, we propose a novel actionable framework for caner drug repurposing, called DR. EPS (Drug Repurposing for Extended Patient Survival). Towards this goal, we will develop the following strategies: (1) Constructing and validating a new class of hybrid-learning based, multi-omics prognosis modeling approach, using seven diverse liver cancer population cohorts. (2) Developing and experimentally validating an actionable computational drug- repurposing framework to improve the survival of high-risk liver cancer patients, using big sets of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics data. (3) Building a user-friendly webtool that accelerates such bench-to-bed transition for liver cancer treatment. We expect that this project will be groundbreaking in many aspects, including building new prognostic models on multi-omics data sets, identifying new repurposed drugs to extend high-risk liver cancer patient life-spans, and providing a first-hand drug reposition resource for liver cancer therapeutics research community. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop an actionable drug-repurposing framework, in order to extend the survival time of high-risk liver cancer patients.

"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,9614864,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,394948,-0.012491674970861247
"Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings Project Summary (Abstract) With little change in incidence for over 50 years, pneumonia remains the top cause for morbid hospitalization1 in the USA, and is associated with healthcare costs exceeding $10 billion annually2. This study proposes to mine big data captured in an intergrated medical/dental record (iEHR) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) of a large midwestern medical-dental integrated healthcare system and will test the hypothesis that poor oral health is an independent risk for subtypes of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Proposed specific aims include: 1) electronic identification and characterization of pneumonia types and 2) evaluation of the association of oral health status with risk of pneumonia. Tasks to achieve study aims are to: a) develop electronic, phenotype-based algorithm(s) to classify and characterize pneumonia by subtype and relative frequency of events; b) characterize impact of immediate and longitudinal oral health status on emergent pneumonia stratified by subtype; and c) evaluate relative risk contributed by medical and dental factors. Innovative application of natural language processing (NLP) to support evaluation of unstructured data and machine learning (ML) to identify as-yet unknown potential risk factors is proposed. These aims will be accomplished by established investigators including dentists and researchers with extensive research track records in oral and systemic health including pneumonia, clinical pulmonologist/intensivist to provide clinical expertise to inform data mining, biomedical informaticians with expertise in data mining, ML and NLP and data modeling, and experienced biostatisticians who will apply appropriate statistical approaches and traditional data modeling to big data. This team will collaboratively create and deliver a unique, well-defined, pneumonia- specific, oral health data registry resource and validated phenotype-based algorithm to classify pneumonia, stratified by subtypes, which will support future interrogation for additional permutations of medical and dental factors. Study outcomes are expected to leverage immediate translational value within the health system with high potential for relevance and portability to other settings. The project is expected to define risk factors which may represent actionable targets for reduction of pneumonia risk across various settings. Project Narrative- Relevance to public health: Pneumonia continues as a leading public health problem in hospitals, healthcare facilities and community settings. Pneumonia is the top disease-related cause for hospitalization. This study proposes to use data in electronic health records to classify pneumonia type and describe risk factors that may make individual susceptible to different types of pneumonia, including impact of diseases of the mouth, gums and teeth. The project expects to create models that can identify patients at risk for pneumonia based on information in their medical record so that those risks may be recognized and reduced.",Secondary Analysis of EHR Data to Examine Relative Impact of Oral Health History on Incident Pneumonia by Settings,9599192,R03DE027020,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Aspiration Pneumonia', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental Records', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nosocomial pneumonia', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Periodontitis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumonia', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outreach', 'patient population', 'patient screening', 'pneumonia model', 'portability', 'secondary analysis', 'systems research', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia']",NIDCR,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R03,2018,174917,0.019786318045169355
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9534747,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,663541,-0.01828418997089489
"Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Classification of a patient’s cancer is critical for personalizing their therapy, and in many cases involves the pathologic examination of tissues treated with multiple immunohistochemical stains. This process is highly subjective, leading to problems with reliable classification and suboptimal treatment and this proposal is focused on developing software tools to improve the reliability of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. These tools will provide a reliable means of interpreting information derived from a practice known as immunohistochemistry to improve the consistency of diagnosis and patient outcomes.",Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,9507539,U01CA220401,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cations', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer survival', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'dashboard', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'health management', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interactive tool', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplasm resource', 'oncology', 'open source', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,467872,0.0347001291112059
"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration. These features are not well recapitulated by the current biomarkers in use in the clinic, majority of them are DNA based mutation assays. RNA expression patterns have been described by various investigators and may more fully recapitulate tumor biology. The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay. By utilizing an assay developed to classify CRC by its tumor biology, we anticipate development of an enduring tool that will be of greater use than traditional fit-for-purpose tests.   NARRATIVE The molecular characteristics of colon cancer can be described by RNA-based expression, and a consensus classification method has been developed.

"A Novel, Patient-Centered Prognostic Tool for Adults with Critical Illness Project Summary/Abstract:  A growing number of older adults in the United States who are near the end of life are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with acute critical illness and receive invasive medical treatments. The use of prolonged life-sustaining treatments such as mechanical ventilation for older adults near death is common and increasing over time. However, most older adults report end-of-life care preferences to prioritize their comfort and quality of life near death over burdensome life-sustaining treatments. To make medical treatment decisions that are aligned with end-of-life-care preferences, patients and their surrogates require meaningful prognostic information in the setting of an acute illness. However, traditional prognostic tools for critically ill patients have focused on estimating patients' risk of death. Patients and surrogates often struggle to interpret or use mortality estimates for decision making, and the dichotomous outcome of mortality fails to describe the longitudinal trajectory of a patient's illness. We hypothesize that a novel tool that incorporates longitudinal prognostic information and a more descriptive account of potential outcomes will help patients, surrogates, and ICU physicians make treatment decisions that are aligned with end-of-life care preferences.  The central goals of this NRSA Individual Fellowship are to (1) facilitate the candidate's career development into an independent, successful health services researcher in critical care medicine and (2) address the disparity between end-of-life medical care that is delivered in the United States and patients' goals values, and preferences. The candidate and her mentors have designed a training plan to accomplish these goals that includes two specific research objectives. First, we aim to create a novel, longitudinal predictive model for critically ill adults that characterizes the expected trajectory of medical treatments over time and a description of the patient's likely outcome. To accomplish our first objective, we will apply the innovative tools of predictive analytics from the field of engineering (i.e. robust machine learning) to a large EHR-derived clinical database of all admissions to an adult medical ICU over 3 years (N ≈ 3,000 patients). The predictive model will characterize discrete, temporal patterns of patients' exposure to medical treatments during an ICU stay (“illness trajectories”) and describe the outcomes of patients who follow each trajectory. Second, we plan to use the output of our predictive model to design a user-centered prognostic tool for clinical use. Using both real and hypothetical output from our predictive model, we will engage critically ill patients (if able to participate), their surrogate decision-makers, and critical care clinicians to design and iteratively revise a prognostic tool that presents longitudinal data. The stakeholders will participate in qualitative interviews and focus groups to provide feedback about the content, format, and usability of the tool for treatment decisions in the ICU. This study will lead to the prototype of a novel, patient-centered prognostic tool that is designed to better align treatment decisions in the ICU with patients' end-of-life care preferences. Project Narrative Many critically ill patients and their families are confronted with a decision between life-prolonging but burdensome treatments or comfort-focused medical care that may lead to an earlier death. These decisions can be very difficult when there is uncertainty about whether the patient can recover and what the patient's life will be like during the illness and recovery. To help with these difficult decisions, we propose a study to design a new tool to help patients, families, and ICU clinicians predict the range of possible outcomes for an individual patient.","A Novel, Patient-Centered Prognostic Tool for Adults with Critical Illness",9467697,F32HL140824,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Interviews', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Sampling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'care preference', 'career', 'career development', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional status', 'human old age (65+)', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient oriented', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prototype', 'skills', 'surrogate decision maker', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F32,2018,59886,0.006092866908196248
"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9470767,F31CA221061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tweens', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2018,38615,0.004608083685554956
"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites.

"Learning radiomic signatures to early predict response of rectal cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy Abstract Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common newly diagnosed cancer and the 3rd most common cause of cancer death among US men and women. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer. Preoperative CRT has clearly improved rates of local disease control and colostomy free survival; however the response to therapy is heterogeneous. It would be very useful to be able to predict the individual risk of each patient, so that their therapy can be personalized. The goal of our study is to derive clinically useful radiomic signatures from multimodal imaging data for the early prediction of treatment outcomes in rectal cancer patients. Central to our methodology are 1) an improved deep learning model for automatically segmenting tumors from multimodal imaging data with high accuracy; and 2) a multi-task deep learning model for robustly learning informative radiomic features to predict survival and recurrence. These methods will be used to derive individualized predictive indices of treatment outcomes based on a multimodal imaging dataset of rectal cancer patients who have received preoperative CRT. Our methods are generally applicable to radiomic studies of cancer patients. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader radiomics community.

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response.

"Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia The American Cancer Society estimates that 48,330 new cases of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx will be reported this year. When diagnosed at early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83%. However, when diagnosed at intermediate or advance stages, the 5-year survival rate drops to 62% and 38%, respectively. In addition, while early stage treatment may only require minor surgery to remove the localized tumor, later stage treatment could require surgical removal of parts of the face and neck, hence drastically reducing the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, benign oral lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or early invasive cancer even for healthcare professionals. As a result, only 31% of patients are diagnosed at early stages despite the fact that the oral cavity is easily accessible for direct examination. Hence, there is a critical need for new clinical technologies for reliable early diagnosis of oral cancer and dysplasia. Several screening tools for oral cancer have been commercially available, including exfoliative cytology, vital staining, salivary test, and optical interrogation; however, none of them have been demonstrated to be capable of clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that several biomarkers for oral cancer and dysplasia can be accurately quantified by endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) thus enabling levels of sensitivity and specificity adequate for early detection. This bioengineering research grant focuses on developing and validating a cost-effective wide-field multispectral FLIM endoscope for noninvasive in situ detection of oral cancer and dysplasia. To that end we have developed three specific aims. Aim 1: To design and build a cost-effective multispectral FLIM endoscope for in vivo imaging of epithelial tissue in the oral cavity. Aim 2: To develop algorithms for fast and automated FLIM based early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. Aim 3: To quantify prospectively in a pilot clinical study the capability of the proposed FLIM endoscopic tools for noninvasively early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. The successful completion of these aims will result in a novel, accurate and cost-effective clinical tool for noninvasive in situ early detection of cancer and dysplasia. Such a tool could potentially help to improve significantly both the life expectancy and the quality of life for the more than 33,000 oral cancer patients being diagnosed each year at intermediate and advance stages. Beyond early diagnosis, this tool could also assist at every step involved on the clinical management of oral cancer patients, including treatment guidance and monitoring of disease recurrence. Finally, the demonstrated success of this clinical tool in oral epithelial cancer will herald future success with other cancers of epithelial origin, which accounts for more than 80% of all cancers. Early detection of both new and recurrent oral cancer holds great promise for improving both the survival rate and the quality of live of these patients. The proposed work is to develop a clinical tool capable of quantifying noninvasively different biomarkers associated to oral epithelial cancer progression and detecting early stage oral cancer and dysplasia. Such tool will revolutionize oral epithelial cancer management by allowing not only early screening and diagnosis, but also treatment guidance and monitoring for disease recurrence.",Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia,9470668,R01CA218739,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Coenzymes', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Epithelial', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Situ', 'Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mild Dysplasia', 'Minor Surgical Procedures', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring for Recurrence', 'Neck', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Oral Stage', 'Oral cavity', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Salivary', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'early screening', 'exfoliative cytology', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'oral dysplasia', 'oral lesion', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2018,162511,0.08711997626802313
"Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting Project Summary/Abstract Background and Candidate: Children with orofacial clefting present with increased rate of dental anomalies in shape, size, number, symmetry, abnormal eruption and malposition of teeth both inside and outside the cleft area, leading to dental problems and reduction of quality of life. Although the scientific community has recognized these findings for a long time, the specific etiological factors underlying such anomalies still remain elusive. An important step to understanding etiology is via careful phenotypic approaches that can detect the co-occurrence of such anomalies in discernable patterns that can simplify the identification of risk factors. Dr. Brian Howe is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the College of Dentistry of the University of Iowa. His primary research focus is on the identification and characterization of oral phenotypes in an effort to identify etiological factors underlying the oral phenotypic spectrum of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting. Career Goals: Dr. Howe's short term goals are to deepen is knowledge of complex craniofacial phenotypes and expand his current understanding of craniofacial development. His long term goals are to become a funded independent researcher and a leading clinician and educator in the field of craniofacial phenomics and dentistry as a tenure track faculty at a University of Iowa. His research plan is innovative in that it leverages unique bioinformatics algorithms to identify complex oral phenotypic patterns amenable for studies of risk factors and causality. Environment: The University of Iowa has an established reputation for the successful training of graduate and postdoctoral students in research and clinical areas. It offers learning and development seminars focused on career development and advancement with particular benefits from training opportunities from its Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). Career Development Plan: Dr. Howe is committed to attend courses, tutorials, seminars and relevant conferences as well as meeting regularly with his mentors, collaborators, and advisory committee to fulfill is training aims and gain the knowledge necessary to achieve his future research goals and become an independent clinical researcher. Research Study: This research aims to identify oral phenotypic patterns in orofacial clefting using modern and traditional pattern mining methods in a diverse international population with existing environmental and genetic variables. This knowledge will have key implications in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting as well as driving the implementation of innovative treatment approaches to improve dental outcomes and future preventive strategies. Project Narrative  Individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefting present with a wide range of dental anomalies leading to more intricate oral rehabilitation procedures which increases dental morbidity and reduces quality of life in those affected. In the largest international cohort of families with orofacial clefting and controls to date, this project will utilize pattern mining approaches to detect the co-occurrence of particular dental anomalies in discernable patterns that will likely simplify the search for the etiological factors underlying these anomalies. This research will aid in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting by expanding and further defining oral phenotypes which will drive biologically meaningful strategies for the identification of genetic risk factors as well as helping to improve clinical care.",Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting,9582428,K08DE028012,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Enamel', 'Dental crowns', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maxilla', 'Mentors', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Odontogenesis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Dentition', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robin bird', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth Germ', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vascular blood supply', 'analytical tool', 'calcification', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'college', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial complex', 'craniofacial development', 'design', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'orofacial cleft', 'palatogenesis', 'permanent tooth', 'phenomics', 'professor', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'trend']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2018,150636,0.04040074812649834
"Development and feasibility of prevention-minded oral health mobile App based on dietary selections and oral hygiene events. The number of decayed and filled tooth surfaces in primary dentition is on the rise in US children between the ages of 2 and 11 years old; in fact, 60% of adolescents (between 12 and 19 years old) and 9 out of 10 dentate seniors (age 65+) bear evidence of dental caries. Reinforced with a 2011-12 report stating 91% of those between the ages of 20 and 64 have dental caries, virtually all walks of life are thus affected – and this doesn’t even include those unreported, or those with significant dental erosion or gingival recession. Thus, these statistics could imply there is a significant unmet need in creating improved mechanisms for healthier dietary and hygienic habits. One way to achieve healthier habits and behavior is through effective communication. However, disconnects exist between oral health messaging and the patient’s understanding of clinical recommendations: in fact, oral health organizations recognize the need to improve and empower the public’s oral health literacy. Although adherence to preventive plans are critical to thwarting tooth decay, a patient’s poor oral health understanding and knowledge, even after a dental visit, persistently introduce factors that diminish preventive efforts and favorable oral health outcomes: for example, a clinical report revealed the average patient only recounts about half of the recommended dental advice. Oral health literacy is a relatively new area of research and there are few innovations in this space. Therefore, opportunities that address oral health illiteracy and behavioral barriers utilizing today’s 21st century technology may promote better oral health outcomes. Such approaches are already well-under way for systemic health, but thus far, prevention-minded oral health measures are lacking. We believe a unique approach exists that utilizes something most people, both young and old, access on a daily basis: a mobile device. Our approach is underlined by recent statistics released by the Pew Center: more than 8 out of 10 U.S. adults access mobile devices for information, including more than 67% of seniors (65+ years of age). Utilizing our proven strengths and successes in preventive dentistry innovations and mobile application (App) development, in this Phase I proposal we will determine feasibility of creating a prototype oral health App that scores dietary and oral hygiene events utilizing algorithms devised from libraries of empirical nutritional and scientific data (laboratory and clinical). In doing so, this Phase I proposal has three Specific Aims: empirical nutritional and scientific data mining; multi-tiered decision tree algorithm construction with putative scoring index based on Aim #1 data; and, development of a prototype mobile App based on Aims #1 and #2. If successful and with clinical testing expected in a Phase II proposal, the long-term goal of this research is to deploy and commercialize an oral health App that promotes clinically effective oral health behavior. The constant feed from mined data libraries and social-engineering aspects are expected to drive routine use of the App, thus engaging the user towards favorable habits and healthier outcomes.

"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9383530,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,666777,-0.01828418997089489
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9381186,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,362188,0.06635719788822761
"Practical Prognostics Project Summary/Abstract (Walker WC; Practical Prognostics) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a very heterogeneous anatomical and physiological condition with extremely variable outcomes. For survivors of higher TBI severity grades, functional recovery is usually incomplete and protracted, and can range from total dependence to full recovery. While this offers hope for specific individuals, it also creates enormous uncertainty in prognosis. Facing this uncertain future, patients and their families desperately want and need meaningful prognostic information. Unfortunately, the extensive TBI outcomes literature has largely failed to inform clinical prognosis, and predicting long- term functional outcome remains particularly challenging. For TBI severities greater than mild, the standard clinical prognosis given is “time will tell” or “we honestly don't know.” Clearly, better clinically relevant prognostic models are needed. This study will analyze clinical data from survivors of closed TBI enrolled in multi-center database (NIDILRR TBI Model Systems; N>14,000) and develop a set of user-friendly prognostic tools for 1, 2, and 5 year functional outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale and employment). Models will be built using classification tree methodology that permits multiway splits, a more robust way of estimation compared to the few past TBI studies using decision tree methods. First, TBI severity will be stratified by post-traumatic amnesia duration, then select clinical variables (injury, health, and demographic) will be entered. The result will be a set of prognostic tools that will empower providers to give meaningful prognostic information to survivors and their families. It will also help set rehabilitation expectations and serve as a basis for preliminary rehabilitative treatment planning. Using the information found in the models, several post-injury modifiable conditions will also be assessed to find patient groups at risk for having poorer outcomes from these conditions and potential candidates for targeted therapy. The specific aims of our proposed study are as follows: 1. Build the decision tree prognostic models for long-term GOS and employment outcomes 2. Assess their generalizability in large, independent datasets from TBI-MS and [exploratory aim] patients  in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI II database. 3. Using the classifications of outcomes from the previous method, assess how modifiable conditions  (depression, anxiety, substance misuse, emotional problems) are related to the outcomes after adjusting  for the demographic and baseline injury characteristics using the predictions from the prognostic tool. Project Narrative (Walker WC; Practical Prognostics) Individuals who survive traumatic brain injury (TBI) face a very uncertain future, with a wide variation in potential functional outcomes ranging from total dependence to full recovery. The main purpose of this study is to develop a set of prognostic tools that is tailored to the individual patient and will give better long-term forecasts on chances for returning to independent living and work. It will also assess several conditions that are common after TBI, such as depression and anxiety, and measure their impact on outcome in order to find high risk groups who may need targeted therapy.",Practical Prognostics,9324730,R21HD089097,"['Algorithms', 'Amnesia', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Models', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Emotional', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Injuries', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Care', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persistent Vegetative State', 'Physiological', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Walkers', 'Work', 'base', 'care systems', 'caregiving', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk population', 'individual patient', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'substance misuse', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'user-friendly']",NICHD,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,228750,0.0370914952330702
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment.

"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013).     This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr. Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr. Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr. John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.     During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies.     The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project. Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data. These advances will lead to the development of improved diagnostics for patients, allowing clinicians to more accurately predict the outcome of a patient's disease, leading to more effective individualized therapies.",INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY,9109050,K22LM011931,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Israel', 'K22 Award', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical care', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning community', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical schools', 'microscopic imaging', 'model building', 'multitask', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'programs', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptomics', 'translational medicine', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NLM,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K22,2016,153528,0.044712793011958935

"Naltrexone Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this international pilot study we use data from four clinical trials of heroin dependence treatment to identify which patients will be better respondents to naltrexone treatment and among respondents which type of naltrexone formulation (oral, implantable, or injectable) leads to the best outcome. Although in the United States naltrexone has been FDA approved for treatment of opioid addiction it has been underutilized. In Russia (where substitution therapy is illegal), naltrexone is the only pharmacological treatment option. Naltrexone is available in three forms: oral and extended release, injectable, and implantable depot-formulations. A novel methodology (Model-based Random Forest, mobForest) (Garge et al. 2013) will be extended to heroin treatment and to the development of a single interpretable parsimonious model. These methods will be applied to combined data from past four naltrexone efficacy randomized double blind, double dummy, placebo- controlled clinical trials and identify which patients are likely to respond to different naltrexone formulations. These studies were conducted in St. Petersburg, Russia, have data on almost 1,000 patients with more than 400 individual-level variables spanning demographics, clinical, genetic, and psychometrics domains. We will develop validated predictive models that provide prognosis of patients' response.

"Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. These designations of natural history assume great importance at a time when insights from preclinical studies are beginning to translate into therapies targeted at specific key pathways of fibrosis. Stratification of disease phenotypes is important in order to decipher the effects of newly approved therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individual patients.  Various prognostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with overall survival; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good early predictive models exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF from multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier on scans annotated manually by an expert radiologist, analyzing in separate aims static image features present on baseline scans and transitional (difference) morphologic features on sequential scans that herald progressive disease. Features of anatomic distribution will be explored and reproducible imaging features will be expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score. Aggregate prognostic models using Cox proportional regression models will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Finally, we will externally validate our models in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitia Lung Disease Program.  Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that anticipate disease course in patients with IPF. We anticipate that these models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions for the choice in treatment as well as future research to define more homogeneous cohorts for testing new safe and effective therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rates of progression are highly variable, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using newer drug therapies.

"The oral microbiome and enterosalivary circulation of nitric oxide in HIV. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic HIV is associated with increased risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications. Despite use of antiretroviral therapy, rates of even rare vascular complications such as pulmonary hypertension occur upwards of 25 times that in HIV- individuals. The cause for such a high rate of vascular complications in HIV is unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) is a critically important signaling molecule that is produced by the vascular endothelium and acts as a vasodilator and regulator of cardiovascular health. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. The enterosalivary NO pathway is an important component of nitric oxide generation as nitrate is converted to nitrite by a series of bacterial enzymes in the mouth, which is then swallowed and either directly converted to NO or absorbed into the bloodstream where it exerts systemic NO-like effects. The enterosalivary NO pathway depends on viable populations of oral bacteria and helps regulate blood pressure and mitigate vascular injury. However, little is known about the specific bacterial populations involved or the contribution to systemic NO availability and vascular injury and disease. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIV+ individuals have a different profile of oral commensal bacteria (oral microbiome) than HIV- individuals that involves key nitrate reduction pathways. This study proposes the novel hypothesis that the accelerated cardio- and pulmonary vascular disease seen in HIV is due in part to changes in the oral microbiome that favor a disruption of the enterosalivary NO pathway, reduced NO availability, and chronic vascular injury. To test this hypothesis, the oral microbiome of an established cohort of 315 HIV+ and HIV- participants will be characterized using culture-independent sequencing techniques in banked oral wash samples. Expression of specific bacterial nitrate-reducing enzymes will be measured, and results correlated with available serological markers of vascular damage, echocardiographic testing, and radiographic measures of vascular injury. Results will directly inform future clinical enrollment of a prospective trial examining real-time nitrate metabolism, systemic NO distribution, and associated physiological effects. These investigations will offer the first stepsin understanding a novel pathway of HIV-associated vascular disease and inform development of targeted therapies. Additionally, this NRSA award will provide the candidate, a pulmonary medicine fellow, the opportunity for further training in pulmonary vascular medicine and for developing skills in HIV/AIDS and microbiome research. The candidate will acquire extensive training in basic and advanced laboratory techniques, biostatistics, and clinical study design through labwork, conferences, and a master's degree in clinical/translational research. The resources and experience of mentors Dr. Morris, an expert in HIV-related lung disease and the microbiome, and Dr. Gladwin, an expert in NO and pulmonary vascular disease, combined with the expansive array of resources available at the University of Pittsburgh, will support the candidate's successful development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular diseases remain a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals in the current era of effective antiretroviral therapy. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. Normal populations of bacteria that live in the mouth are key in maintaining adequate levels of nitric oxide and thus important in vascular function, but these key bacteria may be altered in those with HIV and contribute to excess pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular risk. This proposal will determine changes in the oral microbiome in HIV, the impact of these changes on nitrate reduction pathways, and relationship to markers of vascular function.            ",The oral microbiome and enterosalivary circulation of nitric oxide in HIV.,9103887,F32HL128165,"['3-nitrotyrosine', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Antioxidants', 'Arginine', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bioavailable', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Enrollment', 'Enzymes', 'Exhibits', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'IL6 gene', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'N,N-dimethylarginine', 'N-terminal', 'NBL1 gene', 'NOS3 gene', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nitrate Reductases', 'Nitrates', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Nitrite Reductase', 'Nitrites', 'Nitrogen', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'Pulmonology', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal DNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salts', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serological', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Source', 'Stomach', 'Stress', 'Stretching', 'Supplementation', 'Taxon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'cohort', 'commensal microbes', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immune activation', 'improved', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'nitrogen metabolism', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oral bacteria', 'oral commensal', 'oral microbiome', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'pyrosequencing', 'reconstruction', 'serological marker', 'skills', 'stem', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2016,70854,-0.01573866342046283
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9185800,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Shipping', 'Ships', 'Software Tools', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'design', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'web portal', 'white matter change']",NIBIB,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2016,400000,0.03595975520651943
"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013).     This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr. Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr. Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr. John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.     During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies.     The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project. Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data. These advances will lead to the development of improved diagnostics for patients, allowing clinicians to more accurately predict the outcome of a patient's disease, leading to more effective individualized therapies.",INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY,8887236,K22LM011931,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Israel', 'K22 Award', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical care', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical schools', 'model building', 'multitask', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'transcriptomics', 'translational medicine']",NLM,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K22,2015,151992,0.044712793011958935
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary It is estimated that there will be about 12,340 new cases of cervical cancer and those 4,030 women will die of this disease this year in the United States (American Cancer Society). Worldwide, invasive cervical cancer is an even greater problem and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. A method to accurately predict cervical cancer outcome prior to standard therapy would be critical for the early identification of patients with high risk of treatment failures. For these high-risk patients modified therapy could potentially be applied for improved patient survival. However, traditional clinic pathologic features, such as tumor grade and stage, have limited prognostic values in cervical cancer. Thus, new methods need to be developed for improved prognostic performance. In this proposed research, we will test the hypothesis that the expression signature of multiple selected microRNAs can reliably predict the outcome of cervical cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered family of small non- coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers to predict cancer therapy outcomes. However, the prognostic value of miRNAs in cervical cancer has not been investigated. The major goal of this research is to build a miRNA-based model to robustly predict cervical cancer outcome. Our preliminary analysis has identified two miRNAs that are predictive of cervical cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all cervix-related miRNAs in a large number of cervical tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of cervical cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, leading to about 300,000 deaths each year. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized cervical cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non- coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER,8827726,R21CA177902,"['American Cancer Society', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cervix Neoplasms', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'public health relevance', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,165844,0.03511654331787671

"Naltrexone Treatment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this international pilot study we use data from four clinical trials of heroin dependence treatment to identify which patients will be better respondents to naltrexone treatment and among respondents which type of naltrexone formulation (oral, implantable, or injectable) leads to the best outcome. Although in the United States naltrexone has been FDA approved for treatment of opioid addiction it has been underutilized. In Russia (where substitution therapy is illegal), naltrexone is the only pharmacological treatment option. Naltrexone is available in three forms: oral and extended release, injectable, and implantable depot-formulations. A novel methodology (Model-based Random Forest, mobForest) (Garge et al. 2013) will be extended to heroin treatment and to the development of a single interpretable parsimonious model. These methods will be applied to combined data from past four naltrexone efficacy randomized double blind, double dummy, placebo- controlled clinical trials and identify which patients are likely to respond to different naltrexone formulations.

"The oral microbiome and enterosalivary circulation of nitric oxide in HIV. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic HIV is associated with increased risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications. Despite use of antiretroviral therapy, rates of even rare vascular complications such as pulmonary hypertension occur upwards of 25 times that in HIV- individuals. The cause for such a high rate of vascular complications in HIV is unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) is a critically important signaling molecule that is produced by the vascular endothelium and acts as a vasodilator and regulator of cardiovascular health. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. The enterosalivary NO pathway is an important component of nitric oxide generation as nitrate is converted to nitrite by a series of bacterial enzymes in the mouth, which is then swallowed and either directly converted to NO or absorbed into the bloodstream where it exerts systemic NO-like effects. The enterosalivary NO pathway depends on viable populations of oral bacteria and helps regulate blood pressure and mitigate vascular injury. However, little is known about the specific bacterial populations involved or the contribution to systemic NO availability and vascular injury and disease. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIV+ individuals have a different profile of oral commensal bacteria (oral microbiome) than HIV- individuals that involves key nitrate reduction pathways. This study proposes the novel hypothesis that the accelerated cardio- and pulmonary vascular disease seen in HIV is due in part to changes in the oral microbiome that favor a disruption of the enterosalivary NO pathway, reduced NO availability, and chronic vascular injury. To test this hypothesis, the oral microbiome of an established cohort of 315 HIV+ and HIV- participants will be characterized using culture-independent sequencing techniques in banked oral wash samples. Expression of specific bacterial nitrate-reducing enzymes will be measured, and results correlated with available serological markers of vascular damage, echocardiographic testing, and radiographic measures of vascular injury. Results will directly inform future clinical enrollment of a prospective trial examining real-time nitrate metabolism, systemic NO distribution, and associated physiological effects. These investigations will offer the first stepsin understanding a novel pathway of HIV-associated vascular disease and inform development of targeted therapies. Additionally, this NRSA award will provide the candidate, a pulmonary medicine fellow, the opportunity for further training in pulmonary vascular medicine and for developing skills in HIV/AIDS and microbiome research. The candidate will acquire extensive training in basic and advanced laboratory techniques, biostatistics, and clinical study design through labwork, conferences, and a master's degree in clinical/translational research. The resources and experience of mentors Dr. Morris, an expert in HIV-related lung disease and the microbiome, and Dr. Gladwin, an expert in NO and pulmonary vascular disease, combined with the expansive array of resources available at the University of Pittsburgh, will support the candidate's successful development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular diseases remain a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals in the current era of effective antiretroviral therapy. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. Normal populations of bacteria that live in the mouth are key in maintaining adequate levels of nitric oxide and thus important in vascular function, but these key bacteria may be altered in those with HIV and contribute to excess pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular risk. This proposal will determine changes in the oral microbiome in HIV, the impact of these changes on nitrate reduction pathways, and relationship to markers of vascular function.            ",The oral microbiome and enterosalivary circulation of nitric oxide in HIV.,8924325,F32HL128165,"['3-nitrotyrosine', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Antioxidants', 'Arginine', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bioavailable', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Enrollment', 'Enzymes', 'Exhibits', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'IL6 gene', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'N,N-dimethylarginine', 'N-terminal', 'NBL1 gene', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nitrate Reductases', 'Nitrates', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Nitrite Reductase', 'Nitrites', 'Nitrogen', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'Pulmonology', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal DNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salts', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serological', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Source', 'Stomach', 'Stress', 'Stretching', 'Supplementation', 'Taxon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'cohort', 'commensal microbes', 'experience', 'high risk', 'human NOS3 protein', 'immune activation', 'improved', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'nitrate reductase', 'nitrogen metabolism', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oral bacteria', 'oral commensal', 'oral microbiome', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'pyrosequencing', 'reconstruction', 'serological marker', 'skills', 'stem', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2015,66566,-0.01573866342046283
"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY  Abstract The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013). This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies. The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project.  Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data. These advances will lead to the development of improved diagnostics for patients, allowing clinicians to more accurately predict the outcome of a patient's disease, leading to more effective individualized therapies.",INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY,8674406,K22LM011931,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Israel', 'K22 Award', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical care', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical schools', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'transcriptomics', 'translational medicine']",NLM,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K22,2014,170586,0.044712793011958935
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary It is estimated that there will be about 12,340 new cases of cervical cancer and those 4,030 women will die of this disease this year in the United States (American Cancer Society). Worldwide, invasive cervical cancer is an even greater problem and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. A method to accurately predict cervical cancer outcome prior to standard therapy would be critical for the early identification of patients with high risk of treatment failures. For these high-risk patients modified therapy could potentially be applied for improved patient survival. However, traditional clinic pathologic features, such as tumor grade and stage, have limited prognostic values in cervical cancer. Thus, new methods need to be developed for improved prognostic performance. In this proposed research, we will test the hypothesis that the expression signature of multiple selected microRNAs can reliably predict the outcome of cervical cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered family of small non- coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers to predict cancer therapy outcomes. However, the prognostic value of miRNAs in cervical cancer has not been investigated. The major goal of this research is to build a miRNA-based model to robustly predict cervical cancer outcome. Our preliminary analysis has identified two miRNAs that are predictive of cervical cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all cervix-related miRNAs in a large number of cervical tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of cervical cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, leading to about 300,000 deaths each year. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized cervical cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non- coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.            ",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER,8690410,R21CA177902,"['American Cancer Society', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cervix Neoplasms', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198849,0.03511654331787671
"Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of adult hematopoietic malignancy. It has a high rate of disease relapse, a consequence of chemoresistance. Recent biological studies suggest that a major component of the relapse phenotype resides in a rare population of leukemic stem cells (LSC), characterized by extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential, and poor response to standard chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesize that i) common molecular characteristics inherent to LSC-enriched populations reflect the biology of heterogeneous AML with unfavorable prognostic features; ii) these associations can be derived from systematic analysis of gene and microRNA expression profiles, and other biologic characteristics of bulk AML samples. The overarching goal of this project is to define LSC-characterized transcription factor (TF) and microRNA interactions in heterogeneous AMLs. We proposed to integrate both qualified data-driven and curated knowledge about LSC characteristics, and clinical outcomes from bulk AML. Specifically, we will perform meta-analyses on a pathway level to build LSC-specific biology, focusing on AML prognostic TF/microRNA deregulation. These approaches are supported by our two pioneering mathematical methodologies: the Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression (FAIME) and the mechanism-anchored Phenotypes-Genotype Network (PGNet). FAIME provides a novel process for transforming extensive available gene expression profiles into individual pathway profiles, resulting in more reproducible pathway signatures (46% overlap among three cohorts, empirical p<0.001). The PGNet method reveals genes regulated by disease-critical regulators and can accurately predict patient outcomes - shifting the paradigm from single gene/microRNA analysis towards ""mechanism anchored profiling"". Using PGNet, we have successfully predicted that the epigenetic regulator HDAC9 is associated with survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Innovatively, this project will interrogate microRNAs/genes that regulate LSC-specific biological pathways and AML prognostication, integrating regulator-regulator interactions and regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 1, we will build LSC-specific gene pathways and identify regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 2, we will correlate LSC-specific regulators and their target genes corresponding to AML outcomes. In Aim 3, we will develop novel approaches to computationally model the crucial interactions among the LSC-specific regulators and prognostic gene targets. Both the abundance of available AML patient profiles and the proven ability of our proposed methods suggest that we will achieve our aim to build an LSC-driven prognostic model.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have long been committed to the development of statistical algorithms and software tools for high-throughput data analyses (e.g. the Bioconductor package OrderedList, the online tools GOModule). These tools allow an effective functional integration of transcriptome information with clinical endpoints. This project will systematically build a pre-clinical model of the leukemic stem cell, a critical subpopulation in acute myeloid leukemia that integrates transcriptome, crucial microRNAs, targeting genes, and other biologic/clinical endpoints.

"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.       Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world. By developing new computerized models for the prediction of clinical outcomes based on disease-specific neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers as well as the early prediction of white matter integrity based on genetic profiles, we hope to pave the way to personalized prevention and management of brain disorders.",Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning,8448904,F30AG041681,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Back', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'response', 'time interval', 'treatment response', 'white matter', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F30,2013,47232,-0.007797412070430294

"Fusion of Electromagnetic Brain Imaging and fMRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. We propose to develop state-of-the-art multimodal functional imaging fusion algorithms for accurate visualization of the brain's dynamic activity and high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose to develop algorithms that combine complementary high spatial resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) and high-temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data for high-fidelity reconstruction of brain activity. In recent years, our research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for MEG/EEG imaging superior to existing benchmark algorithms, and we have compared these results with electrocorticography (ECOG). Specifically, our algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we propose to extend this success in M/EEG inverse algorithms into the domain of multimodal imaging data fusion. Our overall goal here is to ultimately produce robust, high fidelity videos of event-related brain activation at a sub-millimeter and sub-millisecond resolution from noisy MEG/EEG and fMRI data using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose to extend a powerful new algorithm that we have recently developed, called Champagne, into two new fusion algorithms that combine fMRI, MEG and EEG data in different ways. Performance of both algorithms will first be rigorously evaluated in simulations, including performance comparisons with existing benchmark fusion algorithms. Algorithms will then tested for consistency on four fMRI-MEG+EEG datasets from healthy controls obtained for identical paradigms (auditory, motor, picture naming and verb-generation) and two fMRI-EEG datasets (face and motion perception). Additional validation studies will also be performed on fMRI-MEG/EEG datasets obtained from epilepsy patients and compared to electrocorticography (ECoG).

"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world.

"Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Medical decision support tools are increasingly available on the Internet and are being used by lay persons as well as health care professionals. The goal of some of these tools is to provide an ""individualized"" prediction of future health care related events such as prognosis in breast cancer given specific information about the individual. These tools are usually based on models synthesized from data with a fine granularity of information. Under the umbrella of ""personalized"" medicine, these individualized prognostic assessments are sought as a means to replace general prognostic information given to patients with specific probability estimates that pertain to a small stratum to which the patient belongs, and ultimately specifically to each patient (i.e., a stratum with n=1). Subsequently, these estimates are used to inform decision making and are therefore of critical importance for public health.   Responsible utilization of prognostic models for patient counseling and medical decision making requires thorough model validation. Verification that the estimated or predicted event probabilities reflect the underlying true probability for a particular individual (i.e., verifying the calibration of the prognostic model) is a critical but often overlooked step in evaluation, which usually favors the verification of the discriminatory ability of the model. Selection of the best predictive model for a given problem should be based on robust comparison that takes into account errors in individual predictions, calibration, and discrimination indices. A robust test for comparison of calibration across different models does not currently exist.   Our specific aims are to: (1) Characterize the main deficiencies of existing calibration indices in the context of individualized predictions and develop a new model-independent calibration index and comparison test that can be used to assess and compare predictive models based on both statistical regression and machine earning methods; (2) Unify the theories on decomposition of error into discrimination and calibration components stemming from the statistical and machine learning communities to derive a refined measure of alteration that can be calculated from measures of error and discrimination. We will compare the performance of the new methods with existing ones in different predictive models derived from real clinical data related to different medical domains.          n/a",Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems,8142647,R01LM009520,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Discrimination', 'Entropy', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Indexes', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'indexing', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'statistics', 'stem', 'theories', 'tool']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2010,159993,0.04624346929027777
"Integrating Quantitative Histological Image and Vascular Density Patterns for Pro    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With increasing detection of early CaP with improved diagnostic methodologies, it has become important to predict biologic behaviors and ""aggressivity"" to identify patients who might benefit from a ""wait and watch policy"" as opposed to those who need more aggressive strategies. Traditionally, T-stage, amount of cancer in the core biopsy, the Gleason grade, and PSA at diagnosis has been used to evaluate the prognosis in localized CaP. While the Gleason score is currently assumed to be the strongest prognostic marker for CaP, there is often considerably high inter-, intra-observer variability associated with Gleason grade determination by pathologists. While some newer markers have recently shown promise, none of these methods have individually proven to be accurate enough to serve routinely as a prognostic marker for CaP.  Recently, there has been a call to combine multiple prognostic markers to create an integrated meta-marker, with potentially greater accuracy in predicting CaP recurrence compared to any individual marker. While it is apparent that prognostic information resides in histopathology imagery in terms of the arrangement of nuclei and glands, sophisticated graph, and computerized image analysis algorithms are required to quantitatively model and characterize the architectural appearance of prostate cancer histopathology and thus provide a marker that is accurate and reproducible (unlike Gleason grade). In addition, while tumor micro-vascular density has been correlated to CaP outcome, prognostic information may also potentially reside in the specific spatial architectural arrangement of the micro-vascular network. The objective of the proposed work is to develop an integrated quantitative prognostic marker that combines information based on architectural arrangement of nuclear, glandular, and micro-vasculature network patterns on whole mount histology sections (WMHS) obtained via radical prostatectomy (RP) to predict prostate cancer recurrence.  The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims. For this project we will digitize approximately 100 annonymized WMHS obtained via RP that have been matched for Gleason score, stage, PSA, but with different clinical outcomes (half the patients having undergone cancer recurrence and the other not, following RP). Under Aim 1, segmentation algorithms will be developed to automatically identify cancerous nuclei, glands and tumor microvasculature (MV), stained immuno-histochemically via CD31. Under Aim 2 we will apply graph based image analysis algorithms to quantitatively characterize the architectural arrangement of CaP nuclei, glands and the MV network. These graph-based features will be integrated via a computerized machine learning algorithm to yield a numerical image based risk score (IbRiS) reflecting the CaP prognosis (disease recurrence or non-recurrence) of the patient. IbRiS will be evaluated in terms of its ability to distinguish between CaP progressors and non-progressors (matched for stage, Gleason grade, PSA), in a cohort of 50 independent studies (test set) for which survival and outcome data is available.  This project will be a collaboration between investigators at Rutgers University (RU) and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Data accrual will be done at UPENN while algorithmic development for computerized image analysis and classification will be carried out at RU.             The broad long term goal of this project is to develop an integrated image based histological biomarker for  predicting  prostate  cancer  (CaP)  survival  and  outcome  by  integrating  quantitative  image  signatures  that  define  tissue  architecture  and  vascular  density  patterns.  Sophisticated  image  analysis  and  graph  based  algorithms will be developed to yield an image based risk score (IbRis) to predict whether or not a CaP patient  will  have  disease  recurrence  following  treatment.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  IbRis  will  prove  to  be  a  better  prognostic marker compared to such traditional markers as Gleason score and PSA.

"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy.

"ROC Based Methods or Risk Factor Prediction and Evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cancer screening with early detection and intervention is a key factor for successful treatment and has shown potential to improve survival and reduce mortality of the cancer patients. ROC based methods have been extensively utilized to evaluate the performance of early detection. However, for evaluating early detection tests of cancer, ROC curves have been either underused or not always used in the best manner. Cancer researchers also need efficient methods to identify risk factors (biomarkers) that could improve the performance of early detection. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new methods for identifying and evaluating the prognostic and diagnostic risk factors (biomarkers) for earlier cancer detection and risk assessment. This pilot project focuses on developing novel ROC based computational models for risk factor identification, biomarker evaluation, and cancer prediction in cancer screening. Both linear and nonlinear models will be developed.

"microRNA signatures of tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This proposal aims to identify unique microRNA signatures that associated with the oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) initiation and progression. The attaining of these molecular signatures will lead to a set of novel biomarkers for the early detection of oral SCC. In addition, the microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will be explored. The strategic integration of our observations at microRNA and mRNA levels will advance the overall understanding of this disease process at system biology level. An additional goal of this proposal is to establish an animal model that permits high throughput genomic analysis of the oral SCC disease process. Most of the early studies utilized a hamster model to study oral cancer. Due to the lack of in-depth knowledge on hamster genome, only limited genomic analyses can be performed on this model. In this study, we will establish a tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer model in mice. Our preliminary results demonstrated the feasibility of this mouse model. This will enable us to perform genome-wide genomic analysis and lead to better understanding of the initiation and progression of this disease, as well as the identification of biomarkers for the early detection of oral cancer. Two specific aims were proposed to accomplish these objectives: The Specific Aim 1 is to establish a mouse oral cancer model induced with physiological tobacco carcinogen. This mouse model will provide us with unique opportunity to study alteration in microRNA (as well as other genome-wide studies) during the course of oral carcinogenesis. The Specific Aim 2 is to identify microRNA signatures and their correlation with mRNA expression patterns for oral cancer initiation and progression.

"Integrating Quantitative Histological Image and Vascular Density Patterns for Pro    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With increasing detection of early CaP with improved diagnostic methodologies, it has become important to predict biologic behaviors and ""aggressivity"" to identify patients who might benefit from a ""wait and watch policy"" as opposed to those who need more aggressive strategies. Traditionally, T-stage, amount of cancer in the core biopsy, the Gleason grade, and PSA at diagnosis has been used to evaluate the prognosis in localized CaP. While the Gleason score is currently assumed to be the strongest prognostic marker for CaP, there is often considerably high inter-, intra-observer variability associated with Gleason grade determination by pathologists. While some newer markers have recently shown promise, none of these methods have individually proven to be accurate enough to serve routinely as a prognostic marker for CaP.  Recently, there has been a call to combine multiple prognostic markers to create an integrated meta-marker, with potentially greater accuracy in predicting CaP recurrence compared to any individual marker. While it is apparent that prognostic information resides in histopathology imagery in terms of the arrangement of nuclei and glands, sophisticated graph, and computerized image analysis algorithms are required to quantitatively model and characterize the architectural appearance of prostate cancer histopathology and thus provide a marker that is accurate and reproducible (unlike Gleason grade). In addition, while tumor micro-vascular density has been correlated to CaP outcome, prognostic information may also potentially reside in the specific spatial architectural arrangement of the micro-vascular network. The objective of the proposed work is to develop an integrated quantitative prognostic marker that combines information based on architectural arrangement of nuclear, glandular, and micro-vasculature network patterns on whole mount histology sections (WMHS) obtained via radical prostatectomy (RP) to predict prostate cancer recurrence.  The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims. For this project we will digitize approximately 100 annonymized WMHS obtained via RP that have been matched for Gleason score, stage, PSA, but with different clinical outcomes (half the patients having undergone cancer recurrence and the other not, following RP). Under Aim 1, segmentation algorithms will be developed to automatically identify cancerous nuclei, glands and tumor microvasculature (MV), stained immuno-histochemically via CD31. Under Aim 2 we will apply graph based image analysis algorithms to quantitatively characterize the architectural arrangement of CaP nuclei, glands and the MV network. These graph-based features will be integrated via a computerized machine learning algorithm to yield a numerical image based risk score (IbRiS) reflecting the CaP prognosis (disease recurrence or non-recurrence) of the patient. IbRiS will be evaluated in terms of its ability to distinguish between CaP progressors and non-progressors (matched for stage, Gleason grade, PSA), in a cohort of 50 independent studies (test set) for which survival and outcome data is available.  This project will be a collaboration between investigators at Rutgers University (RU) and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Data accrual will be done at UPENN while algorithmic development for computerized image analysis and classification will be carried out at RU.             The broad long term goal of this project is to develop an integrated image based histological biomarker for  predicting  prostate  cancer  (CaP)  survival  and  outcome  by  integrating  quantitative  image  signatures  that  define  tissue  architecture  and  vascular  density  patterns.  Sophisticated  image  analysis  and  graph  based  algorithms will be developed to yield an image based risk score (IbRis) to predict whether or not a CaP patient  will  have  disease  recurrence  following  treatment.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  IbRis  will  prove  to  be  a  better  prognostic marker compared to such traditional markers as Gleason score and PSA.

"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights.

"ROC Based Methods or Risk Factor Prediction and Evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cancer screening with early detection and intervention is a key factor for successful treatment and has shown potential to improve survival and reduce mortality of the cancer patients. ROC based methods have been extensively utilized to evaluate the performance of early detection. However, for evaluating early detection tests of cancer, ROC curves have been either underused or not always used in the best manner. Cancer researchers also need efficient methods to identify risk factors (biomarkers) that could improve the performance of early detection. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new methods for identifying and evaluating the prognostic and diagnostic risk factors (biomarkers) for earlier cancer detection and risk assessment. This pilot project focuses on developing novel ROC based computational models for risk factor identification, biomarker evaluation, and cancer prediction in cancer screening. Both linear and nonlinear models will be developed. It will provide efficient computational tools for earlier cancer detection, prevention, and risk assessment.           Public Health Relevant Statement This research will provide computational tools and software for early cancer detection and intervention.

"microRNA signatures of tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This proposal aims to identify unique microRNA signatures that associated with the oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) initiation and progression. The attaining of these molecular signatures will lead to a set of novel biomarkers for the early detection of oral SCC. In addition, the microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will be explored. The strategic integration of our observations at microRNA and mRNA levels will advance the overall understanding of this disease process at system biology level. An additional goal of this proposal is to establish an animal model that permits high throughput genomic analysis of the oral SCC disease process. Most of the early studies utilized a hamster model to study oral cancer. Due to the lack of in-depth knowledge on hamster genome, only limited genomic analyses can be performed on this model. In this study, we will establish a tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer model in mice. Our preliminary results demonstrated the feasibility of this mouse model. This will enable us to perform genome-wide genomic analysis and lead to better understanding of the initiation and progression of this disease, as well as the identification of biomarkers for the early detection of oral cancer. Two specific aims were proposed to accomplish these objectives: The Specific Aim 1 is to establish a mouse oral cancer model induced with physiological tobacco carcinogen. This mouse model will provide us with unique opportunity to study alteration in microRNA (as well as other genome-wide studies) during the course of oral carcinogenesis. The Specific Aim 2 is to identify microRNA signatures and their correlation with mRNA expression patterns for oral cancer initiation and progression.

"GeneRx - colorectal cancer recurrence prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With a projected 55,170 deaths in the United States in 2006, colorectal cancer is second only to lung cancer as the most deadly. Patients with operable, but somewhat advanced, disease (stages II-III) are either observed only or treated with adjuvant therapy to reduce the chances of recurrence after surgery. Although chemotherapy is standard in stage II-III rectal and stage III colon cancer patients, the benefits are restricted to a relatively small fraction of patients. Adjuvant treatment of stage II colon cancer patients is particularly controversial due to the very small benefit in this group. Unfortunately, the prognostic power of simple clinicopathologic data is insufficient to identify high-risk stage II colon cancer patients--or low-risk rectal or stage III colon cancer patients. This proposal describes development of an individualized test based on the status of multiple molecular markers in the patient's tumor to provide an accurate prediction of the risk of recurrence. The molecular markers were carefully selected to provide broad coverage over a range of biological pathways with established prognostic potential. They will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in >600 stage II colorectal cancer patients. Pathologists will score up to 22 markers, as will an automated digital image analysis system for maximal objectivity. Statistical pattern recognition methods will then be used on the data to select a subset of the markers and clinicopathologic features that, when combined with an optimized machine learning algorithm, will produce an accurate model that predicts recurrence. Measuring proteins directly in tumor sections with IHC is arguably one the most relevant strategies available to assess patient prognosis and is widely accepted in the pathology community. Unlike IHC, competing methods like gene expression cannot directly assess protein levels or localization, and it is very difficult or impossible to distinguish normal from tumor cells in the homogenized tissue mixtures that are assayed. Furthermore, unlike most previous related studies, the informatic analyses proposed here include robust, powerful methods to discover complex interactions between markers--maximizing performance--while avoiding overfitting--maximizing the potential for generalizability. The proposed application of advanced quantitative scoring (for objective analysis) and cutting-edge informatics (for complex marker interaction elucidation) to the tried and true IHC protein staining technology is a highly innovative approach to the development of cancer prognostics. The ultimate product will consist of a panel of assays for the relevant molecular markers and the associated prognostic algorithm that predicts recurrence. Colorectal cancer patients and their oncologists will be able to use the results to guide their treatment decisions, resulting in positive impacts on life expectancy and quality of life. With the help of their oncologist, patients with newly diagnosed stage I-III colorectal cancer must decide whether to endure the potentially serious side effects of chemotherapy after surgery in the hopes of preventing a recurrence. However, the benefit of chemotherapy is restricted to a relatively small fraction of these patients, and the predictive ability of current clinical guidelines is relatively crude. The goal of this study is to develop an individualized test that will more accurately predict risk of recurrence based on advanced mathematical analysis of the status of multiple molecular markers within the patient's tumor.

"GeneRx - colorectal cancer recurrence prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With a projected 55,170 deaths in the United States in 2006, colorectal cancer is second only to lung cancer as the most deadly. Patients with operable, but somewhat advanced, disease (stages II-III) are either observed only or treated with adjuvant therapy to reduce the chances of recurrence after surgery. Although chemotherapy is standard in stage II-III rectal and stage III colon cancer patients, the benefits are restricted to a relatively small fraction of patients. Adjuvant treatment of stage II colon cancer patients is particularly controversial due to the very small benefit in this group. Unfortunately, the prognostic power of simple clinicopathologic data is insufficient to identify high-risk stage II colon cancer patients--or low-risk rectal or stage III colon cancer patients. This proposal describes development of an individualized test based on the status of multiple molecular markers in the patient's tumor to provide an accurate prediction of the risk of recurrence.

"Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Medical decision support tools are increasingly available on the Internet and are being used by lay persons as well as health care professionals. The goal of some of these tools is to provide an ""individualized"" prediction of future health care related events such as prognosis in breast cancer given specific information about the individual. These tools are usually based on models synthesized from data with a fine granularity of information. Under the umbrella of ""personalized"" medicine, these individualized prognostic assessments are sought as a means to replace general prognostic information given to patients with specific probability estimates that pertain to a small stratum to which the patient belongs, and ultimately specifically to each patient (i.e., a stratum with n=1). Subsequently, these estimates are used to inform decision making and are therefore of critical importance for public health.   Responsible utilization of prognostic models for patient counseling and medical decision making requires thorough model validation. Verification that the estimated or predicted event probabilities reflect the underlying true probability for a particular individual (i.e., verifying the calibration of the prognostic model) is a critical but often overlooked step in evaluation, which usually favors the verification of the discriminatory ability of the model. Selection of the best predictive model for a given problem should be based on robust comparison that takes into account errors in individual predictions, calibration, and discrimination indices. A robust test for comparison of calibration across different models does not currently exist.   Our specific aims are to: (1) Characterize the main deficiencies of existing calibration indices in the context of individualized predictions and develop a new model-independent calibration index and comparison test that can be used to assess and compare predictive models based on both statistical regression and machine earning methods; (2) Unify the theories on decomposition of error into discrimination and calibration components stemming from the statistical and machine learning communities to derive a refined measure of alteration that can be calculated from measures of error and discrimination. We will compare the performance of the new methods with existing ones in different predictive models derived from real clinical data related to different medical domains.          n/a",Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems,7245581,R01LM009520,[' '],NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2007,380625,0.04624346929027777
"GeneRx - colorectal cancer recurrence prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death. Patients with less-advanced disease (stages l-lll) are either observed only or treated with adjuvant therapy to reduce the chance of recurrence after surgery. Currently, the decision to recommend adjuvant therapy is based almost entirely on conventional clinic pathological data. Most stage III patients are recommended to receive a fluorouracil based chemotherapy, whereas most stage l-ll patients are not. However, limitations in the prognostic power of the clinic pathological data alone likely leads to the unnecessary treatment of stage III patients who do not need it and the lost opportunity for treatment of stage II (and, potentially, stage I) patients that would benefit.  In addition, a significant percentage of stage II patients opt to receive chemotherapy despite the marginal evidence of benefit. An accurate prognostic test would help guide patients with high-risk disease to choose chemotherapy and improve the quality of life of low-risk patients by sparing them from the side effects. This proposal describes the innovative usage of multiple machine learning methodologies as part of a   comprehensive nonlinear model approach to predicting colorectal cancer recurrence based on a combination of standard clinic pathological data and data from multiple, carefully selected molecular markers.

"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice.

"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9912818,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,581743,-0.01828418997089489
"Low-Cost and Compact Multimodal Intraoral Confocal Probe for Oral Cancer Detection and Diagnosis Abstract Oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) together rank as the sixth most common cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 400,000 new cases each year. The 5-year survival rate in the U.S. for OSCC is 62%, the survival rate is only 10-40% and the cure rate around 30% in the developing world. Low survival rate is primarily attributed to the delay in diagnosis and the resultant progression of disease to an advanced stage at diagnosis. Early diagnosis offers the best chance to improved treatment outcomes and survival for an individual diagnosed with OSCC. The objective of this proposed project focuses on developing and evaluating a low-cost, compact, smartphone compatible multimodal intraoral confocal probe for noninvasive in situ detection of oral dysplasia and early stage cancer. The key innovation of the proposed intraoral confocal probe is low-cost and compact confocal intraoral probe using actively addressable point source array - microLED (µLED) without any moving parts to achieve 3D confocal imaging. The wide-FOV autofluorescence imaging (AFI) and polarized white light imaging (pWLI) will identify the suspicious regions with the help of trained neural network and guide confocal scan to obtain tissue microstructure for accurate diagnosis. We will achieve this objective through the following two Aims: (1) develop multimodal confocal imaging probe with µLED array and (2) evaluate the performance and clinical feasibility of multimodal intraoral probe. The proposed project has a great significance. The compact, multimodal handheld intraoral imaging probe, in conjunction with the deep learning image classification method, will enable noninvasive in situ early detection and diagnosis of oral dysplasia and cancer from benign conditions in a clinical setting, significantly reducing disease progression, reducing death rates from oral cancer and improving the quality of life. The cost-effective, smartphone compatible design is extremely suitable for screening oral cancer through remote diagnosis in low- resource setting, significantly improve the survive rate of oral cancers in low- and middle- income countries. Early detection of oral cancer is the effective method for improving both the survival rate and the quality of the lives of the patients.

"Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer Abstract Head and neck cancers are the fifth most common cancer type in the United States, with an overall survival rate lower than 50%. Although the incidence of other sub-sites of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in past decades, the number of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) cases has increased significantly. Most OPSCC patients receive standard cancer therapy.4 However, the clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Predicting early in treatment whether a tumor is likely to respond to treatment is one of the most difficult yet important tasks in providing individualized cancer care.  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known driving oncogenic factor in oropharyngeal cancer, as well as a significant prognostic biomarker for patient survival. Retrospective studies conducted by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium (INHANCE) have demonstrated that clinical biomarkers have prognostic value in helping stratify OPSCC patients into groups with differing risks of death or disease progression. However, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients have similar rates of metastatic spread to HPV-negative patients. The same is true for patient groups stratified with other clinical biomarkers. More robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for optimally effective treatment.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Multiple studies indicate that miRNAs are promising cancer biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in oropharyngeal cancer. Imaging features extracted from medical images are an exciting new class of cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habitats. For several tumor sites, imaging biomarkers have shown promise in accurately separating favorable and unfavorable prognosis patients. However, current efforts to utilize high-dimensional multimodal biomarkers for treatment outcome prediction have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; feature redundancy, heterogeneity, and uncertainty; and patient cohorts with unbalanced outcomes. The correlation, independence, and complementary nature of multimodal biomarkers (imaging, miRNA, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers) remains unexplored as well.  The major goal of this research is to develop a multimodal biomarker-based model that can reliably predict subsets of OPSCC patients with low and high risks for treatment failure. The model will serve as a clinical decision-making tool. Specifically, we propose a novel principle and systematic machine learning-based strategy to effectively identify and seamlessly combine prognostic information carried by multimodal biomarkers. Aim 1: Identify prognostic multimodal biomarkers, given OPSCC patient data. Aim 2: Develop and test a comprehensive multimodal biomarker-based model for predicting OPSCC treatment outcomes. Aim 3: Assess the clinical benefit of the model for OPSCC patient stratification and individualized treatment. Narrative The achievement of this project forms a basis of combining non-invasive imaging biomarkers with miRNAs, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers for accurate cancer prognosis and discovering the correlation with genetic mechanisms leading to specific tumor phenotypes. This clinical decision-making tool can provide useful information to support patient stratification and individualized treatment.

"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the O’Neil Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world. Project Narrative Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate, is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options on an individualized basis to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world.",Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment.,10080473,R43CA254493,"['Age', 'Alabama', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biomimetics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infusion procedures', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Performance Status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Right to Treatments', 'Serum Albumin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Surface Properties', 'Survival Rate', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically translatable', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'drug testing', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'ineffective therapies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tissue culture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,"CERFLUX, INC.",R43,2020,249148,-0.007396384793683591
"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,9954467,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2020,402913,0.010591634251201366
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9940707,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,450262,0.06635719788822761
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, and involves a complicated interplay between functional infor- mation interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. functional and structural measures. However, the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities misses a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimen- sional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we devel- oped advanced approaches to capture high-dimensional relationships among 2 or more modalities. Our work continues to strongly support the benefits of multimodal data fusion to both provide a more complete picture of brain function and structure, but also to improve our ability to study and predict the impact of complex mental illness. In this new phase of the project, we will focus on methods that can fill some existing gaps, such as the ability to bridge spatial/temporal as well as structural/functional connectivity scales. We also propose a novel framework to integrate unimodal and multimodal features called chromatic fusion, which searches for combina- tions of multimodal `notes' which occupy a unique position in a latent (or dictionary) space. The proposed meth- ods will be validated using simulations, hybrid-data, and large N normative imaging data. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly tested using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symp- toms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression). We will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via GitHub and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 37 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and our work has clearly shown the substantial benefits of ex- tracting multimodal features estimated jointly from the data. In this renewal, we focus on some key understudied areas including fusing across vast spatiotemporal and functional/structural connectivity scales as well as devel- oping powerful new frameworks for integrating the resulting information to enable decision making and enable identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. Completion of our aims will result in a powerful new toolkit for data fusion of multimodal brain imaging data. 36",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,10058554,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data fusion', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542808,0.019221465776292072
"Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia The American Cancer Society estimates that 48,330 new cases of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx will be reported this year. When diagnosed at early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83%. However, when diagnosed at intermediate or advance stages, the 5-year survival rate drops to 62% and 38%, respectively. In addition, while early stage treatment may only require minor surgery to remove the localized tumor, later stage treatment could require surgical removal of parts of the face and neck, hence drastically reducing the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, benign oral lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or early invasive cancer even for healthcare professionals. As a result, only 31% of patients are diagnosed at early stages despite the fact that the oral cavity is easily accessible for direct examination. Hence, there is a critical need for new clinical technologies for reliable early diagnosis of oral cancer and dysplasia. Several screening tools for oral cancer have been commercially available, including exfoliative cytology, vital staining, salivary test, and optical interrogation; however, none of them have been demonstrated to be capable of clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that several biomarkers for oral cancer and dysplasia can be accurately quantified by endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) thus enabling levels of sensitivity and specificity adequate for early detection. This bioengineering research grant focuses on developing and validating a cost-effective wide-field multispectral FLIM endoscope for noninvasive in situ detection of oral cancer and dysplasia. To that end we have developed three specific aims. Aim 1: To design and build a cost-effective multispectral FLIM endoscope for in vivo imaging of epithelial tissue in the oral cavity. Aim 2: To develop algorithms for fast and automated FLIM based early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. Aim 3: To quantify prospectively in a pilot clinical study the capability of the proposed FLIM endoscopic tools for noninvasively early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. The successful completion of these aims will result in a novel, accurate and cost-effective clinical tool for noninvasive in situ early detection of cancer and dysplasia. Such a tool could potentially help to improve significantly both the life expectancy and the quality of life for the more than 33,000 oral cancer patients being diagnosed each year at intermediate and advance stages. Beyond early diagnosis, this tool could also assist at every step involved on the clinical management of oral cancer patients, including treatment guidance and monitoring of disease recurrence. Finally, the demonstrated success of this clinical tool in oral epithelial cancer will herald future success with other cancers of epithelial origin, which accounts for more than 80% of all cancers. Early detection of both new and recurrent oral cancer holds great promise for improving both the survival rate and the quality of live of these patients. The proposed work is to develop a clinical tool capable of quantifying noninvasively different biomarkers associated to oral epithelial cancer progression and detecting early stage oral cancer and dysplasia. Such tool will revolutionize oral epithelial cancer management by allowing not only early screening and diagnosis, but also treatment guidance and monitoring for disease recurrence.",Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia,10005895,R01CA218739,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Coenzymes', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Situ', 'Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mild Dysplasia', 'Minor Surgical Procedures', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring for Recurrence', 'Neck', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Oral Stage', 'Oral cavity', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Salivary', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'early screening', 'exfoliative cytology', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'oral dysplasia', 'oral lesion', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2020,522053,0.08711997626802313
"DR. EPS: Drug Repurposing for Extended Patient Survival Project Summary Human cancers are complex diseases that present vast heterogeneity, leading to widely different survival outcomes. Thus actionable and robust predictive models for cancer prognosis are much needed for more personalized treatment and disease management. However, There has been severely lacking of therapeutically actionable computational methods, which explicitly model patient survival difference as the objective while integrating multi-dimension high-throughput genomics data. To solve this issue, we propose a novel actionable framework for caner drug repurposing, called DR. EPS (Drug Repurposing for Extended Patient Survival). Towards this goal, we will develop the following strategies: (1) Constructing and validating a new class of hybrid-learning based, multi-omics prognosis modeling approach, using seven diverse liver cancer population cohorts. (2) Developing and experimentally validating an actionable computational drug- repurposing framework to improve the survival of high-risk liver cancer patients, using big sets of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics data. (3) Building a user-friendly webtool that accelerates such bench-to-bed transition for liver cancer treatment. We expect that this project will be groundbreaking in many aspects, including building new prognostic models on multi-omics data sets, identifying new repurposed drugs to extend high-risk liver cancer patient life-spans, and providing a first-hand drug reposition resource for liver cancer therapeutics research community. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop an actionable drug-repurposing framework, in order to extend the survival time of high-risk liver cancer patients. We will first build and validate novel and robust prognostic computational models that integrate multi-omics cancer data, then use signatures obtained from the high-risk survival group are to identify repurposed drug candidates.

"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,9842277,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,413430,-0.012491674970861247
"Microfluidic intact cell platform: A novel tool for oral cancer detection Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) claims the lives of thousands in the U.S. and hundreds of thousands worldwide annually. A biopsy followed by histopathology, the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSCC, is painful, invasive, costly, not practical if longitudinal assessments of the same lesion are required and oftentimes is not available or imprecise in third world countries. A tool that quickly distinguishes cancerous from non- cancerous lesions and identifies progressive or transforming lesions could allow for early intervention, which would improve outcomes and negate the need for unnecessary biopsies in patients whose lesions remain benign or haven’t begun to degenerate. Therefore, there is an unmet need for a rapid, non-invasive, objective and cost-effective test for OSCC. We and others have reported that an altered expression profile of human beta defensin 3 (hBD-3), an epithelial cell derived antimicrobial peptide (AMP), and hBD-2, another epithelial cell AMP, is an early event in OSCC. Therefore, the ratio of hBD-3 and hBD-2 in the lesion, when compared to the contralateral site, could be exploited in distinguishing OSCC from other lesions of the oral cavity. We refer to this ratio as the beta defensin index (BDI). Our ongoing clinical study of 78 subjects with suspicious oral lesions demonstrated high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (74%) of the ELISA based BDI in distinguishing cancerous from noncancerous oral lesions (P<0.0001). With the high accuracy (98%) of our BDI based molecular assay, we now wish to advance our novel platform from the laborious, time consuming ELISA format into an imaging-based point-of-care (POC) device that utilizes microfluidic technology to quantify the BDI with an expected turnover time of half an hour. Our microfluidic intact cell assay (MICA) approach to developing a POC device for oral cancer detection is unique; it utilizes intact epithelial cells trapped in a microfluidic chip encompassing microfabricated pillar arrays with varying spaces to allow the capture of epithelial cells. Upon capture, the cells are permeabilized and labeled with fluorescent antibodies for hBD ratio analysis. We employ automated fluorescence imaging and computational algorithm to enable automated calculation of the BDI scores. We now hypothesize that the ELISA format that can effectively detect oral cancer, can be configured for point of care MICA, retaining its high accuracy and making it easier to use worldwide. To advance the discovery of this new approach for oral cancer detection, we propose the following aims: 1. Develop a working prototype of a MICA POC device for oral cancer testing equipped with cell imaging and BDI calculation capabilities. 2. Conduct a discovery phase study where MICA POC and ELISA, as independent assays, will be compared with pathology review in their ability to detect oral cancer. The MICA POC, while not intending to replace biopsy, could be deployed, in the future, to objectively and non- invasively determine who actually needs a biopsy, monitor oral premalignant lesions in real world practice and fulfill a major unmet need in low-socio economic countries where pathology review is lacking and/or unreliable. Narrative Oral cancer (OC) kills thousands in the U.S. and hundreds of thousands worldwide, and early detection is key to improved survival. Since biopsy followed by pathology review, the gold standard for OC, is costly, painful, can result in patient complications, is impractical should monitoring be required, and is often not available or imprecise in third world countries, we intend to develop (Aim 1), and test in humans (Aim 2), an innovative device that will accurately detect OC, non-invasively, within ½ hour and thereby will address a major unmet need in early OC detection worldwide. The device will incorporate microfluidic, imaging and computational technologies that will determine the ratios of two key proteins from swabbed cells obtained from suspicious oral lesions; a procedure we have already shown to be accurate using a laboratory based technique.",Microfluidic intact cell platform: A novel tool for oral cancer detection,10043470,R21CA253108,"['Address', 'Aliquot', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancerous', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cations', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Research', 'Coin', 'Collaborations', 'Collecting Cell', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Contralateral', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Dental Clinics', 'Detection', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health care facility', 'Histopathology', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immobilization', 'India', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mouth Carcinoma', 'Myelogenous', 'Non-Invasive Lesion', 'Observational Study', 'Oral', 'Oral Stage', 'Oral cavity', 'Oral mucous membrane structure', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Swab', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'University Hospitals', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'beta pleated sheet', 'beta-Defensins', 'beta-defensin 3', 'biomarker development', 'cellular imaging', 'chemokine', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging platform', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'metaplastic cell transformation', 'microfluidic technology', 'monitoring device', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'mucosal site', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral lesion', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'portability', 'portable monitoring', 'premalignant', 'primary care setting', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'scalpel', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tertiary care', 'tool']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,413972,0.014137987192072515
