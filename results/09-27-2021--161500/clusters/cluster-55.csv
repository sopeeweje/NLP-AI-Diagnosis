"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and their babies.","A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy",9776011,R44HD092205,"['African American', 'Amniocentesis', 'Anemia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conceptions', 'Conceptus', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA purification', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speculums', 'Technology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vagina', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'alpha-Thalassemia', 'base', 'beta Thalassemia', 'cell free fetal DNA', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'exome', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'fetus at risk', 'fetus cell', 'flexibility', 'hemoglobin B', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal obesity', 'maternal serum', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'operation', 'performance tests', 'perinatal health', 'phase 1 study', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'reproductive', 'reproductive tract', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'testing services', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational medicine', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,"CRADLE GENOMICS, INC.",R44,2019,1098375,-0.03767407909584003
"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9766330,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'competitive environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2019,468098,0.06085306890864481
"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9693291,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contig', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2019,397125,0.0044072143677955445
"PiNDA - Fully integrated software platform for Preimplantation Genetic Testing - Aneuploidy (PGT-A) PROJECT SUMMARY  Since its inception 40 years ago, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of more than 1 million babies in the United States, and has revolutionized the field of reproductive medicine. Unfortunately, the success rate of IVF is still exceedingly low, especially for women >40 years old, with only 15.5% of implanted embryos resulting in pregnancy. This is partly due to the cytological method used for pre-implantation screening, which cannot detect the most common genetic defect during IVF, aneuploidy (i.e. chromosomal copy-number variation). Aneuploidy is linked to higher rates of miscarriage, and occurs more often in women >40 years of age; thus, aneuploidy has been a frequent target for genetic screening to improve IVF outcomes.  Pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) refers to a variety of techniques aimed at detecting changes in chromosomal copy number, with the goal of identifying high-quality euploid embryos for implantation. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it possible to screen embryos at higher levels of precision, and across a wider range of genetic defects, including mosaicism, triploidy and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite these remarkable advances, there are still significant challenges with PGT-A sequencing. Indeed, the most commonly implemented software for PGT-A (i.e. BlueFuse® ) are bundled with specific sequencing platforms (i.e. VeriSeq®), and are only designed to test for aneuploidy. Furthermore, existing pipelines are not user-friendly or customizable, which is a serious obstacle prohibiting the use of NGS by clinicians / embryologists. A more accessible bioinformatics platform is desperately needed that will bridge the gap between PGT-A sequencing and IVF outcomes.  Basepair™ is an innovator in efficient, user-friendly, web-based NGS analysis systems, with fully automated ChIP-, RNA-, ATAC-, and DNA-Seq bioinformatics pipelines available online. Here, Basepair will deliver PiNDA™, the first fully integrated software solution for comprehensive PGT-A analysis. In Aim 1, we will develop modules to test for specific chromosomal abnormalities, including mosaicism and triploidy, and validate each model with training data derived from somatic cell lines with known chromosomal aberrations. In Aim 2, we will integrate our modules into the PiNDA software system, creating a user-friendly, web-based interface that will perform full data analysis (raw data to full summary report) in <15 minutes, with no manual input required. Final data will be accessible via Basepair’s online portal, facilitating rapid data transfer from embryologists to physicians, and supporting the integration of NGS tests in IVF. Our innovative bioinformatics platform will accelerate NGS analysis for IVF, improving rates of pregnancy and advancing research in the success of IVF procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In vitro fertilization (IVF) methods have begun to leverage next-generation sequencing technologies for pre-implantation genetic testing of aneuploidy (PGT-A), expanding the array of chromosomal abnormalities that can be accurately detected. However, the vast majority of software can only distinguish one type of genetic defect (i.e. aneuploidy), are difficult to use, and are tied to distinct sequencing platforms, limiting the clinical utility of resulting analyses. Basepair™ Inc. is a pioneer in user-friendly, web-based bioinformatics pipelines, providing comprehensive services for a wide range of sequencing projects. Here, Basepair will develop an inclusive suite of software for PGT-A, compatible with sequencing data from multiple platforms.

"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults. The relevance of the project to public health is reflected in the long-term goal, which is to construct a genetic risk profile which can be used by health-care providers and educators to identify individuals genetically at risk for chronic tinnitus.",Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,9655203,R21DC016704,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Audiology', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Hyperacusis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrial Arts', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Otitis Media', 'PTGS1 gene', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Tinnitus', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'college', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hearing impairment', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'relating to nervous system', 'serotonin receptor', 'serotonin transporter', 'sound', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'voltage gated channel', 'young adult']",NIDCD,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,151994,-0.03854186219280111
"Novel approaches to map DNA replication traffic in a genome-wide scale PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish novel genomics and bioinformatics approaches to model patterns of DNA replication in cells. It is known that the patterns of DNA replication are intimately linked to the cell type. These differences between cell types are relevant to the integrity of the genome during cell type transitions. For example, we recently found that damage during DNA replication is increased during the induced transition from one cell type to another. However, there is a lack of methodology to observe replication patterns in human cells. DNA replication differs between different cell types in the location of initiation, the direction of fork progression, and the timing of initiation and completion. There is currently no method that can comprehensively map the progression of DNA replication to the genome. Because of the importance of DNA replication in cell proliferation, there is need for the development of such methods. To be able to examine the progression of DNA polymerases in human cells, we will develop a novel methodology to map DNA replication genome-wide, by incorporating nucleotide analogs during DNA replication, and sequencing the resulting DNA molecules by Nanopore sequencing and recording the electrical signals. In parallel, we will develop novel bioinformatics approaches to reliably examine the electrical signals and identify bases or regions of DNA replication, for comparison between different cell types, or between healthy and diseased tissues. Successful establishment of this technology will greatly increase our knowledge of replication, genetic stability and cell proliferation, and allow the community to characterize differences in the progression of DNA replication between cell types. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel genomic and bioinformatics methods to map how DNA is replicated in the human genome in different cells or different diseases. These methods will help us better understand patterns of DNA replication and genetic stability, ultimately yielding insights into cell proliferation in development, cancer and other diseases.",Novel approaches to map DNA replication traffic in a genome-wide scale,9743541,R21HG010165,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Asians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biological Process', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cultured Cells', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Markers', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA replication fork', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Names', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Price', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Replication Initiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'electrical property', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'nanopore', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nucleotide analog', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'stem cell differentiation', 'tumor progression']",NHGRI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2019,262177,-0.0022879736086754278
"The Enzymatic Reader Project Summary At this point in time, it is generally understood and agreed upon that single-molecule sequencing (SMS) is the future of genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and epitranscriptomics due to its significant advantages over other technologies and methods. However, in order for these advantages to be fully realized, and for SMS to become the “gold standard” sequencing approach, significant issues and hurdles must be solved and overcome. During this program, Electronic BioSciences, Inc. (EBS) aims to demonstrate a completely new and enabling SMS method that will possess the ability to directly and correctly identify individual nucleotides, including chemically modified nucleotides. During this project, we will both demonstrate the ability of this entirely new sequencing approach to sequence DNA with high accuracy (directly comparing the obtained accuracy, throughput, error mechanisms and associated rates to other SMS approaches) and correctly identify (and sequence) 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its derivatives, at the single molecule level. At the conclusion of this Phase I project, we will have successfully demonstrated an entirely new and dramatically improved SMS approach, and reduced the associated risks involved with its full future commercial developments. There is a current need within the field of next generation sequencing (NGS) or so called third generation sequencing (TGS) for new, enabling instrumentation that is capable of high-accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats. The entirely new SMS methodology that will be developed during this project will overcome known hurdles and limitations of currently available NGS, TGS, and SMS technologies, resulting in technology that is cost-efficient, highly accurate, easy to setup and utilize, capable of de novo sequencing and modified base calling, and yields highly simplistic data for easy analysis and post possessing. Through significant advancements made during this program, this resulting technology will revolutionize the use of the genome and epigenome, radically change standard R&D and clinical practices, and greatly advance clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making. Project Narrative The novel single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technology developed during this project will enable high- accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats via a cost-efficient and easy-to-use methodology. The impact of these advances in SMS will eventually enable wide-scale, routine clinical care and diagnostics toward advanced precision medicine, not just R&D. The performance and accessibility of such technology will transform the understanding and application of genomics and epigenomics, the associated clinical practices, that ability to provide precision clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making for improved public healthcare and wellbeing.",The Enzymatic Reader,9677956,R43HG010427,"['Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Caliber', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Church', 'Complex', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA polymerase A', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Drops', 'Electrodes', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Logistics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reader', 'Reading Frames', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Stretching', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'electric field', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'epitranscriptomics', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanopore', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research and development', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,"ELECTRONIC BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2019,247611,0.042744615999631974
"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once. This will help scientists find important genetic features of canine cancers, match them to specific human cancers, and translate what we learn into new cancer therapeutics.",Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,9671372,R37CA218570,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Canis familiaris', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dog family', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Silicones', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Veterinarians', 'actionable mutation', 'analysis pipeline', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'citizen science', 'classifier algorithm', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational cancer research', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R37,2019,634586,-0.05045426507073551
"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology. Results have the potential to lead to novel targeted therapy for atherosclerosis.",Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis,9801966,R01HL148109,"['Alanine', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Aorta', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Iowa', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Null Lymphocytes', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Threonine', 'Translating', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'calcification', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary plaque', 'dimer', 'genome editing', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oxidized low density lipoprotein', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,687622,-0.0160236780313116
"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales.

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research.

This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing.

"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9498252,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2018,158992,0.0044072143677955445

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,9203633,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Integration', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,309913,0.010187297959799859
"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study?

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9172062,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Molecular Models', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2016,584552,0.06085306890864481
"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation. Determination of their sequence structures will allow better understanding of how organisms control these physiological events through glycosaminoglycans.",Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores,9109642,R21GM118339,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Glycobiology', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Imidazole', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocyte Trafficking', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mammals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trisaccharides', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional group', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'polysulfated glycosaminoglycan', 'programs', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'stem', 'sugar', 'sulfation', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'tool']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2016,271743,0.020761349859788406
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8998963,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,306949,0.010187297959799859

"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK. The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies. This is essential to realize the potential of DNA sequencing to understand human history, diversity, and to discover  new loci associated with human disease, leading to new biologic hypotheses and new drug targets.",Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis,8788050,U01HG006569,"['Algorithms', 'Biological Sciences', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Documentation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Floods', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Philosophy', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'computerized data processing', 'data management', 'distributed data', 'distributed memory', 'exome', 'genome analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'shared memory', 'tool']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2015,967608,0.05836681438461629
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment. In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation. Determination of their sequence structures will allow better understanding of how organisms control these physiological events through glycosaminoglycans.            ",Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores,8984813,R21GM118339,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Glycobiology', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imidazole', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocyte Trafficking', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mammals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trisaccharides', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional group', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'polysulfated glycosaminoglycan', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'stem', 'sugar', 'sulfation', 'tool']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2015,273816,0.020761349859788406
"Integrating epigenomic maps to predict regulatory functions of genetic variants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illnesses are some of the most devastating diseases affecting human populations, placing a huge burden on individuals, families and society. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with psychiatric diseases, but a majority of those SNPs have been mapped to intergenic or intronic regions and are functionally unclassified. Existing software or algorithms only query multiple databases and produce lists of hits without intelligent integration and ignore much of the valuable regulatory information. The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate all available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data to generate a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression level in brain. Our previous studies have shown that psychiatric GWAS signals are enriched with brain eQTL SNPs (eSNPs), and these brain eSNPs are likely to be functional and contribute to disease susceptibilities. We will use SNPs in eQTLs to anchor a chain of evidence incorporating histone marks, conserved sequences, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation, accessible chromatins, non-coding RNA, and other data. We will use a machine learning method to predict regulatory SNPs based on known relationships between these epigenetic marks and their target genes, as well as their distinct patterns in genome. We will also use our novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type (i.e., neuron vs. non-neuron) specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our predictions. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Quantitative PCR and CRISPR-cas9 will be used on induced pluripotent cell lines to compare gene expression levels of alleles of predicted functional SNPs. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will made public via a website and standalone application. The novel algorithm will significantly improve our understanding of psychiatric disease genetics by uncovering the gene-regulatory functions for disease-associated, non-coding SNPs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common SNPs associated with major complex diseases, but the majority of those SNPs are located in non-coding regions, leaving those genetic associations functionally unexplained. Existing functional predication software or algorithms only query some databases without providing statistical or biological integration, and dismiss much valuable regulatory information. We propose to integrate all the available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data and use machine learning to produce a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression levels in brain. We will also use a novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our prediction.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8795204,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,304719,0.010187297959799859
"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study? (3) How to accurately capture possible interactions between multiple genetic factors and their joint contribution to phenotypic variation?

"Advanced Development of TIES-Enhancing Access to Tissue for Cancer Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Archived human tissues are an essential resource for translational research. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from cancer patients are used in a wide range of assays, including RT-PCR, SNP profiling, multiplex biomarkers, imaging biomarkers, targeted exome, whole exome, and whole genome sequencing. Remainder FFPE tissues generated during patient care are 'retrospective'; use of these tissues under specific conditions does not require consent. For personalized medicine researchers, these specimens are vital resources enabling biomarker validation, detailed molecular analysis, and systems modeling before application is made to individual patients. But access to these human tissues is often a rate limiting factor in cancer research. We propose advanced development of the TIES software to (1) increase institutional capacity for using FFPE to support molecular characterization of human tumors, (2) increase access to tissues within cancer centers, and (3) improve the ability to share tissues and associated phenotype data among cancer centers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This work proposes the development of a software system that will enhance the ability of cancer researchers to find and use human tissues and accompanying electronic data for scientific research.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.            ",Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing,8683213,R01HG006870,"['Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bruck-de Lange syndrome', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cholesterol', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Internet', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'xenopus development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2014,221252,0.022940953095916743
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.        The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies. This is essential to realize the potential of DNA sequencing to understand human history, diversity, and to discover  new loci associated with human disease, leading to new biologic hypotheses and new drug targets.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility. PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases. We will then apply these new computational methods to identifying genetic biomarkers of bladder cancer in an epidemiological study from New Hampshire.",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,9019684,R01LM009012,[' '],NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,358350,0.08433013055540663
"Integrating epigenomic maps to predict regulatory functions of genetic variants     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illnesses are some of the most devastating diseases affecting human populations, placing a huge burden on individuals, families and society. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with psychiatric diseases, but a majority of those SNPs have been mapped to intergenic or intronic regions and are functionally unclassified. Existing software or algorithms only query multiple databases and produce lists of hits without intelligent integration and ignore much of the valuable regulatory information. The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate all available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data to generate a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression level in brain. Our previous studies have shown that psychiatric GWAS signals are enriched with brain eQTL SNPs (eSNPs), and these brain eSNPs are likely to be functional and contribute to disease susceptibilities. We will use SNPs in eQTLs to anchor a chain of evidence incorporating histone marks, conserved sequences, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation, accessible chromatins, non-coding RNA, and other data. We will use a machine learning method to predict regulatory SNPs based on known relationships between these epigenetic marks and their target genes, as well as their distinct patterns in genome. We will also use our novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type (i.e., neuron vs. non-neuron) specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our predictions. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Quantitative PCR and CRISPR-cas9 will be used on induced pluripotent cell lines to compare gene expression levels of alleles of predicted functional SNPs. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will made public via a website and standalone application. The novel algorithm will significantly improve our understanding of psychiatric disease genetics by uncovering the gene-regulatory functions for disease-associated, non-coding SNPs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common SNPs associated with major complex diseases, but the majority of those SNPs are located in non-coding regions, leaving those genetic associations functionally unexplained. Existing functional predication software or algorithms only query some databases without providing statistical or biological integration, and dismiss much valuable regulatory information. We propose to integrate all the available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data and use machine learning to produce a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression levels in brain. We will also use a novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our prediction. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will be made public via a website and standalone application.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases. It will identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma from a genome wide association study.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape  Title: Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape PI: Rohs, Remo (USC); Co-I: Noble, William Stafford (UW); Co-I: Tullius, Thomas D. (BU) PROJECT SUMMARY Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.            ",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8632246,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2014,334303,0.008549505075915615

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from cancer patients are used in a wide range of assays, including RT-PCR, SNP profiling, multiplex biomarkers, imaging biomarkers, targeted exome, whole exome, and whole genome sequencing. Remainder FFPE tissues generated during patient care are 'retrospective'; use of these tissues under specific conditions does not require consent. For personalized medicine researchers, these specimens are vital resources enabling biomarker validation, detailed molecular analysis, and systems modeling before application is made to individual patients. But access to these human tissues is often a rate limiting factor in cancer research. We propose advanced development of the TIES software to (1) increase institutional capacity for using FFPE to support molecular characterization of human tumors, (2) increase access to tissues within cancer centers, and (3) improve the ability to share tissues and associated phenotype data among cancer centers.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This work proposes the development of a software system that will enhance the ability of cancer researchers to find and use human tissues and accompanying electronic data for scientific research. By increasing access to tissues and data, this work seeks to increase the speed of scientific discoveries that will ultimately impact cancer patients.

"New Physical Methodologies for Genomic Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite substantial efforts in developing sequencing technologies and computational software, spanning over 30 years, the full genome of any but the simplest organisms is still unable to automatically reconstructed. The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes. These proposed advancements will be cradled within a new generation of nanofluidic devices engendering novel means for molecular control and detection. Such efforts will be directed by state-of-the art computer simulations that will model novel aspects of the new platforms for allowing rapid loops of design/implementation/testing. The main thrust of these technological developments will be carefully guided and serve a broad-based bioinformatics framework that will be developed for this work while laying the basis for highly integrated approaches to genome assembly and analysis.          Development of new machines and software is proposed, which will rapidly analyze a person's genome and reveal new types of information that doctors will be able to use for treating patients. The machines that will be developed are actually very small devices that may one day be sufficiently miniaturized to fit in a person's hand.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information. This project will develop methods to identify diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations,8528722,R01LM010685,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Blood specimen', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enrollment', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'research clinical testing', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,305913,0.020354134541257594
"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.            ",Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing,8518436,R01HG006870,"['Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bruck-de Lange syndrome', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cholesterol', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Internet', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'xenopus development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2013,220626,0.022940953095916743
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.        The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies. This is essential to realize the potential of DNA sequencing to understand human history, diversity, and to discover  new loci associated with human disease, leading to new biologic hypotheses and new drug targets.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.        While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to quickly identify data sets of interest, expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate test incorporating multiple phenotypes, and perform larger meta-analyses easily by honing in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest with increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.

"Second generation sequencing and analysis for cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kevin Squire is a PhD in Electrical Engineering and former Computer Science professor with a strong interest in bioinformatics and human genetics. To this end, he joined Dr. Stanley F. Nelson's laboratory as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Human Genetics at UCLA one year ago, in order to retrain in bioinformatics and sequencing. Kevin's background in machine learning gives him a good foundation for a career in bioinformatics. What he needs, and what obtaining this grant will give him, is a good background in basic biology, biochemistry, and genetics, in order to better understand the biological processes behind the data he is working with. Kevin explorations in genetics have inspired him to make his career in this field. He hopes to gain a much better understanding of biology in order to ask and answer research questions relevant to the biology of cancer using second (and later) generation sequencing and through the use and development of relevant tools and analysis. As part of the research development plan, Kevin will complete a didactic coursework component in the first 2 years, to fill in the gaps in biology and bioinformatics in his background. During and after that, his research will focus on giving him a better understanding the genetics of cancer, attempting to answer relevant research questions from high throughput genomic sequencing data, through the use and creation of sequence analysis tools and other bioinformatics tools. Through his coursework and research, Kevin will attain the necessary skills to become an independent researcher in bioinformatics and genetics.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer is a genetic disease, caused by mutations in DNA and other genetic changes which affect how cells work. The work in this proposal uses and enhances new sequencing technology to help accurately determine exactly what changes are occurring in tumor DNA and RNA, which in turn affect protein production and the health of the cell. While much of the work is broadly applicable, the research will be evaluated in glioblastoma, the most common and most deadly form of brain cancer, and will help determine the best course of treatment for patients with this disease.         ",Second generation sequencing and analysis for cancer,8471121,K25GM097097,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Exons', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Patients', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Spliced Genes', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genomics', 'career', 'computer science', 'disease-causing mutation', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic selection', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'interest', 'methylome', 'next generation sequencing', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'resistance mechanism', 'skills', 'temozolomide', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K25,2013,123483,0.01871997418050639
"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases. It will identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma from a genome wide association study.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"Advanced Development of TIES-Enhancing Access to Tissue for Cancer Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Archived human tissues are an essential resource for translational research. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from cancer patients are used in a wide range of assays, including RT-PCR, SNP profiling, multiplex biomarkers, imaging biomarkers, targeted exome, whole exome, and whole genome sequencing. Remainder FFPE tissues generated during patient care are 'retrospective'; use of these tissues under specific conditions does not require consent. For personalized medicine researchers, these specimens are vital resources enabling biomarker validation, detailed molecular analysis, and systems modeling before application is made to individual patients. But access to these human tissues is often a rate limiting factor in cancer research. We propose advanced development of the TIES software to (1) increase institutional capacity for using FFPE to support molecular characterization of human tumors, (2) increase access to tissues within cancer centers, and (3) improve the ability to share tissues and associated phenotype data among cancer centers.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This work proposes the development of a software system that will enhance the ability of cancer researchers to find and use human tissues and accompanying electronic data for scientific research.

"New Physical Methodologies for Genomic Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite substantial efforts in developing sequencing technologies and computational software, spanning over 30 years, the full genome of any but the simplest organisms is still unable to automatically reconstructed. The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes. These proposed advancements will be cradled within a new generation of nanofluidic devices engendering novel means for molecular control and detection. Such efforts will be directed by state-of-the art computer simulations that will model novel aspects of the new platforms for allowing rapid loops of design/implementation/testing. The main thrust of these technological developments will be carefully guided and serve a broad-based bioinformatics framework that will be developed for this work while laying the basis for highly integrated approaches to genome assembly and analysis.          Development of new machines and software is proposed, which will rapidly analyze a person's genome and reveal new types of information that doctors will be able to use for treating patients. The machines that will be developed are actually very small devices that may one day be sufficiently miniaturized to fit in a person's hand.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information. This project will develop methods to identify diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations,8326646,R01LM010685,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Blood specimen', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enrollment', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'research clinical testing', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,332514,0.020354134541257594
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately.

By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.        While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies.

"DNA repair, Cell cycle Checkpoints and Apoptosis and Bladder Cancer Risk My long-term goal is to become an independent molecular epidemiologist with in-depth training in genetics and advanced statistical methods in order to be able to analyzehigh throughput gene variant data to explore gene- gene and gene-environment interactions in cancer susceptibility. Mycareer development plan includedidatic courses/seminars, meetings with mentors in the areas of human genetics, cancer biology and advanced statistical methods. Myresearch proposal will focus on genetic susceptibility of blader cancer (BC). I propose to capitalize on availabilityof epidemiologicand genentic marker data from an on-going case-control study, ""Markers of GeneticSusceptibilityto Bladder Cancer""(R01 CA74880,PI:Xifeng. Wu). The parent study currently include over 2,500,mostly Caucasian,BCcases and controls, matched on sex, age and ethnicity. Mygoal is to identify novel loci that confer bladder cancer susceptibility using state-of-the-art genotyping techology and novel statistical and bioinformaticstools. The Specific Aims are: 1) To enhance my knowledge and skills in genetics and statistics to identify novel genetic loci as susceptibility markers of BC by extending the original45 potential functional SNPs to include additional 2112 tagging SNPs in genes in the DNArepair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways in 800 Caucasiancases and 800 Caucasiancontrols using the Illumina Golden Gate Assay; 2) To assess haplotypes and diplotypes as markers of susceptibility; 3) To use bioinformaticstools to assess functional significance of SNPs in the DNArepair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways and to correlate genotype data of DNArepair and cell cycle control with functional data derived from phenotypic assays. The secondary aim is to apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to explore any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions influencing BCrisk. My project complements the parent grant in that it: 1) adds tagging SNPs to potential functional SNPs addressed in the parent grant; 2) adds haplotype analyses; 3) proposes novel statistical and bioinformaticsapproaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Bladder cancer is a tobacco-related cancer which is the fourth most common cancer in men in U.S. The fact that only a fraction of smokers develop bladder caricer indicating genetic susceptibility to the disease.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,8242887,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2012,769079,0.11186448230502062
"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility.

The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"New Physical Methodologies for Genomic Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite substantial efforts in developing sequencing technologies and computational software, spanning over 30 years, the full genome of any but the simplest organisms is still unable to automatically reconstructed. The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes. These proposed advancements will be cradled within a new generation of nanofluidic devices engendering novel means for molecular control and detection. Such efforts will be directed by state-of-the art computer simulations that will model novel aspects of the new platforms for allowing rapid loops of design/implementation/testing. The main thrust of these technological developments will be carefully guided and serve a broad-based bioinformatics framework that will be developed for this work while laying the basis for highly integrated approaches to genome assembly and analysis.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of new machines and software is proposed, which will rapidly analyze a person's genome and reveal new types of information that doctors will be able to use for treating patients.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information. This project will develop methods to identify diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations,8042010,R01LM010685,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Blood specimen', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enrollment', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'research clinical testing', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,336864,0.020354134541257594
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases. It will identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma from a genome wide association study.                             Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal.

"DNA repair, Cell cycle Checkpoints and Apoptosis and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term goal is to become an independent molecular epidemiologist with in-depth training in genetics and advanced statistical methods in order to be able to analyze high throughput gene variant data to explore gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in cancer susceptibility. My career development plan include didatic courses/seminars, meetings with mentors in the areas of human genetics, cancer biology and advanced statistical methods. My research proposal will focus on genetic susceptibility of bladder cancer (BC). I propose to capitalize on availability of epidemiologic and genetic marker data from an on-going case-control study, ""Markers of Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer""(R01 CA74880,PI:Xifeng. Wu). The parent study currently include over 2,500,mostly Caucasian, BC cases and controls, matched on sex, age and ethnicity. My goal is to identify novel loci that confer bladder cancer susceptibility using state-of-the-art genotyping technology and novel statistical and bioinformatics tools. The Specific Aims are: 1) To enhance my knowledge and skills in genetics and statistics to identify novel genetic loci as susceptibility markers of BC by extending the original45 potential functional SNPs to include additional 2112 tagging SNPs in genes in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways in 800 Caucasian cases and 800 Caucasian controls using the Illumina Golden Gate Assay; 2) To assess haplotypes and diplotypes as markers of susceptibility; 3) To use bioinformatics tools to assess functional significance of SNPs in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways and to correlate genotype data of DNA repair and cell cycle control with functional data derived from phenotypic assays. The secondary aim is to apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to explore any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions influencing BC risk. My project complements the parent grant in that it: 1) adds tagging SNPs to potential functional SNPs addressed in the parent grant; 2) adds haplotype analyses; 3) proposes novel statistical and bioinformatics approaches. RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is a tobacco-related cancer which is the fourth most common cancer in men in U.S. The fact that only a fraction of smokers develop bladder cancer indicating genetic susceptibility to the disease. This study will identify novel genetic markers may be useful as biomarkers to identify high-risk populations that could then be targeted for intervention programs.          n/a","DNA repair, Cell cycle Checkpoints and Apoptosis and Bladder Cancer Risk",8065522,K07CA134831,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinogen Metabolism', 'Carcinogens', 'Case Study', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Journal of the National Cancer Institute', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mutagens', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nutritional', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'career development', 'case control', 'college', 'coping', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genotyping technology', 'high risk', 'intervention program', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'men', 'new technology', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'sex', 'skills', 'statistics', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K07,2011,137995,0.08970146710027158
"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for HNPCC, which may also have important implications for sporadic colorectal cancer as well as other cancer sites.             n/a",Molecular Genetics of HNPCC,8067773,R01CA070759,"['Abbreviations', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Budgets', 'CDK4 gene', 'CHEK2 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Cyclin D1', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Individual', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'MDM2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mutate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preventive', 'Proteolysis', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'STK6 gene', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Ubiquitination', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora-A kinase', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cdc Genes', 'early onset', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'homologous recombination', 'mutation carrier', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'protein protein interaction', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2011,530841,0.08755387080565084
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,8054297,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2011,669490,0.11186448230502062
"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.              The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.",Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer,8059620,R01CA131324,"['African American', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'CCRL2 gene', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case Study', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Control Groups', 'County', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Carcinogens', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Histologic', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Larynx', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant Squamous Cell Neoplasm', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Mutagens', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Squamous Cell', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Trees', 'Trust', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'adduct', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'metropolitan', 'novel', 'plasmid DNA', 'population based', 'repository', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tobacco exposure', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2011,594620,0.0273579033143492
"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD.",International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder,8076751,R01MH085542,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood specimen', 'Boston', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Europe', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Los Angeles', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Predisposition', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Sweden', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disability burden', 'early onset disorder', 'economic cost', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genotyping technology', 'instrument', 'novel', 'phenomics', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'sample collection', 'success', 'treatment as usual', 'validation studies']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2011,2046824,0.026753308692765754
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases. We will then apply these new computational methods to identifying genetic biomarkers of bladder cancer in an epidemiological study from New Hampshire.",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,8008651,R01LM009012,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'New Hampshire', 'Predisposition', 'Research', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer type', 'combinatorial', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'population based', 'programs', 'statistics']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2010,392680,0.08433013055540663
"Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic variants and environmental factors interacting in a composite and potentially nonlinear manner. Although the genome-wide views provided by advanced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays present an opportunity to discover previously unrecognized genomic patterns, the ability to recognize such complex features of genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association study to discover genetic determinants of health and disease from massive genomic data. The focus of this application is the development and validation of effective computational statistics approaches to detect complex interaction effects of multi-locus SNPs which could be useful for classification and prediction of disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of complex phenotypes. Based on very promising preliminary studies, the specific aims of this R21 application are carefully designed: (1) to refine and evaluate the recently developed significant conditional association (SCA) criterion and heuristic combinatorial interaction growing (HCIG) search strategy (specifically designed to discover complex interaction effects of multi-locus jointly-predictive SNPs), test and validate on real SNP based realistic simulations and compare with a panel of most relevant existing methods; and (2) to apply SCA- HCIG method to the real SNP data of NIAMS-funded FMS cohort in relationship to metabolic syndrome etc. and develop SNP marker based classification/ prediction models, assessed by the prediction power and initial biological plausibility of the implicated SNP subsets. This proposal represents a unique cross-disciplinary collaboration focusing on the development of new analytical methods to more effectively identify interacting susceptibility SNPs and environmental factors that can be used to determine individual risk to a specific disease and to estimate prognosis and response to treatment. The results could also suggest novel preventive intervetions and therapeutic targets, reduce the burden of diseases, and accelerate the realization of truly personalized medicine.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Wang, Yue (Joseph), Ph.D. Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects Project Narrative  Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic and environmental factors.

"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          n/a",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7910732,K25HG004035,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Embryology', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemolysin', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Physics', 'Poly C', 'Poly U', 'Polymers', 'RNA', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uracil', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell analyzer', 'copolymer', 'design', 'improved', 'laptop', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'single molecule', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2010,164921,0.0542453571950812
"Multi-point and multi-locus analysis of genomic association data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a new and powerful approach to investigate the effect of inherited genetic variation on risks of complex diseases. With recent advances in genotyping technology, genome-wide association studies are now becoming a reality. Data from GWAS are expected in an accelerated rate. Despite tremendous efforts in developing efficient algorithms for mapping complex diseases/traits, single-locus based approaches are still the primary method for GWAS. However, it is known that usually multiple genetic factors, environmental factors as well as their interactions play an important role in the etiology of complex diseases. Novel and practical approaches to simultaneously model multiple variables and their interactions from hundreds of thousands single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are greatly needed. In this project, we propose to develop efficient algorithms and practical statistical tools to address two important problems in the context of genome- wide association studies: multi-point analysis and multi-locus analysis. For multi-point analysis, our Dynamic Hidden Chain Markov Model (DHCMM) can jointly model historical recombination and muta- tions, haplotype structures and frequencies, and associations, which is expected to be more effective than existing approaches. For multi-locus analysis, we propose to use an advanced machine learning approach to jointly screen SNPs that are predictive of diseases. Our integrated software system MAVEN will facilitate management, analysis, visualization and results sharing of GWA data using cut- ting edge technologies.

"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal.

"DNA repair, Cell cycle Checkpoints and Apoptosis and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term goal is to become an independent molecular epidemiologist with in-depth training in genetics and advanced statistical methods in order to be able to analyze high throughput gene variant data to explore gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in cancer susceptibility. My career development plan include didatic courses/seminars, meetings with mentors in the areas of human genetics, cancer biology and advanced statistical methods. My research proposal will focus on genetic susceptibility of bladder cancer (BC). I propose to capitalize on availability of epidemiologic and genetic marker data from an on-going case-control study, ""Markers of Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer""(R01 CA74880,PI:Xifeng. Wu). The parent study currently include over 2,500,mostly Caucasian, BC cases and controls, matched on sex, age and ethnicity. My goal is to identify novel loci that confer bladder cancer susceptibility using state-of-the-art genotyping technology and novel statistical and bioinformatics tools. The Specific Aims are: 1) To enhance my knowledge and skills in genetics and statistics to identify novel genetic loci as susceptibility markers of BC by extending the original45 potential functional SNPs to include additional 2112 tagging SNPs in genes in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways in 800 Caucasian cases and 800 Caucasian controls using the Illumina Golden Gate Assay; 2) To assess haplotypes and diplotypes as markers of susceptibility; 3) To use bioinformatics tools to assess functional significance of SNPs in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways and to correlate genotype data of DNA repair and cell cycle control with functional data derived from phenotypic assays. The secondary aim is to apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to explore any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions influencing BC risk. My project complements the parent grant in that it: 1) adds tagging SNPs to potential functional SNPs addressed in the parent grant; 2) adds haplotype analyses; 3) proposes novel statistical and bioinformatics approaches. RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is a tobacco-related cancer which is the fourth most common cancer in men in U.S. The fact that only a fraction of smokers develop bladder cancer indicating genetic susceptibility to the disease. This study will identify novel genetic markers may be useful as biomarkers to identify high-risk populations that could then be targeted for intervention programs.          n/a","DNA repair, Cell cycle Checkpoints and Apoptosis and Bladder Cancer Risk",7848344,K07CA134831,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinogen Metabolism', 'Carcinogens', 'Case Study', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Journal of the National Cancer Institute', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mutagens', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nutritional', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'career development', 'case control', 'college', 'coping', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genotyping technology', 'high risk', 'intervention program', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'men', 'new technology', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'sex', 'skills', 'statistics', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K07,2010,134919,0.08970146710027158
"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for HNPCC, which may also have important implications for sporadic colorectal cancer as well as other cancer sites.             n/a",Molecular Genetics of HNPCC,7793567,R01CA070759,"['Abbreviations', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Budgets', 'CHEK2 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Cyclin D1', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Individual', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'MDM2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mutate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preventive', 'Proteolysis', 'Public Health', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'STK6 gene', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Ubiquitination', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora-A kinase', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cdc Genes', 'early onset', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'homologous recombination', 'mutation carrier', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'protein protein interaction', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2010,567593,0.08755387080565084
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7799290,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2010,1196434,0.11186448230502062
"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7842564,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2010,290690,0.11519345789973506
"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.

"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4).

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction.

We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2).

"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             n/a",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7910931,U24CA126561,"['Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feeds', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Molecular Target', 'Public Health', 'Random Allocation', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Silver', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'cancer genome', 'cost', 'data portal', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput technology', 'interest', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2009,523967,0.007551943752253136
"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          n/a",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7687632,K25HG004035,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Embryology', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemolysin', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Physics', 'Poly C', 'Poly U', 'Polymers', 'RNA', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uracil', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell analyzer', 'copolymer', 'design', 'improved', 'laptop', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'single molecule', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2009,165961,0.0542453571950812
"Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic variants and environmental factors interacting in a composite and potentially nonlinear manner. Although the genome-wide views provided by advanced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays present an opportunity to discover previously unrecognized genomic patterns, the ability to recognize such complex features of genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association study to discover genetic determinants of health and disease from massive genomic data. The focus of this application is the development and validation of effective computational statistics approaches to detect complex interaction effects of multi-locus SNPs which could be useful for classification and prediction of disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of complex phenotypes. Based on very promising preliminary studies, the specific aims of this R21 application are carefully designed: (1) to refine and evaluate the recently developed significant conditional association (SCA) criterion and heuristic combinatorial interaction growing (HCIG) search strategy (specifically designed to discover complex interaction effects of multi-locus jointly-predictive SNPs), test and validate on real SNP based realistic simulations and compare with a panel of most relevant existing methods; and (2) to apply SCA- HCIG method to the real SNP data of NIAMS-funded FMS cohort in relationship to metabolic syndrome etc. and develop SNP marker based classification/ prediction models, assessed by the prediction power and initial biological plausibility of the implicated SNP subsets. This proposal represents a unique cross-disciplinary collaboration focusing on the development of new analytical methods to more effectively identify interacting susceptibility SNPs and environmental factors that can be used to determine individual risk to a specific disease and to estimate prognosis and response to treatment. The results could also suggest novel preventive intervetions and therapeutic targets, reduce the burden of diseases, and accelerate the realization of truly personalized medicine.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Wang, Yue (Joseph), Ph.D. Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects Project Narrative  Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic and environmental factors.

"Multi-point and multi-locus analysis of genomic association data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a new and powerful approach to investigate the effect of inherited genetic variation on risks of complex diseases. With recent advances in genotyping technology, genome-wide association studies are now becoming a reality. Data from GWAS are expected in an accelerated rate. Despite tremendous efforts in developing efficient algorithms for mapping complex diseases/traits, single-locus based approaches are still the primary method for GWAS. However, it is known that usually multiple genetic factors, environmental factors as well as their interactions play an important role in the etiology of complex diseases. Novel and practical approaches to simultaneously model multiple variables and their interactions from hundreds of thousands single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are greatly needed. In this project, we propose to develop efficient algorithms and practical statistical tools to address two important problems in the context of genome- wide association studies: multi-point analysis and multi-locus analysis. For multi-point analysis, our Dynamic Hidden Chain Markov Model (DHCMM) can jointly model historical recombination and muta- tions, haplotype structures and frequencies, and associations, which is expected to be more effective than existing approaches. For multi-locus analysis, we propose to use an advanced machine learning approach to jointly screen SNPs that are predictive of diseases. Our integrated software system MAVEN will facilitate management, analysis, visualization and results sharing of GWA data using cut- ting edge technologies.

"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

"DNA repair, Cell cycle Checkpoints and Apoptosis and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term goal is to become an independent molecular epidemiologist with in-depth training in genetics and advanced statistical methods in order to be able to analyze high throughput gene variant data to explore gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in cancer susceptibility. My career development plan include didatic courses/seminars, meetings with mentors in the areas of human genetics, cancer biology and advanced statistical methods. My research proposal will focus on genetic susceptibility of bladder cancer (BC). I propose to capitalize on availability of epidemiologic and genetic marker data from an on-going case-control study, ""Markers of Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer""(R01 CA74880,PI:Xifeng. Wu). The parent study currently include over 2,500,mostly Caucasian, BC cases and controls, matched on sex, age and ethnicity. My goal is to identify novel loci that confer bladder cancer susceptibility using state-of-the-art genotyping technology and novel statistical and bioinformatics tools. The Specific Aims are: 1) To enhance my knowledge and skills in genetics and statistics to identify novel genetic loci as susceptibility markers of BC by extending the original45 potential functional SNPs to include additional 2112 tagging SNPs in genes in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways in 800 Caucasian cases and 800 Caucasian controls using the Illumina Golden Gate Assay; 2) To assess haplotypes and diplotypes as markers of susceptibility; 3) To use bioinformatics tools to assess functional significance of SNPs in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways and to correlate genotype data of DNA repair and cell cycle control with functional data derived from phenotypic assays. The secondary aim is to apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to explore any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions influencing BC risk. My project complements the parent grant in that it: 1) adds tagging SNPs to potential functional SNPs addressed in the parent grant; 2) adds haplotype analyses; 3) proposes novel statistical and bioinformatics approaches. RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is a tobacco-related cancer which is the fourth most common cancer in men in U.S. The fact that only a fraction of smokers develop bladder cancer indicating genetic susceptibility to the disease.

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7591153,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2009,1090595,0.11186448230502062

"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7625225,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2009,290689,0.11519345789973506
"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.

"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). The methods developed here will be applied to nearly 1500 haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) across approximately 300 cancer susceptibility genes measured in 542 subjects with bladder cancer and 745 healthy controls ascertained as part of a large epidemiological study from the state of New Hampshire.          n/a",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,7485154,R01LM009012,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boxing', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'New Hampshire', 'Numbers', 'Predisposition', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'analytical method', 'cancer type', 'combinatorial', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2008,304625,0.0981793065798788
"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             n/a",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7499105,U24CA126561,"['Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feeds', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Molecular Target', 'Numbers', 'Public Health', 'Random Allocation', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Silver', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'cancer genome', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput technology', 'interest', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2008,773823,0.007551943752253136
"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          n/a",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7492192,K25HG004035,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Embryology', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemolysin', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Physics', 'Poly C', 'Poly U', 'Polymers', 'RNA', 'Rate', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uracil', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell analyzer', 'copolymer', 'design', 'desire', 'improved', 'laptop', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'single molecule', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2008,161298,0.0542453571950812
"Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposed study will build upon the extensive epidemiologic database and specimen repository derived from an ongoing bladder cancer study entitled ""Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer: A Molecular Epidemiologic Approach"" (RO1 CA74880, PI: Xifeng Wu). The parent grant involved a multidisciplinary group of researchers applying a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to bladder carcinogenesis, with a focus on genes involved in protecting against genomic instability, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, and telomere maintenance. It is increasing recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). We have recently shown that an IL-6 promoter SNP (G-174C) is associated with BC risk and progression. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that BC is modulated by common, low penetrance polymorphisms in inflammation related genes, interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. We will take a pathway based genotyping approach and apply novel statistical tools to address the hypothesis. There are 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify candidate polymorphisms in inflammation related genes that predispose individuals to BC. We plan to perform genotyping of a comprehensive list of potential functional polymorphisms in inflammation genes (85 polymorphisms in 44 genes) on 1000 Caucasian cases and 1000 controls matched on age, gender, and ethnicity. Specific Aim 2: To perform genotyping on tagging SNPs for the top 8 candidate genes that were identified in Specific Aim 1 (using a significance level of 0.1) identified in Specific Aim 1. This will give us a complete picture of the role that the specific gene plays in BC etiology. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional variants that might have been missed using individual SNP-based approaches. Specific Aim 3: To apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene- gene interactions influencing risk for BC. These analyses will examine SNP main effects and gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interaction and develop and validate algorithms, which will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. The application will allow us to have a comprehensive picture of the effects of functional polymorphisms in inflammation related genes on BC risk.          n/a",Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk,7458073,R03CA130063,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Significance Level', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'college', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'promoter', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R03,2008,77000,0.04587814393162395
"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for HNPCC, which may also have important implications for sporadic colorectal cancer as well as other cancer sites.             n/a",Molecular Genetics of HNPCC,7467185,R01CA070759,"['Abbreviations', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Budgets', 'CDKN1A gene', 'CHEK2 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Cyclin D1', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Individual', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'MDM2 gene', 'MDM2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mutate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Numbers', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preventive', 'Proteolysis', 'Public Health', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'STK6 gene', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoke', 'Specimen', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Ubiquitination', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora-A kinase', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cdc Genes', 'early onset', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'homologous recombination', 'mutation carrier', 'novel', 'oncoprotein p21', 'p27 Cell Cycle Protein', 'p27 Enzyme Inhibitor', 'peripheral blood', 'protein protein interaction', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2008,493284,0.08755387080565084
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7387530,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2008,1077416,0.11186448230502062
"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         n/a",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7447802,R21GM073617,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Pattern Recognition', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteriophage mu', 'Base Pairing', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Caliber', 'Canada', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA mapping', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Enzymes', 'Exonuclease', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Hemolysin', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pore Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teflon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Vestibule', 'base', 'detector', 'ear helix', 'electric field', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'polymerization', 'professor', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2008,100329,-0.00270313686147028
"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7383901,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2008,285166,0.11519345789973506
"Statistical and Computational Methods for Systematically Mining the SNP and Gene     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application is submitted in response to PAR-04-159 ``Small Grants Program for Cancer Epidemiology'' `Analyzing existing data that otherwise may have gone unexplored, such as pooled analysis of data from multiple studies coordinated into consortia.' A quick review of research articles in current literature, there are only tens of paper related to cancer study with integrated SNP and gene expression data. The lack of algorithms and user-friendly software to mine the existing data may be partly blamed. The proposed study will provide useful tools to mine the genetic data from different sources. This pilot project focuses on developing efficient algorithms for clustering, molecular network construction, and biomarker discovery with integrated SNP and gene expression data. With the efficient data mining methods we develop, cancer researchers may get much more useful information from the otherwise unexplored data. Therefore it has broad implications in the analysis of all high priority areas in cancer epidemiology research identified by Progress Review Groups, such as multiple myeloma and cancers of the breast, colon/rectum, prostate, lung, pancreas, and brain, and linking genetic polymorphisms with other variable related to cancer risk.

"International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. Advances in population genetics and genotyping technologies have recently made the genetic dissection of complex disorders like BPD a feasible project. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have already identified susceptibility variants underlying a range of other common medical disorders. However, it has become clear that much larger samples than are currently available will be needed to achieve such successes for BPD. This application is a response by an international consortium of investigators to RFA-MH-08-130: ""Genomic Parsing of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia: Studies of Large Cohorts in the U.S. and Across the Globe."" The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD. The specific aims of this application are 1) to ascertain and collect a large cohort of BPD cases (N = 9000) and unaffected controls (N = 9000) over five years at two U.S. sites (Boston and Los Angeles) using novel high-throughput phenotyping methods; and 2) to construct a harmonized data resource for genetic studies combining phenotypic data from the U.S. case-control sample with a parallel, separately funded European case-control sample (10,000 cases and 10,000 controls) obtained from the UK and Sweden. Separately funded genotyping and genetic analyses of these resources will fully characterize common polymorphisms and copy number variants in the full sample to detect novel risk variants and attempt replication of the most compelling prior findings. This resource, augmented by existing samples, will provide an unprecedented platform for the discovery of the genetic determinants of BPD. Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost. Genetic susceptibility is the strongest known risk factor for BPD, and the identification of specific susceptibility genes would have enormous implications for advancing our understanding of the biology of BPD and revealing novel targets for treatment. The limited success to date of genetic studies of BPD has been due to its complex genetic architecture that likely includes many contributing loci of modest effect. The proposed International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD) will address the need for large-scale DNA and data resources by establishing a uniquely large collection of samples and data from individuals with BPD.           Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a major public health priority, responsible for a vast burden of disability, personal suffering, and economic cost.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). The methods developed here will be applied to nearly 1500 haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) across approximately 300 cancer susceptibility genes measured in 542 subjects with bladder cancer and 745 healthy controls ascertained as part of a large epidemiological study from the state of New Hampshire.          n/a",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,7279853,R01LM009012,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boxing', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'New Hampshire', 'Numbers', 'Predisposition', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'analytical method', 'cancer type', 'combinatorial', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2007,310526,0.0981793065798788
"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             n/a",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7294347,U24CA126561,"['Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feeds', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Molecular Target', 'Numbers', 'Public Health', 'Random Allocation', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Silver', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'cancer genome', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput technology', 'interest', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2007,766160,0.007551943752253136
"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          n/a",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7281328,K25HG004035,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Embryology', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemolysin', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Physics', 'Poly C', 'Poly U', 'Polymers', 'RNA', 'Rate', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uracil', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell analyzer', 'copolymer', 'design', 'desire', 'improved', 'laptop', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'single molecule', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2007,128462,0.0542453571950812
"Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposed study will build upon the extensive epidemiologic database and specimen repository derived from an ongoing bladder cancer study entitled ""Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer: A Molecular Epidemiologic Approach"" (RO1 CA74880, PI: Xifeng Wu). The parent grant involved a multidisciplinary group of researchers applying a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to bladder carcinogenesis, with a focus on genes involved in protecting against genomic instability, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, and telomere maintenance. It is increasing recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). We have recently shown that an IL-6 promoter SNP (G-174C) is associated with BC risk and progression. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that BC is modulated by common, low penetrance polymorphisms in inflammation related genes, interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. We will take a pathway based genotyping approach and apply novel statistical tools to address the hypothesis. There are 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify candidate polymorphisms in inflammation related genes that predispose individuals to BC. We plan to perform genotyping of a comprehensive list of potential functional polymorphisms in inflammation genes (85 polymorphisms in 44 genes) on 1000 Caucasian cases and 1000 controls matched on age, gender, and ethnicity. Specific Aim 2: To perform genotyping on tagging SNPs for the top 8 candidate genes that were identified in Specific Aim 1 (using a significance level of 0.1) identified in Specific Aim 1. This will give us a complete picture of the role that the specific gene plays in BC etiology. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional variants that might have been missed using individual SNP-based approaches. Specific Aim 3: To apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene- gene interactions influencing risk for BC. These analyses will examine SNP main effects and gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interaction and develop and validate algorithms, which will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. The application will allow us to have a comprehensive picture of the effects of functional polymorphisms in inflammation related genes on BC risk.          n/a",Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk,7320980,R03CA130063,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Significance Level', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'college', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'promoter', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UT MD ANDERSON CANCER CTR,R03,2007,77000,0.04587814393162395
"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         n/a",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7229898,R21GM073617,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Pattern Recognition', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteriophage mu', 'Base Pairing', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Caliber', 'Canada', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA mapping', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Enzymes', 'Exonuclease', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Hemolysin', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pore Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teflon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Vestibule', 'base', 'detector', 'ear helix', 'electric field', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'polymerization', 'professor', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2007,143598,-0.00270313686147028
"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              n/a",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7214011,R01LM007174,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Asthma', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Process', 'Buffers', 'Catalysis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molting', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translation Process', 'Work', 'base', 'falls', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure function']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2007,312439,0.11519345789973506

With the efficient data mining methods we develop, cancer researchers may get much more useful information from the otherwise unexplored data.

"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          n/a",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7130891,K25HG004035,"['RNA', 'bioinformatics', 'cell sorting', 'copolymer', 'electrical potential', 'genome', 'hemolysin', 'human', 'learning', 'nucleotides', 'polymers']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2006,124719,0.0542453571950812
"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             n/a",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7233923,U24CA126561,"['CpG islands', 'clinical research', 'genome', 'neoplasm /cancer']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2006,781539,0.007551943752253136
"Software Relating Genes to Disease and Clinical Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of a software system is proposed that will combine statistical theory, computer science algorithms, and genetics expertise to take advantage of the great influx of data generated by the study of the human genome, clinical trials data and the creation of inexpensive genotyping techniques. This software will elucidate the complex relationship between drug efficacy and side effects, multiple interacting genes and environmental factors.      Our Phase I results show it is feasible to link phenotype to genotype for a list of ""candidate"" genes.

"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elaboration of the sequences of the human genome and those of many cellular and viral parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease. It has also resulted in the formation of an entirely new field, bioinformatics, which promises to manage and analyze the vast amount of data being generated. Bioinformatics needs to supply tools for data analysis and tools for experimental design. Most of the scientific and corporate resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology. Essentially every experiment in biology now begins with cloning one or more pieces of DNA. Commercial software that facilitates virtual DNA cloning does exist, but it lacks any automation features and depends on primitive and/or fragmentary gene and vector databases. It is inadequate in planning the hundreds or thousands of clones necessary to address questions posed by the proteomics initiatives, because the lack of knowledge integration. In Phase I of this SBIR grant, we have built and tested a virtual cloning expert system, along with a very useful gene database and a uniquely annotated vector database that serve as a knowledge base for automated DNA manipulations. A collection of automated cloning modules and databases is now functional. In Phase II we will complete the virtual cloning expert system and develop a flexible platform for automated experimental design, data management and analysis. We will also construct a user database, improve the user interface and establish security protocols.

"BioHDF - Open Binary File Standards for Bioinformatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Geospiza Inc. and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) are creating a standards based software framework around NCSA's Heirarchical Data Format (HDF5). The envisioned framework will integrate algorithms important in DNA and protein sequence analysis to create scalable high throughput software systems which will be accessed using new graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to provide researchers with new views of their data to finish sequencing projects in large-scale genome sequencing, microbial genome sequencing, viral epidemiology, polymorphism detection, phylogenetic analysis, multi-locus sequence typing, confirmatory sequencing, and EST analysis.    In our vision, algorithms will be either integrated into the system to directly read and write from HDF5 project files, or they will communicate with project files via filter programs that produce standardized XML formatted data. Through this model, a scalable solution will support different applications of DNA sequencing, fulfilling the many needs and requirements expressed by the medical research community now and into the future. As the first step in this process we will, define requirements for editing and versioning data in DNA sequencing, research and propose data models for the computational phases of DNA sequencing and annotating DNA sequence data using existing standards, create a prototype application for DNA sequencing based SNP discovery, and engage the bioinformatics community for BioHDF adoption.       In the past ten years the cost of sequencing DNA has dropped over 1000 fold and the amount of raw sequence data, entering our national repositories is doubling every 12 months. DNA sequencing is fundamental to biological research activities such as genomics, systems biology, and clinical medicine. Proposals are being sought to decrease sequencing costs by two orders of magnitude through technology refinements with an ultimate vision of developing technology to sequence human genome equivalents for $1000 each. The amount of data that will be produced through these endeavors is unimaginable.

Genomics initiatives identify proteins at the genome level and demand the generation of hundreds of expression clones for recombinant protein production in exogenous hosts such as E. coli.  Establishment of libraries of expression clones requires automation and optimization as well as effective means of data storage, archiving, annotation and query.  To address these needs, as well as to facilitate routine DNA manipulations in virtually any molecular biology laboratory, we propose (1) to test and build a task centered virtual cloning expert system that serves as a knowledge base for DNA manipulations, and (2) to test and build an information automaton for the construction of expression clone libraries in support of structural genomics initiatives and other high throughput experiments.         n/a",Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning,6583437,R43GM067279,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' expression cloning', ' gene expression', ' genetic library', ' genetic manipulation', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' transfection /expression vector']",NIGMS,"VIRMATICS, LLC",R43,2003,100000,0.012362013581411134
"Software Relating Genes to Disease and Clinical Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of a software system is proposed that will combine statistical theory, computer science algorithms, and genetics expertise to take advantage of the great influx of data generated by the study of the human genome, clinical trials data and the creation of inexpensive genotyping techniques. This software will elucidate the complex relationship between drug efficacy and side effects, multiple interacting genes and environmental factors.      Our Phase I results show it is feasible to link phenotype to genotype for a list of ""candidate"" genes. A novel haplotype trend test has been developed to aid in finding associations across large SNP maps. Commercialization of this technique is essential for companies that intend to use large public or private SNP maps to locate genes that are associated with disease and drug safety and efficacy. Our statistical methods are expected to be successful even if the disease mechanism can differ from one person to another.      By analyzing and interpreting clinical trial data, the software will match drugs to target populations according to their specific genotype. This will enable pharmaceutical companies to create novel drugs that render maximum effectiveness and have minimum side effects, i.e. the right drug for the right person.         n/a",Software Relating Genes to Disease and Clinical Outcomes,6582179,R44GM062081,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' drug adverse effect', ' drug screening /evaluation', ' gene environment interaction', ' health care facility information system', ' molecular biology information system', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,"GOLDEN HELIX, INC.",R44,2003,538979,0.04415877527769811

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system.

"Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome project spurred the            development of high throughput technologies, especially in the area of DNA           sequencing. Not only has this effort produced a draft of the human genome, it's      catalyzed development of an entire industry based on DNA sequencing and              genomics. Since these technologies produce enormous amounts of data they depend      on bioinformatics programs for data management. Phrap, Cross_Match,                  RepeatMasker and Consed are four programs that played an integral role in the        human genome project and became accepted as standard. However, as the                technology for sequencing has evolved, so too, have the applications. These new      applications include sequencing additional genomes, EST cluster analysis, and        genotyping and they have highlighted the need to update standard bioinformatics      programs to meet the current needs of a broader community. In this project we        will re-engineer Phrap, Cross_Match and Repeat Masker to improve performance by      optimizing these algorithms and developing a hierarchical data file to store         and manipulate assembled sequence data. Phrap and Cross_Match will also be           modified to use XML-formatted data allowing users to apply constraints to            sequence assembly. Lastly, we will develop a new program to review, edit, and        manipulate sequences, thus giving users unprecedented control over their data.      PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:                                                                                     Phrap is widely used in industry and academia for applications involving DNA sequences.  There are over 100 commercial sites that would benefit from new versions of Phrap that support incremental assemblies and utilize computer resources better.  An API for Phrap will encourage application development creating additional commercialization possibilities for algorithm and application developers. n/a",Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools,6444292,R44HG002244,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' genotype', ' informatics', ' mathematical model', ' nucleic acid sequence']",NHGRI,"GEOSPIZA, INC.",R44,2002,531259,0.040152057411154844
"Pharmacogenetic Prediction of Paroxetine Response  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes the development of a computational model, called GeneRx, to incorporate pharmacogenetics and nonlinear adaptive algorithms toward optimizing anti-schizophrenic therapy on a patient specific basis.   Preliminary studies on the anti-schizophrenic drug olanzapine show a 40% patient-by-patient error between predicted starting dose and optimal therapeutic dose, using a prototype trained only with patient chart information. This is a significant reduction from the range of starting doses for olanzapine currently used, which is from 1 to 80 mgs/day. Anti-schizophrenic drugs likewise have a large window of therapeutic options, including significant variation in dosages, medications, and combinations of therapies used. Using patient-specific genetic information in conjunction with patient medical chart information, obtained from schizophrenia studies performed by outside sources, we propose to develop computational models to predict efficacy of treatment (i.e. Response/Non-response) to the neuroleptic risperidone. Genetic data for each patient will be acquired by genotyping DNA from the blood samples, scored as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present or absent in key schizophrenia-related genes. GeneRx will take a patient's individual genetic, demographic, and environmental variables and predict if the patient will respond initial risperidone drug therapy. Response will be measured by change in standard severity test scores. A more efficient method to prescribe effective anti-schizophrenic pharmaceuticals would expedite recovery, minimize side effects, and reduce medical costs.   n/a",Pharmacogenetic Prediction of Paroxetine Response,6550614,R43MH066671,"['antipsychotic agents', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavioral genetics', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' depression', ' genetic polymorphism', ' genotype', ' human genetic material tag', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' paroxetine', ' pharmacogenetics', ' serotonin inhibitor']",NIMH,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R43,2002,100000,6.430734163612479e-05

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6062376,R21CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2000,154460,0.015997644320134535

"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10010243,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Capital', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phosphoramidite', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'research and development', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2020,374524,-0.0067201363444901385
"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and their babies.","A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy",9940863,R44HD092205,"['African American', 'Amniocentesis', 'Anemia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conceptions', 'Conceptus', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA purification', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speculums', 'Technology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vagina', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'alpha-Thalassemia', 'base', 'beta Thalassemia', 'cell free fetal DNA', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'data infrastructure', 'exome', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'fetus at risk', 'fetus cell', 'flexibility', 'genetic testing', 'genomic locus', 'hemoglobin B', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal obesity', 'maternal serum', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'operation', 'performance tests', 'perinatal health', 'phase 1 study', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'reproductive', 'reproductive tract', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'testing services', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational medicine', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,"CRADLE GENOMICS, INC.",R44,2020,901625,-0.03767407909584003
"Scalable detection and interpretation of structural variation in human genomes PROJECT SUMMARY Structural variation (SV), is a diverse class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications, as well as balanced rearrangements, such as inversions and reciprocal translocations. A typical human genome harbors >4,000 SVs larger than 300bp and their large size increases the potential to delete or duplicate genes, disrupt chromatin structure, and alter expression. Despite their prevalence and potential for phenotypic consequence, SVs remain notoriously difficult to detect and genotype with high accuracy. Much of this difficulty is driven by the fact DNA sequence alignment “signals” indicating SVs are far more complex than for single-nucleotide and insertion deletion variants. Unlike SNP alignments that vary only in allele state, alignments supporting SVs vary in state (supports an alternate structure or not) alignment location, and type. Consequently, the accuracy of SV discovery is much lower than that of SNPs and INDELs. Furthermore, SV pipelines scale poorly and are difficult to run. These challenges are a barrier for single genome analysis and studies of families must invest substantial effort into eliminating a sea of false positives. These problems become exponentially more acute for large-scale sequencing efforts such as TOPmed, the Centers for Common Disease Genetics, and the All of Us program. Software efficiency is key to scalability for such projects. However, of equal importance is comprehensive, accurate discovery.  Building upon more than a decade of software development experience and analyzing SV in diverse disease contexts, we have invested significant effort into understanding the causes of the insufficient accuracy for SV discovery. These efforts, together with our research and development experience in this area, give us unique insight into improving the accuracy and scalability of SV discovery. Our goal is to narrow the accuracy gap between SNP/INDEL variation and structural variation discovery. These developments will empower studies of human genomes in diverse contexts and will therefore have broad impact. Our goals are to: 1. Develop a deep learning model to correct systematic variation in sequence depth. This new machine  learning model will correct systematic biases in DNA sequence depth and dramatically improve the  discovery of deletions and duplications. 2. Improve the speed, scalability, and accuracy of SV detection and genotyping. Using new algorithms,  we will bring the accuracy of SV detection much closer to that of SNP and INDEL discovery and allow  accurate SV discovery to be deployed at scale. 3. Create a map of genomic constraint for SV from population-scale genome analysis. We will deploy  our new methods to detect and genotype structural variation among tens of thousands of human genomes.  The resulting SV map will empower the creation of a model of genomic constraint for SV and enable new  software to predict deleterious SVs, especially in the noncoding genome. PROJECT NARRATIVE Single-nucleotide DNA changes paint an incomplete picture of a human’s genome. A more complete picture must include a genome's structural variation (SV), an important class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications. However, existing methods have poor accuracy. As the genetics community transitions to large-scale genome sequencing studies, there is an acute need for improved SV discovery methods. This proposal introduces a series of algorithmic and software innovations that will empower SV discovery, genotyping, and interpretation in large-scale human disease studies.",Scalable detection and interpretation of structural variation in human genomes,9973582,R01HG010757,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Clip', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Error Sources', 'Exhibits', 'Family Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Fusion', 'Gene Structure', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Paint', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reciprocal Translocation', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Systematic Bias', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'dosage', 'exome', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'method development', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'prevent', 'research and development', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'variant detection', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,692048,-0.011559687381632653
"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications.

"Novel approaches to map DNA replication traffic in a genome-wide scale PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish novel genomics and bioinformatics approaches to model patterns of DNA replication in cells. It is known that the patterns of DNA replication are intimately linked to the cell type. These differences between cell types are relevant to the integrity of the genome during cell type transitions. For example, we recently found that damage during DNA replication is increased during the induced transition from one cell type to another. However, there is a lack of methodology to observe replication patterns in human cells. DNA replication differs between different cell types in the location of initiation, the direction of fork progression, and the timing of initiation and completion. There is currently no method that can comprehensively map the progression of DNA replication to the genome. Because of the importance of DNA replication in cell proliferation, there is need for the development of such methods. To be able to examine the progression of DNA polymerases in human cells, we will develop a novel methodology to map DNA replication genome-wide, by incorporating nucleotide analogs during DNA replication, and sequencing the resulting DNA molecules by Nanopore sequencing and recording the electrical signals. In parallel, we will develop novel bioinformatics approaches to reliably examine the electrical signals and identify bases or regions of DNA replication, for comparison between different cell types, or between healthy and diseased tissues. Successful establishment of this technology will greatly increase our knowledge of replication, genetic stability and cell proliferation, and allow the community to characterize differences in the progression of DNA replication between cell types. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel genomic and bioinformatics methods to map how DNA is replicated in the human genome in different cells or different diseases. These methods will help us better understand patterns of DNA replication and genetic stability, ultimately yielding insights into cell proliferation in development, cancer and other diseases.",Novel approaches to map DNA replication traffic in a genome-wide scale,9923689,R21HG010165,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Asians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biological Process', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cultured Cells', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Markers', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA replication fork', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Names', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Price', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Replication Initiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'cell type', 'computational pipelines', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'electrical property', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'nanopore', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nucleotide analog', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'stem cell differentiation', 'tumor progression']",NHGRI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,205308,-0.0022879736086754278
"Development of methods for transcript quantification and differential expression analysis using long-read sequencing technologies. The rapid development of Third Generation, Long Read Sequencing (LRS) platforms such as Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have enabled increasing precision and higher-throughput sequencing of transcripts. Long reads can produce full-length transcript sequences, overcoming much of the uncertainty of short-read methods to accurately define transcripts, particularity for those genes with alternative splicing (more than 90% of human genes), for which short read sequencing has thus far proved difficult. LRS is therefore the natural choice for the study of the expression of transcript variants and of the role of alternative isoforms in disease and development. While the first iterations of the long-read technologies did not produce enough reads to quantify more than the highest expressed transcripts, the current sequencing depth of up to 8 million reads per SMRT cells on the Sequel 2 platforms promises reliable quantifiability for more modestly expressed genes. Also significant yield increases have been reported for Nanopore. This suggests that LRS may have reached sufficient throughput to enable accurate quantification of gene expression and differential expression analyses. LRS transcriptomics data have, however, specific properties that are absent in other transcriptomics technologies, such are partial matches of reference transcript models. Therefore specific methods for quantification and statistical analysis need to be developed. In this Project, we aim to characterize in detail the data distribution in long reads data, propose strategies to deal with their particular read uncertainty issues and develop new strategies for differential expression analysis. The overarching goal is to create the analytical framework to fully leverage LRS technologies for the study of isoform dynamics in relation of biomedical relevant questions. The goal of this project is to develop the SQANTI-QDE software, the first integral framework for the management of long read sequencing Iso-seq experiments. SQANTI-QDE will provide, in one tool, functionalities for the annotation and processing of multiple samples, improved definition of bona-fide transcripts, quantification of transcript expression, flexible creation of count matrices, data normalization, and differential expression and isoform usage analysis. Highly replicated, deep sequenced long read sequencing transcriptomics datasets will be created as part of this project.",Development of methods for transcript quantification and differential expression analysis using long-read sequencing technologies.,10041221,R21HG011280,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Ataxia', 'Awareness', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Heart', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Linear Models', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Orphan', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polyadenylation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'method development', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'preservation', 'sequencing platform', 'software development', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,405007,0.003802651904191385
"Single Cell Transcriptomic and Genetic Diversity by Single Molecule Long Read Sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY Defining the features of cellular mixtures, where diverse cell types with distinct genomic characteristics are physically intermingled together, is a central problem in biology. During the past decade, single cell sequencing technologies have enabled a new era of high throughput and high resolution interrogation of cell type diversity, vastly expanding our understanding of the role that cell types play in development and disease. Yet, current studies in single cell genomics rely on short-read sequencing and thus suffer from limitations, including: (1) Most studies rely on short read counting which limits the study of alternative splicing. (2) Cell states are reflected by static snapshots, and while population dynamics can be deduced through trajectory and RNA velocity estimation, robust estimation of these parameters remains a major challenge. (3) Despite advances in single-cell DNA sequencing, there is yet no cost-effective way to simultaneously characterize both the genetic variants and transcriptome-level changes in a cell, which is crucial for diseases such as cancer. This proposal is motivated by technological breakthroughs in single-molecule sequencing (SMS) and the recent adaptation of SMS to the massively parallel sequencing of single cell transcriptomes in our lab. We propose to develop computational methods to harness the power of SMS in single cell transcriptomics. In particular, we have developed a new genomic approach which allows one to repeatedly interrogate complete transcripts from single cells using SMS long reads, rather than 3' or 5' counting with short reads. This technology allows experimental designs where specific transcript subsets and/or cellular subsets can be repeatedly targeted for deeper joint short and long read analysis over many iterations, which we will exploit to conduct analyses that were previously intractable.

"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once. This will help scientists find important genetic features of canine cancers, match them to specific human cancers, and translate what we learn into new cancer therapeutics.",Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,9891974,R37CA218570,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Canis familiaris', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dog family', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Silicones', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Veterinarians', 'analysis pipeline', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'citizen science', 'classifier algorithm', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational cancer research', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R37,2020,653673,-0.05045426507073551
"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology. Results have the potential to lead to novel targeted therapy for atherosclerosis.",Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis,10004164,R01HL148109,"['Alanine', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Aorta', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Iowa', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Null Lymphocytes', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Threonine', 'Translating', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'calcification', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary plaque', 'dimer', 'genome editing', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oxidized low density lipoprotein', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,671017,-0.0160236780313116
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder.
