"Multi-color optical voltage imaging of neural activity in behaving animals Abstract Groundbreaking work within the NIH BRAIN Initiative has revealed many new types of neurons and their genetic signatures. The dividends from this research will include sophisticated tools allowing selective genetic access to these cell-types, such as for imaging, optogenetic or tracing studies. To complement these powerful genetic tools, it will be equally important to have new imaging techniques that can reveal how multiple neuron- types work together in the live brain to support information-processing and construct different brain states.  To address this challenge, Stanford University and The John B. Pierce Laboratory at Yale University will create optical techniques for imaging the concurrent voltage dynamics of up to 4 separate neuron-types in behaving animals. First, we will combine machine learning methods and an automated, high-throughput protein screening platform to engineer 4 different categories of genetically encoded fluorescent optical indicators of neuronal transmembrane voltage. We will then innovate several types of optical instruments tailored to work in conjunction with the new voltage indicators. These instruments will enable unprecedented studies of voltage rhythms and spiking dynamics in 2–4 genetically identified neuron-types in superficial and deep brain areas of awake behaving animals. One instrument will allow us to track the concurrent, population voltage oscillations of 2 neuron-types in freely behaving rodents. Another instrument, an optical mesoscope, will enable imaging studies of voltage waves and oscillations across the entire neocortical surface of behaving mice. A third device will be a high-speed miniature microscope for tracking neural dynamics at single cell-, single spike-resolution in freely behaving mice. Lastly, we will develop the capability to image with millisecond-scale precision the simultaneous spiking dynamics of 4 targeted neuron-types in either cortical or deep brain areas. Five external beta-tester labs will evaluate all these innovations in live mice and flies and provide critical user-feedback.  If our work succeeds, it will be a ‘game-changer’ for studies of brain dynamics, yielding vital knowledge about how different neuron-types synergize their dynamics to shape animal behavior and the brain’s global states in health and disease. To facilitate this outcome, we plan a 5-fold strategy for resource sharing: (i) All voltage-indicator constructs, viral vectors, transgenic flies, software and screening data will be deposited at public repositories for open distribution; (ii) All instrument designs will be published in extensive detail to facilitate replication; (iii) Our novel imaging devices will be integrated into an existing NIH-supported, publicly accessible facility for brain-imaging in rodents; (iv) In project years 2–4, we will conduct 4 training workshops for 40 visiting scientists per year (120 in total) to learn the new technologies firsthand. These visitors will also provide extensive user-feedback; (v) We will license our imaging instruments for commercial distribution.  Overall, we expect our project will lead to major conceptual advances in brain science and multiple new technologies that will reshape the practice of mammalian brain imaging. Project Narrative Prominent successes of the NIH BRAIN Initiative to date include the identification of many new types of neurons, but to understand how these cell-types work together in the live brain it will be crucial to have techniques that can record the coordinated voltage dynamics of multiple classes of identified neurons simultaneously. To create such techniques, we will engineer four novel fluorescent indicators of neuronal trans-membrane voltage and three new optical instruments tailored to use these indicators to image either the spiking or oscillatory voltage dynamics of up to four neuron-types concurrently in the brains of awake behaving animals. These innovations will reveal how multiple neuron-types act concertedly at the millisecond-scale to support information-processing and shape a wide range of neurophysiologic states.",Multi-color optical voltage imaging of neural activity in behaving animals,10166236,U01NS120822,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Fiber Optics', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Optical Instrument', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Visit', 'Work', 'absorption', 'awake', 'brain shape', 'cell type', 'design', 'fly', 'genetic signature', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging facilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning method', 'microendoscopy', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'public repository', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,875437
"Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rather than a dichotomy between health and pathology, many mental illnesses—especially depression and other mood disorders—are best conceptualized as the far end of a phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that characterizing individual differences in brain function and behavior will help further our understanding of disease. Existing work suggests that fMRI has the potential to predict individual behaviors from brain function, yet progress has been hindered by an overreliance on group studies (i.e., patients versus controls) and limited paradigms (i.e., either highly controlled tasks that risk being artificial, or at the other extreme, resting state, which is entirely unconstrained and difficult to interpret). Naturalistic fMRI, in which subjects do complex, engaging tasks such as watching films or listening to stories, offers an alternative that more closely mimics real-world cognition and may allow researchers to extract richer, more meaningful information from a single individual’s scan. As such, these paradigms are promising candidates for brain “stress tests” that would elicit patterns of brain activity that predict present or future behaviors. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to leverage existing large-scale datasets to develop methods to predict phenotypes from naturalistic fMRI data; (2) to design and conduct an fMRI study using targeted film stimuli to draw out individual variability of interest, specifically in traits related to depression; and (3) to extend the newly developed paradigms and analyses to a longitudinal study of a population at risk for depression and/or other mood disorders. Several innovative approaches to data analysis will be investigated. The central hypothesis is that brain activity evoked by these paradigms will vary across individuals in a continuous, multidimensional space that covaries with phenotype strength, that these relationships will be strong enough to predict phenotypes in unseen individuals, and that modified (e.g., attenuated) versions of patterns associated with illness will be detectable via these paradigms in those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded faculty member at a research-intensive university, with a research program exploring the basic cognitive neuroscience of individual differences in personality and cognition, as well as developing translational applications for psychiatry. To reach this goal, the training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s skills in the following areas: (1) applying machine learning techniques to predict individual-subject behavior from fMRI data; (2) conducting neuroimaging and behavioral research on depression and mood disorders with clinical and at-risk populations; and (3) gaining professional skills essential for a successful independent research career. The environment in which the career development will take place is the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, a vibrant community with outstanding resources to support the proposed project, including relevant courses and seminars, state-of-the-art facilities for MRI data acquisition and analysis, computing power, and expertise and guidance from senior scientists in neuroscience, engineering, machine learning and psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mental illness—especially depression and other mood disorders—is a massive burden on individuals, families and societies, yet psychiatrists lack brain-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This project seeks to fill that gap by conceptualizing mood disorders as the extreme end of a continuous phenotypic spectrum in the human population, and using functional brain imaging to study how individuals differ in their neural and behavioral responses to naturalistic, emotionally evocative stimuli. This project will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of individual variability related to mood disorders, and has the potential to lead to a “stress test” for psychiatry that would help identify at-risk individuals for earlier intervention.",Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum,10238174,R00MH120257,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Processes', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Normalcy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senior Scientist', 'Social Environment', 'Societies', 'Stimulus', 'Stress Tests', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'emotional stimulus', 'healthy volunteer', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R00,2021,249000
"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis,10162387,R01MH120174,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Motor', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protons', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adult', 'frontal lobe', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,759049
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10226122,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotional functioning', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,706855
"The Neuroscience of Everyday World- A novel wearable system for continuous measurement of brain function Innovations in human neuroimaging tools have driven profound advances in our understanding of brain function under well-controlled and constrained conditions. While we are gaining greater understanding of how the brain functions in single-snapshot experiments under restricted lab settings, we do not know how it works in dynamic, complex and multisensory real-world environments. The goal of this project is to build a portable, miniaturized, lightweight, high-density wearable combined – functional Near Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) – Electro-Encepholography (EEG) - Eye-tracking system for enabling “Neuroscience of the Everyday World (NEW)” by permitting long duration continuous monitoring of normal / altered brain activity during movement, perception, and social interaction in real time and in the real world. In Aim 1, We will (A) develop a wearable and fully hybrid high-density EEG-fNIRS system that supports autonomous long-term recordings (>6 hours), (B) develop combined and miniaturized active EEG-Electrodes / fNIRS-Optodes; and (C) integrate the wearable system with Tobii Pro 2 eye-tracking/scene-camera glasses and state- of-the-art computer vision for adaptive acquisition and automated data annotation. In Aim 2, we will measure brain activity during walking, perceiving, and interacting, with experiments gradually increasing in complexity through three phases from lab to real world settings in young healthy adults and conduct a proof of principle in two sample clinical populations. In Aim 3, we will create an analysis workflow for data collected in Aim 2 that will accomplish the following: (1) removing nuisance signals from fNIRS/EEG signals, (2) analysis of multimodal fNIRS/EEG and behavioral data, (3) automatic annotation of and adaptation for real world measurements. This project brings together engineers, scientists and clinicians with the goal of building the next generation of imaging tools to capture brain function in real time. With our technological sophistication, interdisciplinary focus, and ready access to well-characterized clinical populations, we are uniquely positioned to successfully develop, apply, and disseminate our NEW technology, and lay down a foundation upon which groundbreaking advances in our understanding of the links between brain activity and behavior will build. There is a need to link brain activity to human movement, perception and cognition, and social communication in real time, and in the Everyday World.

"Computational Diffusion MRI for Studying Early Human Brain Development Computational Diffusion MRI for Studying Early Human Brain Development Abstract In the ﬁrst years of life, the human brain develops dynamically in both structure and function. Many neurodevel- opmental disorders are associated with aberrations from normative growth during this critical period of early brain development. The increasing availability of longitudinal baby MRI data, such as those acquired through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP), affords unprecedented opportunity for precise charting of early brain developmental trajectories in order to understand normative and aberrant growth. Dedicated computational tools are needed for accurate processing and analysis of baby MR images, which typically exhibit dynamic heterogeneous changes across time. The goal of this project is to equip brain researchers with computational tools effective for studying the early developing human brain in terms of tissue microstructure and white matter pathways using diffusion MRI. We propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop computational tools for effective estimation of white matter pathways in the baby brain via diffusion tractography. We will tackle the challenge of tracking through regions with low diffusion anisotropy owing to ongoing myelination in the developing brain. Our tools will allow proper characterization of complex white matter pathway patterns such as fanning and bending. This will allow solving the gyral bias problem ubiquitous in existing tractography algorithms with ﬁber streamlines terminating predomi- nantly at gyral crowns but not sulcal banks. Our tools will allow tracing of cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical pathways with more uniform coverage of the cortex. In Aim 2, we will develop microstructural analysis meth- ods that are unconfounded by complex ﬁber conﬁgurations, such as crossing, bending, branching, kissing, and fanning, allowing more accurate and speciﬁc characterization of changes in tissue microarchitecture during early brain development. In Aim 3, we will develop techniques that will allow diffusion MRI data collected at multiple sites, which are very common in the era of big data, to be harmonized to mitigate the negative effects of inter-site variability. Unlike existing methods that harmonize derived quantities such as fractional anisotropy, our method can be applied directly to the diffusion-weighted images, allowing measurements based on microstructure and connectivity to be subsequently computed for consistent analysis. We will also develop deep learning tools for multi-shell data prediction so that diffusion MRI data collected with different numbers of shells can be harmonized. Successful completion of this project will empower the neuroscience community with computational tools to better chart the normative early development of the human brain using diffusion MRI. The developed tools will also enable quantitative brain examinations of children who are affected by neurological developmental disorders. Project Narrative This project will empower neuroscience researchers with robust computational tools needed to study the early developing human brain in terms of tissue microstructure and white matter connection pathways using diffusion MRI. We will develop tools to tackle challenges speciﬁc to analyzing infant diffusion MRI data, including (i) com- plex microstructure arising from the interweaving of differentially oriented neurites (axons and dendrites) in the context of the extracellular matrix; and (ii) complex white matter ﬁber geometries, such as crossing, bending, and fanning. We will also create tools to cater to the big-data era need of dealing with data from multiple imaging sites with potential discrepancies in acquisition protocols and scanner behaviors, allowing intra- and inter-site variability to be reduced via data harmonization for consistent analysis with signiﬁcantly boosted statistical power.",Computational Diffusion MRI for Studying Early Human Brain Development,10317389,R01MH125479,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Dental crowns', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Felis catus', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Neurites', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'North Carolina', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'critical period', 'data harmonization', 'deep learning', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'myelination', 'tool', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,456443
"Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome Project Summary In the healthy brain, large-scale white matter architecture and local neuronal membrane properties facilitate seamless transitions between cognitive states. Patients with schizophrenia display significant white matter abnormalities with disorganized brain activity. However, the degree to which dysfunctional brain activity in psychosis arises from structural or functional pathology remains unknown. The identification of conclusive neuroimaging findings in this cohort has been challenged by 1) inadequate methods to assess distributed multimodal pathological phenotypes, and 2) the significant pathogenetic heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Practically, the latter challenge can be in part addressed by the study of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), where the prevalence of clinical schizophrenia is 25-fold higher than that of healthy individuals. The former challenge can be addressed by recent advances in network science and machine learning, which have generated insights about structure-function relationships in the healthy brain. Utilizing these methods to study the spectrum of psychotic symptoms in a population with a defined genetic lesion is a promising direction for investigating psychosis pathophysiology. In this proposal, we describe the development of a novel time-point-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data to study structure-function relationships in a sample of patients with 22qDS currently being seen at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania. Using neuroimaging data from a large sample of youths (n = 690) acquired through the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structure, brain activity, and working memory performance. In this proposal, we aim to 1) compare brain state transition dynamics across the psychotic spectrum of 22qDS, 2) compare structure-function coupling in 22qDS to healthy controls and relate structure-function coupling to psychotic symptom severity, and 3) relate state transition dynamics to working memory performance in 22qDS. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of psychosis-spectrum symptoms would lay the groundwork for the development of targeted therapies for psychosis. Furthermore, utilizing a cohort with a known genetic lesion provides a unique opportunity to bridge our understanding of molecular mechanisms with neuroimaging biomarkers for psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Project Narrative Targeted, informed therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how complex patterns of brain activity arise from stationary white matter architecture. We propose to apply a novel method based on machine learning and network science to provide a new perspective on structure-function relationships in healthy controls as well as a sample of patients with psychosis secondary to chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Our study will leverage the presence of a consistent genetic lesion in this patient cohort to generate findings that could lay the groundwork for the development of interventions to restore healthy brain dynamics in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms.",Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,10092219,F30MH118871,"['22q11.2', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Occupational', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'University Hospitals', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'insight', 'learning network', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'preservation', 'psychotic symptoms', 'regional difference', 'selective attention', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2021,33126
"Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants. Project Summary Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) has revealed two major principles of the functional organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in human adults. First, some regions of VTC respond selectively to a specific category of stimuli, such as the fusiform face area (FFA) which responds more to faces than to any other stimulus category. The second principle of organization is that different categories of stimuli have systematically distinct patterns of response across the entire VTC. How do these two key aspects of VTC functional organization in adults arise in development? The goal of my research program is to discover if these organizing principles are present in the infant brain (Aims 1 and 2) and design computational models to test different theories of cortical development (Aim 3). The dissertation work in this proposal will provide invaluable data toward the goal of refining theories of cortical development. In addition to innovations that enhance the quality of awake infant fMRI data, Aim 1 provides the first evidence that like adults, infants have face-selective responses in the FFA, scene-selective responses in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), and body-selective responses in the extrastriate body area (EBA). Aim 2 directly follows this up by asking if infants have systematically distinct patterns of response across higher- level visual areas that are similar to those found in the adult brain. The F99 phase of this proposal will provide training to optimize machine learning (ML) techniques that can withstand the unique challenges of infant fMRI data – specifically unbalanced and missing data. The F99 phase will be conducted at MIT, an intellectual environment with access to leaders in the fields of ML, cognitive neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Finally, Aim 3 of this proposal is to build computational models designed to test current theories of cortical development. The K00 phase of this proposal will provide training on the design and implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) models as well as training on the best methods to test ANN models using infant fMRI data. Research for the K00 phase will provide a new mentorship experience with an established investigator in computational neuroscience and will take place at an institution with a thriving intellectual environment that has access to an MRI scanner and the computational resources necessary to build a variety of ANN models. In summary, the objective of the proposed research is to determine if the principles of functional organization in the adult brain are present in infants. Insights from this proposal will advance and refine theories of cortical development and have the potential to be applicable to other domains such audition and language. Further, by combining my predoctoral training in awake infant fMRI with my proposed postdoctoral training in computational modeling, the proposed research will enable me to become an independent investigator and leader in the field of computational developmental neuroscience. Project Narrative The last 20 years of cognitive neuroscience has revealed the functional architecture of the human brain with an exquisite degree of detail yet has left wide-open the question of what guides the precise development, organization, and structure of the human mind. This proposal outlines a plan to unify developmental cognitive neuroscience and computational cognitive neuroscience to uncover the starting state of the human visual system and how it develops. The proposed research stands to not only inform and refine theories of cortical development and inform our understanding of neurodevelopmental differences, but also has the potential to begin to unravel one of the most intriguing questions available to humanity: what are the origins of the human mind?",Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants.,10319402,F99NS124175,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Social Desirability', 'Social support', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computing resources', 'design', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning community', 'model design', 'object recognition', 'organizational structure', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'response', 'social cognition', 'social engagement', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'tool', 'vision development']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F99,2021,47036
"Center for Mesoscale Mapping Overview of the Proposed Resource – Abstract The goal of the Center for Mesoscale Mapping is to drive the convergence of microscopic- and macroscopic- scale evaluation of brain structure and function for human translational neuroscience, by developing and applying tools to study the spatial distribution and temporal orchestration of mesoscopic events in the human brain. Our Collaborators will, through a dynamic “push-pull” relationship, provide unique problems which drive the development of these tools, and in return guide us in the design and optimization of our toolbox for practical use in a variety of normal and disease settings. While there is still no formal consensus on the definition of mesoscopic within the neuroscience community, we take as our guide the spatial and temporal scales at which local groups of neurons act in coherent fashion – in the cortex, this includes the spatial scale of columns and laminar structures (between ~0.1-1 mm), while in deeper structures includes the myriad of deep brain and brainstem nuclei. Preliminary data from our own center, and of course others throughout the world, now support the notion that we are on the threshold of being able to map, measure and perturb the human brain at these scales, and do so comprehensively across wide swaths of the human brain. Temporally too, recent advances suggest a convergence between temporal scales addressable with tools like fMRI, which can now investigate delta frequency coherent phenomena, and advanced electromagnetic tools to measure and perturb coherent electrophysiological activity at higher frequencies still. With this convergence in mind, the tools we proposed to develop within the TRDs of the CMM will provide our Collaborative and Service User community with the important “missing links” between the advances in human cognitive neuroscience at the “system level,” and the enormous strides in cellular level circuit functional characterization. Our Collaborators will bring their own unique challenges to help us define and further refine these tools, offering problems requiring distinct measures of human brain structural and functional properties in a variety of normal and disease settings. Our Service Users will utilize our tools to better understand human neural systems, and particularly human disease states from multiple sclerosis to Alzheimer’s, to depression and epilepsy. Finally, our Center will seek to disseminate these tools, through open-source software and hardware designs, industrial partnerships and “hands-on” teaching courses for hardware, and to train a new generation of human neuroscientists in the use of our advanced tools to explore the human brain at this next frontier.

"Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface Project Summary: The long-term goal of this research is to develop a new, non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that will provide augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) capabilities to patients who have lost these capabilities due to severe motor impairments, such as completely locked-in syndrome (CLIS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and severe cerebral palsy (CP). The proposed research project will work towards a long-term goal by developing a BCI based on brain imaging signals from high-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT). Some existing BCIs record electroencephalography (EEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) signals from patients and then decode these signals into instructions for operating some element of the outside world, such as a cursor on a screen, a prosthetic limb, or a virtual keyboard. This functionality can enable communication. However, BCI generally has had limited success and capabilities in CLIS patients with EEG or has relied on invasive technology such as ECoG or intracortical recordings, which require surgical placement of electrodes on or beneath the brain surface. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has recently achieved great success with decoding items viewed or heard by subjects (e.g., distinguishing from among >100 viewed images), fMRI requires bulky, expensive equipment that cannot be employed for routine BCI for patients with severe motor- related communication deficits. In contrast, optical imaging approaches, such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), employ portable, wearable hardware. These optical systems are non-invasive and use non-ionizing, near-infrared light to create movies of blood oxygenation and therefore provide physiological information comparable to the fMRI signal. NIRS has recently been applied as an alternative to EEG BCI for decoding simple yes/no responses in CLIS patients. However, NIRS systems suffer from much-lower spatial resolution than fMRI, which renders NIRS unlikely to match the decoding capabilities of fMRI. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT) combines the lightweight, low-cost equipment benefits of EEG and NIRS with higher spatial resolution closer to that of fMRI at the brain surface. Recent advances in HDDOT systems have enabled average spatial localization errors <5 mm and spatial resolution <17-20 mm (substantially better than NIRS). Studies have demonstrated detailed maps of both visual and language tasks. These properties make HDDOT an ideal candidate tool for decoding brain function. The fellowship training will provide a strong foundation in optical neuroimaging methods, machine learning, and brain-computer interface. These experiences will prepare the applicant exceptionally well for a career in biomedical engineering research and for developing technology that will improve these patients’ quality of life. Project Narrative: This project will develop decoding methods and evaluate their feasibility for using a high- performance optical brain scanner to identify and distinguish between imaging tasks in human subjects. The long-term goal of this research is to enable locked-in patients to communicate with others using augmented communication facilitated by a portable brain-scanning device, and a computer that decodes their brain signals.",Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface,10078847,F31NS110261,"['Adult', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Clip', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Imagination', 'Instruction', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Literature', 'Locked-In Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'career', 'cost', 'density', 'diffuse optical tomography', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'light weight', 'mental imagery', 'motor impairment', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive system', 'optical imaging', 'portability', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,29520
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,10142533,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,843511
"Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation Project Summary  We are in critical need of targeted and individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affect nearly 50% of Americans during our lifetimes. Brain stimulation treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), represent the front-line of innovative approaches to correct dysfunctional brain networks for patients suffering from mental illness. rTMS is FDA-approved for depression and obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) with clinical trials underway for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use, among others. However, as currently administered, rTMS lacks a biomarker to individually optimize treatment and thus suffers from a poor clinical response rate (<50%). Without personalization of rTMS, we risk a one-size-fits-all treatment for all psychiatric disorders, not dissimilar to how antidepressants are administered.  Using simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), I identified a depression severity biomarker from a double-blind randomized clinical trial treating depressed patients with one month of active or placebo rTMS. The degree of this biomarker change significantly predicted clinical improvement after rTMS treatment. Direct brain recordings further suggest that a single stimulation session is sufficient to modulate this biomarker, indicating that this brain-based biomarker can be monitored daily to support empiric treatment optimization.  With this in mind, I propose to develop the first broadly generalizable platform for real-time biomarker monitoring (Aim #1) and personalized rTMS treatment (Aims #2 & 3). I will enroll 54 depressed patients to participate in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study directly comparing personalized, adaptive rTMS to standard rTMS. Primary outcome will be target engagement and dose-response of the depression severity biomarker. Successful implementation of this work includes the early stratification of treatment responders and personalized and more effective treatments for non-responders. This approach is broadly applicable to other depression biomarkers, all psychiatric populations treated with rTMS, and other brain stimulation modalities. More generally, my goals are to establish the fundamental principles of human brain plasticity and to construct platforms for rapid biomarker development, engagement, and integration into personalized brain stimulation treatments. Project Narrative We need targeted, individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affects nearly 50% of Americans. Brain stimulation treatments target dysfunctional brain networks with minimal side effects but are currently applied in a one-size-fits-all manner, thus limiting its efficacy. I aim to develop a non-invasive personalized brain stimulation platform for neuropsychiatric disorders; here I will create a real-time monitoring system for brain changes, evaluate the mechanism underlying these brain changes, and develop and test an adaptive stimulation paradigm to maximally drive individual brain changes and improve clinical outcome.","Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation",10020446,R01MH126639,"['Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Book Chapters', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Length', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinical predictors', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'journal article', 'lectures', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'placebo controlled study', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'real time monitoring', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'side effect', 'tenure track', 'time use', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment responders', 'treatment stratification']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,391250
"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology.

"Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Auditory WM dysfunctions are evidenced in individuals with speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as central auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Better understanding of auditory WM would help develop more precise biomarkers and targeted interventions for these deficits. Evidence for neuronal activation related to auditory WM patterns have been found in laboratory animals as well as in non- invasive human neuroimaging studies, both in auditory cortices (AC) and elsewhere in the brain. Recent human fMRI data also provide some evidence on item-specific activation patterns in ACs and frontal cortices. However, exactly where in the brain auditory WM content is stored and, more importantly, how the memorized information is represented is still unclear.  This research program pursues a better understanding of human auditory WM by attempting to infer its contents from the brain: Using state-of-the-art non-invasive neuroimaging and advanced signal-analysis methods we will search for cortical activation patterns that would predict item-specific WM information. We will examine brain function non-invasively with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional MRI (fMRI), and validate the findings using intracranial EEG (iEEG) measurements in presurgical patients. Recent studies suggest that, instead of persistent activation patterns, WM is supported by short-term synaptic facilitation, i.e., ""activity-silent"" population-level mechanisms. We hypothesize that these activity-silent representations could be decoded by analyzing the aftereffects of generic auditory ""impulse stimuli"" or TMS, which are utilized to ""ping"" the underlying cortical network during memory maintenance. We also hypothesize that although auditory WM likely involves co-operation of multiple brain regions, which are involved in articulatory-motor functions, perceptual categorization, or semantic processing, the retention of auditory-sensory attributes such as spectrotemporal modulation patterns critically depends on ACs. To examine WM of such auditory attributes, we will use tasks with dynamic ripple sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to human vocalizations but resist non-auditory processing strategies.  The major significance of this project is that it will increase the understanding of auditory WM, a crucial cognitive function whose neuronal bases have remained elusive. The results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in hearing and communication deficits as well as in disorders such as dyslexia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capacity to maintain and manipulate relevant sound information to support communication and problem solving. Our research program pursues a better theoretical understanding of this crucial cognitive function using advanced multimodal neuroimaging methods, validated using intracranial recordings in pre-surgical patients. Our results may also help develop more precise tools for characterizing auditory WM dysfunctions in speech perception disorders, language and reading impairments, and other disorders involving dysfunction of auditory cognition, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia.",Decoding parametric attributes of auditory working memories from human brain activity,10105316,R01DC016915,"['Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Problem Solving', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cortex mapping', 'electric field', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'operation', 'programs', 'semantic processing', 'sound', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,599963
"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",10087966,R01MH119421,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endoscopes', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Opsin', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Virus', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'data analysis pipeline', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fear memory', 'graph theory', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'neuronal excitability', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2021,337780
"Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging PROJECT SUMMARY Prevalent, morbid, and costly ($66 billion/year in 2007), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older adults, in whom the most common type is urgency incontinence (UUI). Generally ascribed to bladder spasms, UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The exciting findings suggest that one `phenotype' of UUI in older adults seems to be caused by a breakdown in brain control, which can be restored by successful behavioral therapy, while another is refractory. Our proposed new study will explore this further by attempting to differentiate the mechanisms associated with disease and aging. The goal is to identify which brain mechanisms should be suppressed because they are contributing to or causing UUI, which should be enhanced because they are helping to compensate for UUI, and which should be ignored because they are incidental to aging and not related to UUI. Current data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits that maintain continence by suppressing the voiding reflex in the midbrain. In our UUI phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism involved enhancing deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less activation of the second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to BFB, no brain changes were seen. Yet, although we have an emerging picture of the brain's role in UUI, we have only rudimentary understanding of what is `normal', i.e. how the brain normally controls the bladder. More relevant, we do not know whether this control mechanism is the same across the lifespan, or if it changes owing to the impact of aging. Thus, our overall aim is to characterize continence control in both young and old people, and examine how changes due to bladder control failure differ in each age group. Our specific aims are to characterize normal voiding in the continent old and young in order to better understand and verify the working model and to use the comparison to older adults with UUI to understand the mechanism of brain failure in these individuals. To address these aims, we will conduct a detailed clinical and neuroimaging study to study 80 asymptomatic women and 80 UUI women, each group divided equally into young (18-45) and old (65+ years). The study will enable us to evaluate the changes in brain structure and function and to identify brain mechanisms involved in continence control, changes due to aging (both benign and contributory to UUI), and changes due to disease. The study will provide the comprehensive data on brain mechanisms involved in the normal continence mechanism in order to better corroborate our working model, understand the aging process, and assess targets for therapy. It will thereby enable scientists to develop novel and more effective new therapies based on the revolution in neuroscience—and more hope for UUI sufferers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Urge urinary incontinence is a common problem in older people which vastly reduces quality of life, yet the cause and mechanism of disease are not well understood. This study will characterize brain control of the bladder in young and old continent individuals and age-matched wet counterparts. This will expand our current knowledge of how the brain controls the bladder, better characterize the `ideal' mechanism and suggest ways in which we can better target treatment.",Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging,10263175,R01AG065288,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Biofeedback', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Control', 'Bladder Dysfunction', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Incontinence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Micturition Reflex', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Premenopause', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Refractory', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Spasm', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Urge Incontinence', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Woman', 'age group', 'age related', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'innovation', 'micturition urgency', 'mind control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,612748
"The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk Abstract  Individual differences in brain structure, including cortical morphology and the white matter connectome are associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. The first year of life is a period of rapid and dynamic structural and functional brain development and new data from our cohort suggests that a large portion of individual differences in brain structure in 10 and 12 year olds is already present in the first year or two of life. Early adolescence and puberty is the second major period of postnatal brain development, characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain maturation and reorganization, and emerging risk for psychiatric disorders, though it is not known how this period of development contributes to individual differences in brain structure and risk. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a unique and innovative longitudinal study that has followed children, enrolled prenatally, with imaging and cognitive/behavioral assessments at birth, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years. 482 children from this cohort are now reaching adolescence, and we propose to follow these children at 12, 14 and 16 years of age. MRIs, including structural, diffusion tensor, and resting state functional imaging, will be performed. Cognitive and behavioral development will be assessed, with a focus on the phenotypes of executive function, attention, and anxiety, consistent with RDoC constructs important for psychiatric disorder risk. We will determine how adolescent brain development contributes to individual differences in relation to early childhood development and whether the white matter connectome is a useful early imaging biomarker. Knowledge gained in this study will improve our basic understanding of human brain development, and ultimately inform early intervention strategies that prevent or mitigate risk and illness severity. Relevance New knowledge gained in this study will provide a dramatically improved framework for understanding childhood brain development and its relationship to cognitive and behavioral outcomes in adolescence, and to risk for subsequent psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative For years it has been hypothesized that psychiatric disorders are the result of abnormal trajectories of childhood brain development, though there is little direct evidence to support that hypothesis. The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a longitudinal study that has followed children with imaging and developmental assessments from birth to age 10 years. We will study brain structure and function in these children at 12, 14, and 16 years with MRI to see if we can identify childhood predictors of behavior in adolescence that is considered at risk for psychiatric illness, which will ultimately help target periods of childhood development for early intervention.",The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk,10206731,R01MH123747,"['10 year old', '12 year old', '16 year old', '4 year old', '8 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Puberty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'adolescent brain development', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain abnormalities', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'disorder risk', 'early adolescence', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'executive function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'postnatal period', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'sex', 'social', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,763760
"Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution Project Summary A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of brain cells and their brain-wide organization is essential for interrogating human brain function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward mapping brain cells through various lenses, which have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, integrative extraction of the multimodal properties of various cell-types brain-wide within the same brain, crucial to elucidating complex intercellular relationships, remains nearly impossible. We have developed high-throughput, cost-effective technology platforms to create a fully integrated three-dimensional (3D) human brain cell atlas by simultaneously mapping high-dimensional features (e.g., spatial, molecular, morphological, and microenvironment information) of all cells acquired from the same whole brain. The proposed work will establish the most comprehensive 3D human brain map to date, with unprecedented resolution and completeness. We envision that this atlas will facilitate the integration of a broad range of studies and allow the research community to interrogate human brain structure and function at multiple levels. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel technology to transform whole human brain tissue into indestructible hydrogel–tissue hybrids that allow highly multiplexed molecular labeling and subcellular-resolution volume imaging. In Aim 2, we will apply scalable labeling and imaging technologies to map the brain-wide 3D distribution of various cell-type and structural markers at subcellular resolution within the same brain. Our chemical engineering–based approach to this aim will enable cost-effective, lossless 3D labeling of the entire human brain at lower cost as traditional subsampling approaches. True volume labeling and subcellular-resolution imaging will allow us to extract fine morphological and connectivity information from labeled cells and reconstruct the microenvironment of all cells. In Aim 3, we will use a host of rapid and highly automated algorithms to perform unbiased, integrative high- dimensional phenotyping of all cells based on their spatial location, molecular expression, morphology, and microenvironment. In Aim 4, we will perform super-resolution phenotyping of cells in a selected brain region from the same sample used in Aim 3 to map inter-areal axonal connectivity at single-fiber resolution and to characterize chemical synapses. This integrative approach will likely unveil unique cell-types and brain regions, a crucial step toward a better understanding of brain function. The complete 3D dataset will be linked to magnetic resonance and diffusion spectrum images and existing reference atlases to facilitate the integration of a wide breadth of study at multiple levels and to make the data publicly accessible for mining and analysis. A detailed picture of the human brain’s complex intermolecular, intercellular, and interareal interactions is of paramount importance for understanding its function and dysfunction. However, the immense complexity of the human brain and the absence of enabling technologies have hither-to made it impossible to interrogate these interactions brain-wide. Here we propose to use a host of new technology platforms to create a fully integrated whole human brain cell atlas with unprecedented levels of resolution and completeness.",Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution,10168641,U01MH117072,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Chemical Synapse', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Fiber', 'Formalin', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'antibody libraries', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'lens', 'macromolecule', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'spectrograph', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2021,1691053
"OpenScope: A Platform for High-Throughput and Reproducible Neurophysiology Open to External Scientists to Test Impactful Theories of Brain Function Project summary Over the past five years, the Allen Institute has built two unique in-house pipelines for in vivo electro- and optical-physiology: together they form the Allen Brain Observatory. We used this observatory to freely and openly share calcium imaging data from ~60,000 cells from 221 running mice viewing standard visual stimuli; in October 2019, we will release Neuropixels electrophysiology recordings from ~100,000 cells from 100 mice under the same conditions, all registered to a common anatomical coordinate system (CCFv3). We wish to open the Brain Observatory pipeline to the community, enabling theoretical, computational, and experimental scientists to test sophisticated hypotheses on brain functions in a process analogous to astronomical observatories that survey the night sky. Our observatory, called OpenScope, will accept, once a year, experimental proposals from external scientists, which will be reviewed by a panel of leading experts for their feasibility and scientific merit. The Allen Institute will carry out the selected experiments by following verified, reproducible, and open protocols for in vivo single- and multi-area two photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels electrophysiology, making the data freely available to these scientists. Funding for this proposal will give the entire community access to a modern experimental platform that operates under standardized, reproducible, and high-throughput conditions. This resource will be particularly attractive to the computational and theoretical communities with limited access to experimental facilities. Our project has the potential to transform systems neuroscience by implementing an observatory model that has been tremendously successful in other scientific fields. By reducing variability in training, imaging and quality control across animals and experiments and by lowering the barrier to select, test, and validate the best ideas, we hope to accelerate progress toward an integrated view of neural circuits. Project narrative Scientific fields such as astronomy and particle physics have had tremendous success using an “observatory” based approach to data collection, in which researchers propose experiments to be carried out in centralized facilities too complex and expensive to be operated by individual laboratories. We will apply this model to neuroscience by opening the Allen Institute Brain Observatory’s state-of-the-art optical and electrophysiological data collection pipelines to the entire neuroscience community. This will lower barriers to testing new hypotheses about brain function, bring in new computational and theoretical talents into the field, and enhance the reproducibility of results in brain research, thereby accelerating progress toward an integrated understanding of neural activity in health and disease.",OpenScope: A Platform for High-Throughput and Reproducible Neurophysiology Open to External Scientists to Test Impactful Theories of Brain Function,9967446,U24NS113646,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Astronomy', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Silicon', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Talents', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'data acquisition', 'data format', 'data standards', 'design', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'imaging platform', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual stimulus', 'web portal']",NINDS,ALLEN INSTITUTE,U24,2021,1501246
"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,10173577,R01AG017917,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Autopsy', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-3', 'base', 'data hub', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'human model', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'neuropathology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sex', 'therapeutic target', 'trait']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,3008531
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, and involves a complicated interplay between functional infor- mation interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. functional and structural measures. However, the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities misses a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimen- sional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we devel- oped advanced approaches to capture high-dimensional relationships among 2 or more modalities. Our work continues to strongly support the benefits of multimodal data fusion to both provide a more complete picture of brain function and structure, but also to improve our ability to study and predict the impact of complex mental illness. In this new phase of the project, we will focus on methods that can fill some existing gaps, such as the ability to bridge spatial/temporal as well as structural/functional connectivity scales. We also propose a novel framework to integrate unimodal and multimodal features called chromatic fusion, which searches for combina- tions of multimodal `notes' which occupy a unique position in a latent (or dictionary) space. The proposed meth- ods will be validated using simulations, hybrid-data, and large N normative imaging data. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly tested using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symp- toms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression). We will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via GitHub and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 37 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and our work has clearly shown the substantial benefits of ex- tracting multimodal features estimated jointly from the data. In this renewal, we focus on some key understudied areas including fusing across vast spatiotemporal and functional/structural connectivity scales as well as devel- oping powerful new frameworks for integrating the resulting information to enable decision making and enable identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. Completion of our aims will result in a powerful new toolkit for data fusion of multimodal brain imaging data. 36",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,10226356,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data fusion', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,510918

The proposed technology integration and dissemination resource will provide the neuroscience community with technical help to obtain and manage large scale data, broadening the access to and incorporation of high throughput multiscale imaging tools and leading-edge analysis strategies in their studies. Richly integrated resources will be offered, including molecular probes, imaging platforms and data analysis tools certain to enable and hasten brain research. The types of research projects we will support, include: 1) investigations requiring the traversal of spatiotemporal scales to reveal new insight and understanding of specific neural populations; 2) investigations which aim to mark and track neuronal processes and/or visualize targeted connectomes of local circuits within large volumes of nervous tissue in multiple animal models; 3) projects which seek to perform nano-histological assessment of cellular and subcellular level alterations associated with learning, physiological state, or disease; and 4) projects performing higher resolution 3D morphometric analysis of subcellular underpinnings of function, with particular emphasis on synaptic function as influenced by subcellular constituents. This new center will leverage an administrative framework and information technology cyberinfrastructure which is already in place and has been refined over many years. In addition to providing a management structure, this framework includes a community outreach, project review, selection, and onboarding process refined and long practiced by the PI (and the assembled team). Additional mechanisms for tool/technology dissemination and training, data management and sharing, and mechanisms for cost-recovery and long-term sustainability will also be leveraged and expanded so as to maximize the reach and impact of our technologies and resources.

"ENIGMA World Aging Center ABSTRACT One in three seniors dies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or another dementia - diseases that cost the nation $259 billion, to rise to $1.1 trillion by 2050 (Alzheimer's Association, 2017). Despite the vast personal and economic cost of these diseases, two major barriers stall efforts to discover key biological mechanisms that influence brain aging. First, the sheer cost of data collection means that most national initiatives have limited power to detect factors that affect brain aging. Even in datasets of N=1,000+ people (e.g., ADNI) – the power to discover modulators of brain aging is limited and may not generalize worldwide. Second, with the crisis of reproducibility, we do not always know if a finding will replicate; and if not, if this is due to true population heterogeneity or problems with methods. ENIGMA offers a coordinated global approach to solve these problems. ENIGMA's World Aging Center is a global brain aging study that builds on our vast and highly productive ENIGMA consortium - a global network of 340 institutions in 45 countries. ENIGMA published the largest-ever genetic studies of the brain (Nature 2017; Science 2020), and the largest neuroimaging studies of 5 major psychiatric disorders. ENIGMA's World Aging Center is a concerted global effort to pool all available data, methods, expertise and capital infrastructure to discover factors that affect brain aging. Our long-term goal is to identify personalized biological predictors of brain structural and functional decline and assess how they generalize globally. We have 4 aims: Aim 1: ENIGMA-Lifespan. Develop Lifespan Charts for Brain and Neural Tract Aging in 20,000 people. We will create charts showing how MRI brain measures change throughout life in 20,000 people, aged 1-92. We will compute a composite brain aging score, `Brain Age', from available MRI, DTI, rsFMRI data, that measures how much the brain deviates from expected values, for a person's age and sex. Aim 2: ENIGMA-Epigenetics. Relate genome-wide methylation levels to brain metrics in 10,000+ people, to discover epigenetic markers of accelerated brain aging. We discovered 2 epigenetic loci promoting brain aging in pilot studies. We will compute a “epigenetic clock” and test if it predicts brain metrics better than simple biological age. Aim 3: ENIGMA-Plasticity. Discover genomic loci that promote or mitigate brain tissue loss, in > 37 worldwide cohorts with longitudinal MRI. Aim 4: ENIGMA-Alzheimer's Disease (New Aim). Meta-analyze the role of APOE, AD polygenic risk, and a new risk score for accelerated atrophy on neuroimaging biomarkers in aging and AD, including amyloid and FDG PET. These aims seek to analyze worldwide imaging, epigenetic, and clinical data with harmonized methods. We aim to create new aging “clocks” and reveal targetable risk factors and modifiers of brain aging in the genome and epigenome, test how and when they shift AD biomarkers, and test their generalizability worldwide. NARRATIVE To address reproducibility and power issues in aging and Alzheimer's disease research, we launch ENIGMA's World Aging Center, a global brain study of aging and AD across 45 countries. Leveraging our ENIGMA network (340 institutions), we launch 4 coordinated projects to empower genetic and epigenetic studies of brain aging: (1) Enigma-Lifespan- creates normative charts of brain aging metrics from MRI, diffusion imaging, and functional MRI in 20,000 people worldwide; (2) ENIGMA-Epigenetics- relates genome-wide methylation to brain aging; (3) ENIGMA-Plasticity- seeking genetic loci affecting brain atrophy rates; and (4) ENIGMA-Alzheimer's- to identify how Alzheimer's genetic risk and new risk scores for accelerated tissue loss, affect the brain. We will analyze worldwide imaging, epigenetic, and clinical data with harmonized methods, to create new aging “clocks” and reveal targetable risk factors and modifiers of brain aging in the genome and blood, worldwide.",ENIGMA World Aging Center,10119038,R01AG058854,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Amyloid', 'Atrophic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Capital', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cost of Illness', 'Country', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Educational Status', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Carriers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guanine', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Priorities', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nomograms', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Problem Solving', 'Proxy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tract', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'economic cost', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'executive function', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'functional decline', 'genome wide association study', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'global health', 'glucose metabolism', 'hazard', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging genetics', 'indexing', 'inorganic phosphate', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural tract', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'polygenic risk score', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'sex', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,696496
"Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. Edilberto Amorim is a neurologist with subspecialty training in critical care and epilepsy who aims to employ biomedical technology innovations in brain monitoring to personalize treatment for patients with hypoxic- ischemic brain injury post-cardiac arrest. This career development award and its rigorous curriculum will establish Dr. Amorim as a clinician-scientist with independent expertise in: 1) Deep learning applied to physiology time-series, 2) Causal inference for observational data, and 3) Quantitative brain imaging. Every year, more than 500,000 Americans have a cardiac arrest. Brain injury is the number one cause of death for patients surviving initial resuscitation, and refractory seizures and other seizure-like brain activity are diagnosed in up to 50% of patients. Despite being a common complication, outcomes are dismal and current treatment strategies for seizures post-cardiac arrest are limited. Dr. Amorim aims to identify physiology-driven biomarkers of resilience to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury by utilizing state-of-the-art computational methods and a massive EEG and neuroimaging dataset with >1,500 subjects. His central hypothesis is that specific time- dependent changes in spike and accompanying EEG activity during cardiac arrest treatment predict seizure control and, ultimately, neurological recovery. The primary objectives of this proposal are: 1) Identify early longitudinal epileptiform EEG phenotypes predictive of neurological recovery using interpretable and deep learning algorithms; 2) Establish quantitative EEG biomarkers of seizure treatment response to anesthetics; and 3) Estimate the causal effect of rapid seizure treatment with anesthetics in preventing structural brain injury quantified with brain MRI. Dr. Amorim has generated preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling EEG phenotypes longitudinally for outcome prediction and has applied quantitative EEG biomarkers to predict degree of brain injury on brain MRI. His primary mentor in this proposal will be Dr. Edward Chang, a neuroscientist and leader in human neurophysiology research. His co-mentors will include Dr. Brandon Westover, an authority in machine learning applied to critical care EEG, and Dr. Donna Ferriero, an accomplished translational and neuroimaging investigator in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Additional mentoring in quantitative neuroimaging (Dr. Srikantan Nagarajan) and biostatistics (Dr. Charles McCulloch) will be essential components of his training. These aims are expected to establish early non-invasive predictive biomarkers of neurological recovery and seizure control that may: 1) Guide patient selection for clinical trials enrichment and 2) Serve as target to therapeutic interventions after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. By leveraging the deep expertise of a cross-disciplinary group of world-class mentors and the unparalleled innovation environments of the University of California, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Dr. Amorim will be ideally positioned to uncover fundamental knowledge about epileptogenesis after acute brain injury as well as spearhead clinical trials focused on improving outcomes meaningful to cardiac arrest patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiac arrest impacts the lives of 500,000 Americans every year, and nearly half of patients surviving the initial resuscitation will develop seizures or seizure-like brain activity as a complication of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We aim to reduce secondary brain injury and neurological disability from seizures after cardiac arrest by personalizing seizure treatment using EEG and brain MRI biomarkers of neuro-recovery. We expect that the outcome of the proposed studies will provide critical knowledge about epileptogenesis after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury andguide the development of goal-directed seizure treatment and patient selection in future clinical trials.",Physiology-driven seizure management post-cardiac arrest,10105883,K23NS119794,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'American', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Complication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intervention Trial', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Propofol', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resuscitation', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomarker-driven', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural hypothermia', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological recovery', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'resilience', 'response biomarker', 'skills', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trend']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,191538
"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,10194380,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mental function', 'mental state', 'neural network classifier', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'system architecture']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,38222
"Diagnosis of indeterminate brain lesions using MRI-based machine learning and polygenic risk models PROJECT SUMMARY In 2017 an MRI was performed at a rate of over one for every 10 US residents. The majority of these were brain MRIs. Indeterminate mass lesions are present on over 1% of brain MRIs in individuals over 45 years old. Misinterpretation of brain MRI can lead to significant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. For example, tumefactive Central Nervous System Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease (CNSIDD) is commonly misdiagnosed as a malignancy, even following pathological review. This results in inappropriate brain biopsies, debulking and radiation. While early tumor resection is associated with favorable outcome in patients with high- grade glioma, observation, biopsy at an alternate site or nonsurgical options are often more appropriate for other indeterminate mass lesions that can encompass low-grade primary brain tumor, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastasis. Thus, to prevent iatrogenic morbidity, there is a critical need for scalable and reproducible methods to distinguish CNSIDD from other brain lesions, and to accurately diagnose brain tumors prior to biopsy. We recently published a polygenic risk model demonstrating that the 25 known glioma germline risk variants can estimate absolute and lifetime glioma risk. The clinical significance of these models is driven by germline variants that are associated with >4-fold increased risk of glioma. We have also shown that the same 25 germline variants can predict glioma molecular subtype. As a complementary approach, we have shown that imaging characteristics differ across glioma, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastases. We have successfully utilized MRI-based machine learning to predict the molecular subtype in high-grade glioma. We hypothesize that both germline genotyping and MRI-based machine learning provide an opportunity to diagnose indeterminate mass lesions as well as predict glioma molecular subtype prior to surgery and thus personalized treatment. The project has the following three aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a MRI-based machine learning model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases of unknown primary. Aim 2: Evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the polygenic glioma risk model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases. Aim 3: Integrate the polygenic glioma subtype model and MRI-based machine learning model to predict adult diffuse glioma molecular subtype and validate the integrated model using a prospective cohort. The proposed project will further enhance the care of patients by determining if an early MRI lesion is actually a glioma. Early definitive surgery in these patients could be curative.

"Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis Abstract: Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of cancer progression and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancer patients worldwide. There is at present no translational approach to detect if a primary tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of technology that can classify a cancer cell’s brain metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; therefore, we propose a diagnostic platform to measure the phenotypic differences between cancer cells and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. The output is a quantitative diagnostic read out that defines the probability of a patient's cell metastasizing to the brain. Preliminary data suggests we may use this platform to brain metastatic behavior in 24-72 hrs. We have demonstrated that we can classify non-brain seeking and brain seeking cell lines based on phenotypic metrics such as migration, extravasation, shape and volume with a positive predictive value of 0.9. This study will validate the performance of this platform on patient cells. Further we aim to understand what components of the brain stromal space promote brain metastasis to further improve the performance of this technology and identify candidates that could be targeted by therapeutics to prevent metastasis in patients that have been identified as at risk. In summary, we propose a unique approach to measure the individual metastatic potential of tumor cells spatially and temporally. This work will result in both improved clinical stratification and, downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis from breast and other primary sites. Public health narrative: This grant would help develop a new clinical approach to predicting the progression of primary cancer into brain metastasis. This is the most lethal complication of breast cancer. Preventing this would save lives and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year.",Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis,10109103,R21CA245597,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast cancer metastasis', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Extravasation', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer cell', 'cancer complication', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'diagnostic technologies', 'experience', 'histological slides', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'indexing', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'operation', 'organ on a chip', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tomography', 'translational approach', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2021,182325
"Clear Volume Imaging with Machine Learning: a novel tool to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse in rat models This project is in response to PA-18-437 “Cutting-Edge Basic Research Awards (CEBRA)”. Over the two past decades, there has been a large increase in the abuse of prescription and illegal opioids; this increase coincides with increases in opioid-related deaths. A critical challenge is the occurrence of relapse in treated patients, especially given that relapse episodes carry a risk of overdose. There is a need to improve our understanding of the brain mechanisms of opioid relapse, which hopefully will result in the identification of targeted circuitry-based treatments. We propose to develop a high-throughput computation system termed Clear Volume Analysis with Machine Learning (CVA-ML). We will combine CVA-ML with a rat-optimized version of the whole brain immunostaining and clearing method iDISCO+ and a new rat model of opioid relapse after voluntary abstinence to identify brain- wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse. We recently adapted the iDISCO+ method to intact rat brains and developed experimental methods for Fos immunostaining, brain clearing, and light sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging. However, incorporation of the iDISCO+ method to large scale rat studies is currently limited by (1) lack of ABA-CCF-comparable high-resolution 3D rat brain atlas that allows for high-resolution registration of the activity signal in the 3D space, and (2) lack of an automated data analysis pipeline. In Aim 1, we propose to develop a data analysis pipeline that will take light sheet fluorescence microscopy- generated rat brain images and automatically register them into a custom-made 3D rat brain atlas encompassing a converted Paxinos and Watson rat’s brain atlas. As part of Aim 1, we also propose to develop machine-learning methods to identify and analyze the whole brain Fos signals in 3D space. In Aim 2, we propose to use the methods we developed in Aim 1 to identify brain-wide patterns of neuronal activity (‘neural ensembles’) that encode opioid relapse after voluntary abstinence induced by imposing adverse consequences (electric barrier) that results in long-term cessation of opioid (oxycodone) self-administration. Our proposal addresses the goal of PA-18-437: “to develop, and/or adapt, revolutionary techniques or methods for addiction research.” The anticipated outcomes of our proposal are an open-source software package to automatically analyze iDISCO+ data of rat brains, and a rat whole brain activity map for opioid relapse, assessed using a new rat model. The publicly available software will be easy to modify and can be used by investigators to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles underlying drug relapse and other motivated behaviors in rats. Project Narrative This project seeks to develop a high-throughput computation system and combine it with the whole brain clearing method iDisco+ and a novel rat model of relapse after voluntary abstinence opioid relapse model to identify brain-wide neuronal ensembles of opioid relapse.

"MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION Critical developments in neuroscience have included technologies for sequencing individual brain cells, progress towards completing a full mesoscale brain cell atlas in mice, new tools for monitoring and manipulating the activity of brain cells, refined imaging techniques for developing structural and functional connectome atlases in humans, and new objective measures for characterizing behavior across species. Nevertheless, a critical gap that has yet to be addressed is the development of a model that would allow this emerging catalog of cellular information to be linked to the broad functional networks that encode emotional behavior in mammals. This gap exists in part because 1) technologies that measure, monitor, and decode mesoscale activity throughout the depth of the brain during free behavior in mammalian model species have yet to be implemented in conjunction with cellular activity can be monitored and manipulated, and 2) theoretical frameworks that link cellular activity to mesoscale network activity and that generalize across subjects on a mouse-by-mouse basis have yet to be developed. Our multi-disciplinary team has built a suite of tools for studying how brain dynamics encode complex brain states. These include advanced techniques to measure and monitor brain dynamics in vivo concurrently for months across many regions located throughout the depth of the brain at high spatiotemporal resolution in freely-behaving mice, machine-learning analytic approaches that build individual circuit activity measures into composite networks, behavioral manipulations that can be used to induce brain states related to emotions, viral methods that probe the relationship between cellular changes and the expression of brain-wide neural dynamics, and closed-loop stimulation tools that can potentially test the causality of brain network-states in mediating emotion. By integrating this suite of tools in a single framework, we intend to create a model that will catalogue how the brain generates aggression. Critically, we believe that this model framework will be broadly applicable to other emotional brain states as well. Many cortical and subcortical brain regions work together to coordinate social emotional brain states. In this study we propose to build a model from experimental data that explains how these regions work together to generate aggression. We will test this model using established and emerging therapeutics utilized to treat aggression in the clinic, and we will develop new brain stimulation methodologies to regulate aggressive brain states uncovered by our model.",MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION,10124784,R01MH125430,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Agonist', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Models', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Guanfacine', 'Habenula', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Instinct', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Music', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating System', 'Output', 'Oxytocin', 'Peptides', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Network', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Vision', 'Work', 'brain cell', 'cellular targeting', 'connectome', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'emotional behavior', 'experimental study', 'free behavior', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'instrument', 'machine learning method', 'millisecond', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuroregulation', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensorimotor system', 'social', 'spatial integration', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,304597
"Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram Project Abstract: Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram Although cognitive decline is a “normal” part of aging, some individuals clearly age better than others. However, the concept of differential aging has been minimally studied for the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations signals carry rich information regarding brain health and brain aging. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with fragmented sleep and altered sleep oscillations. Clearance of cerebral beta amyloid through the brain's glymphatic drainage system occurs mainly in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and depends on EEG slow oscillations. Cortical generators of sleep EEG oscillations overlap with regions of cortical thinning and loss of functional connectivity in AD. Disturbances of NREM disrupt memory consolidation. Finally, deficient REM sleep contributes to dementia. These observations suggest that brain health may be measurable from information contained in the sleep EEG. In preliminary work we have developed EEG-brain age – a machine learning model that predicts a patient's age based on patterns of overnight sleeping EEG oscillations. This allows prediction of age with a precision of +/- 7 years. Our preliminary data suggest diabetes and hypertension, chronic HIV infection, an MCI or AD are reflected in the EEG as excessive brain age, and that excessive brain age is independently associated with reduced life expectancy. Our central hypothesis is that sleep physiology data can provide sensitive and specific biomarkers of brain health. This hypothesis is based on our prior work showing that BAI is elevated in several clinical populations. BAI can be accurately calculated using frontal EEG signals, making it suitable for implementation on at-home EEG devices. The rationale for the proposed research is that validating sleep EEG-derived biomarkers as measures of brain health at the level of individual patients would lay the ground for use in clinical trials and patient care. We plan to accomplish the central objective by pursuing two complementary aims. In Aim 1, we will take a hypothesis-driven approach, and test for associations of specific sleep features with specific cognitive deficits and specific structural pathology. In Aim 2, we will take ad data-driven approach, and develop optimized biomarkers of brain health using a novel form of machine learning known as multitask learning, which combine multiple features of sleep – including conventional features, as well as data-driven features directly learned from the data – to predict or “explain” variation in cognitive performance and in structural brain MRI measures that are indicative of brain health or disease. The project will take advantage of a large and diverse set of sleep data (>33,000 patients), as well as thousands of brain MRI and cognitive testing results. At the conclusion of this study, we expect to have a better understanding of the role sleep oscillations play in brain health, and clinically useful brain health biomarkers. These outcomes will aid development of interventions to promote brain health. Project Narrative: Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram RELEVANCE: Loss of brain function including memory and executive function is an inevitable part of aging, yet some individuals' brains age better than others. We recently developed the brain age index – a statistical model that reports the difference between an individual's apparent brain age, based on the pattern of overnight EEG (brain waves), and their chronologic age. This project will use existing data from 4 large cohorts to further develop and validate sleep EEG-based biomarkers of brain health, by characterizing the relationships of brain waves during sleep to cognitive health and to the structural health of the brain.",Establishing a Brain Health Index from the Sleep Electroencephalogram,10180268,RF1NS120947,"['20 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Archives', 'Arousal', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Pathology', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Claustral structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drainage procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'General Hospitals', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Koreans', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'REM Sleep', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Smoker', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'basal forebrain', 'base', 'brain health', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'functional loss', 'glymphatic system', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multi-task learning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'sleep physiology', 'sleep spindle', 'specific biomarkers', 'therapy development']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,RF1,2021,2494802
"Mapping the superficial white matter connectome of the human brain using ultra high resolution multi-contrast diffusion MRI Abstract In this 5-year R01 project entitled “Mapping the superficial white matter connectome of the human brain using ultra high resolution multi-contrast diffusion MRI,” we propose to create the first atlas of the human brain’s superficial white matter (SWM) using sub-millimeter ultra high resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI). The SWM is located between the deep white matter and the cortex. It plays an important role in neurodevelopment and aging, and it has been implicated in a large number of diseases including Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Despite its significance in health and disease, the SWM is vastly underrepresented in current descriptions of the human brain connectome. The SWM contains short, u- shaped association fiber bundles called u-fibers. Multiple challenges have thus far prevented comprehensive mapping of the human brain’s SWM. These challenges include the inadequate spatial resolution of dMRI data, which prevents u-fiber tracing using current tractography methods, as well as the small size, high curvature, and high inter-subject variability of the u-fibers. An additional challenge is the lack of ground truth information. Our understanding of human neuroanatomy relies heavily on the results of invasive tracer studies in monkeys, but the detailed neuroanatomy of the SWM in monkeys has not yet been systematically compiled or analyzed. We propose to address these challenges to create the most comprehensive description of the SWM to date. Our strategy includes using ultra high spatial resolution dMRI acquisitions (~700µm isotropic or better) at multiple echo times (TE), novel dMRI tractography methods designed for tracing u-fibers, anatomically informed machine learning to parcellate the u-fibers, and expert neuroanatomical generation of the SWM connectivity matrix from monkey tracer studies. Furthermore, we will develop a novel ontological framework to organize and name the SWM systems of the monkey and human brains. Overall, these steps will enable robust in-vivo tracing and capturing of inter-subject variability of the SWM of the human brain at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Our proposed deliverables will be the first comprehensive, anatomically curated atlases of the SWM in human and monkey, which will enable the study of the SWM in health and disease. We will publicly release all image data, tractography atlases, monkey connectivity matrices, extracted fascicles, and all software as open source.

"Development of neurologic itch signature Abstract: Chronic itch is a global health problem affecting tens of millions of people worldwide. However, there is no objective biomarker to assess itch. Since itch results from activity in brain circuits through the participation of many brain regions, we suggest developing specific brain biomarkers to assess the disease states and treatment effects using functional brain imaging and machine learning. Developments of biomarkers are one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. In itch treatment, assessment of itch is an important indicator in understanding the progress of chronic itch and treatment effect. Currently, itch assessment is based almost exclusively on patients' self-reports, which is inherently limited by the complex relationship between biological pruriceptive (itch-related) processes and patients' verbal or written descriptions of itch. In particular, self-report is not applicable for people who have a limited capacity to report itch such as infants, very young children, and elderly people with cognitive impairments. Addressing chronic itch is becoming a central morbidity in many dermatological diseases and a primary endpoint in clinical trials. Therefore, there is a great need to develop a reliable biomarker for itch. Itch-related neural signals are a fundamental element of the itch sensation. Measuring these signals can be a reliable biomarker for itch. Recent advancement of brain imaging combined with machine learning algorithms has enabled development of brain activity-based biomarkers to assess various mental activities and brain functions. This advancement, together with ongoing progress of low- cost & high-performance MRI, will expand the feasibility of practical use of fMRI in medicine. A brain activity- based biomarker for itch (i.e., Neurologic Itch Signature, NIS) may dramatically improve the quality of diagnoses, treatments and clinical trials. Moreover, the NIS can be a promising biomarker for itch-related processing in the brain, which enables to better understand the pathophysiology of chronic itch. The aim of our research proposal is to develop the NIS. In particular, we will demonstrate (1) that the NIS will selectively respond to itch (i.e., unresponsive to pain) and (2) that the NIS can predict not only an existence of itch but also itch intensity, as these are fundamental requirements of biomarker for itch. To achieve this goal, we will obtain datasets of brain activity during various intensities of itch and pain stimuli and resting condition by using functional MRI (fMRI), and identify a characteristic brain activity pattern for itch (i.e., the NIS) by analyzing the datasets using a machine learning algorithm. We will test whether the created NIS can predict itch and severity of itch without prior information. The NIS will accelerate itch research and improve quality of diagnosis and treatment of itch, which will eventually help the many people who suffer from chronic itch. Relevant statement Our proposal is the first project to develop a brain activity-based biomarker for itch. Success of our proposal will eventually allow us to share an objective itch assessment using the biomarker with research institutes, hospitals and industries across the world to accelerate itch research, and improve diagnosis and assessment of itch treatment.",Development of neurologic itch signature,10193704,R21AR078940,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antipruritics', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Dermatologic', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pruritus', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'chronic itch', 'cost', 'diagnosis quality', 'expectation', 'global health', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neurotransmission', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'phrases', 'primary endpoint', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment effect', 'treatment trial']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,174695
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC.",Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools,10141299,R01MH117943,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education and Outreach', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'file format', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,465332
"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,10138039,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Lymphatic System', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'detection limit', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'lymphatic vasculature', 'lymphatic vessel', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,534438
"Harmonizing and Archiving of Large-scale Infant Neuroimaging Data Project Abstract The first postnatal years are an exceptionally dynamic and critical period of structural and functional development of the human brain. Many neurodevelopmental disorders are the consequence of abnormal brain development during this stage. Several NIH-funded studies have recently acquired and released large-scale infant brain MRI datasets in the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA), leading to over 3,000 publically-available infant MRI scans from multiple imaging sites. Joint analysis of these big data of infant brains will undoubtedly improve our limited understanding of normative early brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders with boosted statistical power and reproducibility. However, the processed and harmonized data of these multi-site infant MR images still remain publically absent, due to the challenges in processing and analyzing infant MR images, which typically exhibit extremely low tissue contrast, large within-tissue intensity variations, and regionally-heterogeneous dynamic changes. To address this critical issue, the goal of this project is to comprehensively process, harmonize, discover and archive large-scale, multi-site public infant MRI datasets to significantly advance early brain development studies, by taking advantage of our infant-tailored computational tools and further developing advanced machine learning techniques. In Aim 1, we will extensively process large-scale infant MRI datasets by adopting our established and recently-improved infant- dedicated cortical surface-based computational tools and further develop a deep spherical neural network for quality control of produced cortical property maps. This will lead to quality-ensured vertex-wise maps of multiple biologically-distinct cortical properties, e.g., cortical thickness, surface area, myelin content, sulcal depth, local gyrification, curvature and diffusivity. In Aim 2, to remove site effects associated with different scanners and imaging protocols and meanwhile preserve biological associations, we will harmonize the computed cortical property maps from multi-site data in Aim 1 by leveraging our surface-to-surface cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (S2SGAN) based on the spherical U-Net, without requiring traveling subjects (paired data) across sites. To further increase the efficiency and learn more robust feature representation in the whole multi- site data, we propose to extend S2SGAN to jointly harmonize all multi-site cortical property maps using a single generator. In Aim 3, leveraging the informative growth patterns and gradient information of the harmonized maps of multiple cortical properties in Aim 2, we will discover distinct cortical regions, by capitalizing on multi-view nonnegative matrix factorization in a data-driven manner, without making any assumption on the parametric forms of growth patterns. All our processed data, results, computational tools, and source codes will be deposited into NDA, NITRC, and GitHub to significantly accelerate the pace of early brain development studies. Project Narrative This project aims to comprehensively process, harmonize, discover, and archive large-scale, multi-site public infant neuroimaging data, by taking advantage of our pioneered infant-tailored computational tools and developing advanced machine learning techniques.

"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) whole-brain imaging of non-transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole-brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo-bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide-spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state-of-the-art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,10159328,R44MH116827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2021,969855
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals. We will provide advanced brain image processing, mathematical tools, and a portal for researchers to access and add to findings.",High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain,10161678,R01AG059874,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Sex Differences', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'biobank', 'brain health', 'cognitive testing', 'data harmonization', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'demented', 'dementia risk', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome', 'flexibility', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'healthy aging', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'insight', 'male', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,619917
