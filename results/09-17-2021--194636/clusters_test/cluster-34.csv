"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults with who are at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and the reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to assess day-to-day functioning in a new way which will more effectively identify the subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence.",Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease,10190756,R01AG058687,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'functional decline', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'normal aging', 'pre-clinical', 'prodromal Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'remote monitoring', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'time use']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,527026
"Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, theoretical knowledge, and research skills to develop into a fully independent psychophysiological researcher studying biomarkers of depression that can be used as targets for novel interventions. In consultation with her mentors, the PI has recruited a team of expert consultants to guide her in executing a research project and training plan that will provide experience essential to her goals.  The proposed study will be conducted at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study focuses on late-life depression because it is prevalent and has negative outcomes. Existing treatments have low response rates and are rarely used correctly in the community due to their complexity. The project is based on the premise that focused treatments targeting biosignatures of specific neural abnormalities will have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes in late-life depression. It concentrates on positive valence systems, which are vulnerable to aging and often impaired in depression. The project will investigate positive valence systems in older adults with major depression receiving Engage, a psychotherapy designed to reactivate reward system functions. Engage has been found efficacious in late-life depression and easy to learn by community-based therapists. Consistent with RDoC methods, the proposed study will examine target engagement of Engage in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) during a 9-week course of Engage therapy, using three units of analysis to assess positive valence system function: physiology (event-related potentials), self-reports, and behavior. It will compare Engage-treated participants with 35 depressed participants, group-matched on age, receiving manualized supportive therapy. Additional analyses will assess whether low baseline positive valence function, or increases in positive valence function during treatment, predict improvement of anhedonia with Engage, and whether reward function mediates change in anhedonia.  The proposed training plan complements the research study with individualized tutorials, formal coursework, research collaborations, and manuscript preparation that will provide the PI with knowledge and skills in several areas: 1) Age-related neurobiological changes in the positive valence system and related networks; 2) Advanced statistical techniques to identify distinct neural abnormalities in depressed individuals based on their ERP profiles; and 3) Clinical trial design for psychotherapeutic interventions. The proposed project may provide important information about target engagement and mechanisms of a biologically informed, easily implemented treatment for late-life depression that has potential for dissemination. It will also provide pilot data for an R-series study using machine learning methods to predict response to Engage and will serve as an important stepping-stone for the PI as she prepares for an independent research career. Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions such as Engage – a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of the positive valence system. The proposed study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other positive valence system measures to assess target engagement in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group of 35 age-group-matched depressed peers receiving supportive therapy.",Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression,10194608,K23MH116105,"['Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuscripts', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positive Valence', 'Preparation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Stimulus', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Visual attention', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'biosignature', 'career', 'career development', 'comparison group', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning community', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'opioid user', 'peer', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'trait']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2021,190534
"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,10144995,K23DK117058,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunomodulators', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Thromboembolism', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative safety', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health management', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'privacy preservation', 'risk minimization', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K23,2021,203990
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,10186677,R01AG059729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Preparation', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'ST14 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'biracial', 'caucasian American', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'dietary', 'disability', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fitness', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'male', 'mental state', 'microbial', 'middle age', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'walking speed', 'young adult']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,638984
"Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease, which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples, which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress, which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults. We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115 black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10- year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the public health and medical burden of AD and dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This study has high potential for characterizing novel blood-based biomarkers to identify preclinical ADRD and test their utility in predicting clinical ADRD. No other study has a similar design with repeated blood mtDNA mutations, cognitive assessments, and brain imaging data during midlife, a critical time window for interventions to prevent clinical ADRD development. By also using data from four large cohorts of older adults, we can determine the clinical utility of these mtDNA biomarkers to predict clinical ADRD and move the field closer toward the NIH’s goal of personalized health interventions.",Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study,10216953,R01AG069120,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Older Population', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep sequencing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'diagnostic technologies', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'mitochondrial DNA mutation', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'whole genome', 'young adult']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,796409
"SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations   The United States population is growing older. There is an urgent need for tools to better connect health professionals with their patients and perform at-home assessments in an automated fashion. The long-term goal of this proposal is to discover the knowledge necessary to enable an always-on, non-intrusive, non-wearable smart system for automated at-home gait parameter estimation using floor vibrations. To achieve this vision, the proposal has the objective of connecting health professionals with older adults living independently through a smart system that estimates gait parameters using floor vibration. The aims to achieve this goal are to 1) determine at-home gait parameters as a function of time and space; 2) establish a digital identifier of the older adult based on gait parameters; and 3) correlate changes in at-home gait parameters, after considering spatial-temporal correlations, with changes in the well-being of the resident. The proposed research will advance the state-of-the-art in engineering, physical therapy and public health by testing the following hypotheses: 1) Floor vibration is a viable means to automatically and continuously determine gait parameters; 2) For healthy individuals living in an independent at-home setting, gait parameters will be consistent based on location in the home, time of the day and day of the week; and 3) For patients recently discharged from the hospital, recovery will correlate with improvements in their gait parameters. The testing of the hypotheses will be performed through five tasks: 1) Develop an automated system to capture floor vibration and extract gait parameters; 2) Validate the system in laboratory setting; 3) Collect data at participant’s homes; 4) Test the hypothesis that at-home gait parameters are consistent with time and space; 5) Test the hypothesis that improvement in gait parameters correlates improvement in health status of recently discharged patients. This research will be pursued by a group of interdisciplinary researchers in engineering and physical therapy with the support of an experienced geriatric physician and will advance the knowledge in signal processing techniques, estimation and validation of at-home gait parameters and their uncertainty, and relationship between changes at-home gait parameters and changes in health status. The proposed activities will have a significant impact on older adult care, the research community and the next generation of researchers and engineers stemming from: 1) improved health of older adults and reduced health care cost by early intervening and thus decreasing the readmission rate; 2) increased scientific literacy and public engagement through benchmark problems, interdisciplinary seminars, new courses and outreach activities; 3) the training of diverse convergence researchers competent in solving interdisciplinary problems, including underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The proposed research aligns with the mission of National Institute of Aging by developing automated, non-intrusive, privacy-preserving at-home gait assessment tools based on floor vibrations to correlate changes of gait parameters with the health status of older adults. The outcomes of this project will enable health professionals to monitor the well-being of the older population and manage recovery paradigms thereby improving the health and well-being of older Americans.",SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations  ,10188392,R01AG067395,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Floor', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical therapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'STEM field', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'privacy preservation', 'readmission rates', 'scientific literacy', 'signal processing', 'spatial relationship', 'stem', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,294904
"Advanced Development and Utilization of Assembled Aging Trajectory Files from Multiple Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY This goal of this project is to create a unique and comprehensive research repository of aging trajectory da- tasets, related resources, and analytic methods that can be used to answer new and important questions in aging and related sciences. Specifically, by harmonizing and merging multiple data sets this project will gener- ate the data infrastructure needed to understand change over time in care settings, geriatric syndromes, physi- cal functioning, and shared risk factors at multiple levels (patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and society) and across multiple domains (biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and physical/built environments) including chronic conditions and history of acute illness such as COVID-19, exposure to air pollution, neighbor- hood socioeconomic, and health care system factors (Aim 1). Analytic strategies will be developed for user- defined cohorts and their propensity score-matched controls, e.g., older adults who were living with chronic conditions including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), diabetes, heart failure, end-stage re- nal disease, metastatic cancer, and HIV. State-of-the-art analytic methods are used to identify patterns of ag- ing trajectories (care setting, geriatric syndromes, physical functioning) experienced by older adults during the final years of life and their association with shared risk factors and distal outcomes (Aim 2). From the assem- bled trajectory file in Aim 1, cohorts are derived by aligning an originating index time such as age cutoff point and time at diagnosis (e.g., ADRD, stroke, chronic kidney disease). Both a model-based approach and ma- chine learning algorithms are then used to discover multilevel and potentially interactive predictors of trajecto- ries (e.g., rapid functional decline in independent living beneficiaries) and specific outcomes (e.g., respiratory ventilator usage among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with COVID-19) (Aim 3). The unique resources are then shared to disseminate resources including datasets, documentation, source code, and methodology (Aim 4). At the end of this project, the research infrastructure to investigate the relationship between shared risk factors and aging trajectories will be ready to use and replicate, giving investigators unprecedented ability to solve new challenges in aging science. This will allow researchers to understand the underlying processes and systems associated with reversible periods of disability across care settings, and interventions that may be used to support recovery of function and reduction of geriatric syndromes including cognitive decline, for the purpose of reducing burdensome care transitions, and maintenance of functional independence. This project will also create the resources and methods needed to evaluate the impact of innovations and interventions im- plemented at the patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and society/policy levels to improve care quality and outcomes for older adults.

"Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 70% of older adults and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor- tality in the United States. Several new drugs have recently been approved for CVD, but not enough is known about their utilization, benefits and risks in frail older patients. Since conducting a clinical trial in frail older adults can be costly and impractical, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to generate evidence on new CVD drugs in a timely manner. The objective of this application is to establish a near-real-time prospective monitoring program in Medicare data to evaluate the benefit of new CVD drugs for older adults with frailty. A prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. The investigators will incorporate a novel claims-based frailty index into the monitoring program to generate timely evidence on disease-specific and patient-centered net benefit of new drugs by frailty status. The central hypothesis is that disease-specific benefit and net benefit are determined by a patient's degree of frailty. Disease-specific benefit will be evaluated using clinical trial endpoints of effectiveness (e.g., CVD events) and safety (e.g., bleeding), and net benefit in terms of the number of days alive and spent at home, or “home time”. To conduct this work, the investigators will analyze Medicare data on 6 new CVD drugs approved in 2011-2017: 3 anticoagulants vs warfarin for atrial fibrillation, 2 antiplatelets vs clopidogrel for atherosclerotic CVD, and an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor vs enalapril for systolic heart failure. The validity and reproducibility of the results will be enhanced through the linkage of a subset of Medicare data to electronic health records and a national survey to supplement clinical information, and external validation of the Medicare data analysis in 2 large commercial databases. In the next 4 years, the investigators will accomplish 3 specific aims: 1) evaluate the temporal trends and predictors of new CVD drug use in frail and non-frail older adults with CVD over 2011-2020; 2) determine disease-specific benefit (deaths, CVD and safety events) and net benefit (home time) of 6 new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies; 3) identify patient characteristics that can predict net benefit (home time) with new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies. This proposal's innovative approach, which combines near-real-time prospective monitor- ing, a claims-based frailty score, and the patient-centered outcome of home time, offers a readily scalable and feasible framework for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of newly approved medications. The impact of the proposed research is significant because timely evidence generated from real-world healthcare data can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new CVD drugs based on a patient's frailty and expected net benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to establish a prospective monitoring program for newly approved cardiovascular drugs for older adults with frailty in routine healthcare databases and identify predictors of benefit from the new drugs. This research is relevant to public health because the evidence generated from this work can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new cardiovascular drugs in older adults based on a patient's frailty level and expected net benefit. Thus, it accomplishes the National Institute on Aging's missions and initiatives by promoting effective and safe drug therapy in older adults.",Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty,10102161,R01AG062713,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enalapril', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frail Elderly', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neprilysin', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical trial analysis', 'clopidogrel', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'cost', 'frailty', 'head-to-head comparison', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'safety study', 'sex']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,723192
"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged ≥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Association’s consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that “There are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.” Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents. This study will examine the use and safety of antidiabetic treatments across subgroups (phenotypes) of older nursing home residents with diabetes.",Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents,10137311,R21NR019160,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age Distribution', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Coin', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care Nursing', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medication Management', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'diabetes management', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'human old age (65+)', 'instrument', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized medicine', 'trend', 'virtual']",NINR,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2021,209375
"Mechanisms, response heterogeneity and dosing from MRI-derived electric field models in tDCS augmented cognitive training: a secondary data analysis of the ACT study ABSTRACT There is a pressing need for effective interventions to remediate age-related cognitive decline and alter the trajectory toward Alzheimer’s disease. The NIA Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative funded Phase III Augmenting Cognitive Training in Older Adults (ACT) trial aimed to demonstrate that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with cognitive training could achieve this goal. The present study proposes a state of the art secondary data analysis of ACT trial data that will further this aim by 1) elucidate mechanism of action underlying response to tDCS treatment with CT, 2) address heterogeneity of response in tDCS augmented CT by determining how individual variation in the dose of electrical current delivered to the brain interacts with individual brain anatomical characteristics; and 3) refine the intervention strategy of tDCS paired with CT by evaluating methods for precision delivery targeted dosing characteristics to facilitate tDCS augmented outcomes. tDCS intervention to date, including ACT, apply a fixed dosing approach whereby a single stimulation intensity (e.g., 2mA) and set of electrode positions on the scalp (e.g., F3/F4) is applied to all participants/patients. However, our recent work has demonstrated that age-related changes in neuroanatomy as well as individual variability in head/brain structures (e.g., skull thickness) significantly impacts the distribution and intensity of electrical current induced in the brain from tDCS. This project will use person-specific MRI-derived finite element computational models of electric current characteristics (current intensity and direction of current flow) and new methods for enhancing the precision and accuracy of derived models to precisely quantify the heterogeneity of current delivery in older adults. We will leverage these individualized precision models with state-of-the-art support vector machine learning methods to determine the relationship between current characteristics and treatment response to tDCS and CT. We will leverage the inherent heterogeneity of neuroanatomy and fixed current delivery to provide insight in the not only which dosing parameters were associated with treatment response, but also brain region specific information to facilitate targeted delivery of stimulation in future trials. Further still, the current study will also pioneer new methods for calculation of precision dosing parameters for tDCS delivery to potentially optimize treatment response, as well as identify clinical and demographic characteristics that are associated with response to tDCS and CT in older adults. Leveraging a robust and comprehensive behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging data set for ACT with advanced computational methods, the proposed study will provide critical information for mechanism, heterogeneity of treatment response and a pathway to refined precision dosing approaches for remediating age- related cognitive decline and altering the trajectory of older adults toward Alzheimer’s disease. NARRATIVE This secondary data analysis leverages data from an Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative funded Phase III randomized clinical trial examining benefits of transcranial direct current stimulation paired with cognitive training to remediate age-related cognitive decline and alter trajectories toward Alzheimer’s disease. Using advanced neuroimaging-derived computational modeling and artificial intelligence-based machine learning methods, the study will determine the mechanisms underlying response vs. non-response to treatment in older adults and precision dosing parameters for optimizing treatment outcomes.","Mechanisms, response heterogeneity and dosing from MRI-derived electric field models in tDCS augmented cognitive training: a secondary data analysis of the ACT study",10170947,RF1AG071469,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CCL4 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dose', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Thick', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'age related', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive training', 'comorbidity', 'cranium', 'effective intervention', 'electric field', 'experience', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'sex', 'support vector machine', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,RF1,2021,2180958
"Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This is a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award submitted to the National Institute on Aging by Yongkang Zhang, a Research Associate in the Department of Healthcare Policy and Research at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC). Dr. Zhang’s career goal is to become an independent researcher on improving care for the elderly through developing and applying effective prediction tools to identify older adults with complex conditions and high healthcare needs. This K99/R00 application will provide Dr. Zhang with the necessary training 1) to understand the complexity and characteristics of high-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults; 2) to develop a prediction model for HNHC adults using machine learning methods; and 3) to test the performance of the machine learning-based model with three commonly used, patient-risk prediction tools.  Dr. Zhang has assembled a mentor team of accomplished researchers across multiple divisions and departments at Weill Cornell Medical College: Dr. Rainu Kaushal (primary mentor) who is the Nanette Laitman Distinguished Professor and an expert on the HNHC patients and health data science; Dr. Lawrence Casalino (co-mentor) who is the Livingston Farrand Professor of Public Health and an expert on characteristics of and healthcare delivery for HNHC patients; Dr. Mark Lachs (co-mentor) who is a Professor of Geriatrics and prac- ticing geriatrician and an expert on the complexity and healthcare needs of older adults; Dr. Yuhua Bao (co- mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Healthcare Policy and Research and expert on behavioral health conditions and prescription data; Dr. Fei Wang (co-mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Health Informat- ics and an expert on machine learning methods; and Dr. James Flory (consultant) who is an Assistant Profes- sor of Healthcare Policy and Research and practicing clinician and an expert on medication use.  HNHC older adults are small group of patients representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utili- zation. These patients are more likely to experience preventable quality and safety problems due to their fre- quent interactions with health systems. Caring for HNHC older adults provides great potential benefits for qual- ity improvement and cost reduction. However, the benefits are unlikely to be realized unless these patients can be correctly identified and targeted. Building on his previous research and training on developing a claims data-based taxonomy for HNHC Medicare patients, Dr. Zhang’s research will understand the characteristics of HNHC older adults and develop predictors for these patients using clinical and prescription data (Aim 1), de- velop a machine learning-based prediction model for HNHC older adults (Aim 2), and compare the perfor- mance of the prediction model with three commonly used, patient risk prediction tools (Aim 3). This research will be the foundation for an R01 grant application that will incorporate this prediction model into healthcare de- livery process and identify the optimal ways to inform opportunities for improvement in healthcare delivery. PROJECT NARRATIVE High-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults are a small group of individuals representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utilization and experiencing preventable quality and safety problems. Improving care for HNHC older adults is challenging because of their complex medical, behavioral, and social conditions and the instability of their healthcare utilization. Developing a prediction model for HNHC older adults could better inform patient-centered clinical decision-making, help target quality improvement interventions, and prioritize the allocation of scarce healthcare resources.","Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults",10150732,K99AG064030,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policy Research', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Conditions', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'career', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'distinguished professor', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service organization', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'multilayer perceptron', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'performance tests', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'random forest', 'risk prediction', 'social', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2021,125185
"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC.

"Harmonizing and Integrating Nursing Data into Multidisciplinary Datasets to Evaluate Hospital Care and Readmissions of Older Adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias Project Summary/Abstract Currently, in the United States, there are 5.8 million older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). Twenty-one percent of older adults with AD/ADRD have unplanned, and often preventable, hospital readmissions within 30-days, which are estimated to cost over $5.4 billion per year. The development of clinical data research networks (CDRN) and their large complex datasets including patient and clinical level data have led to the development of various models to predict readmissions. However, the existing models have not demonstrated adequate predictive capability. The opportunity to integrate nursing care plan (i.e., patient problems, goals, and interventions) to these large datasets can fill gaps and improve the accuracy of prediction models. The development of a research data infrastructure that supports the integration of nursing care plan data to CDRN datasets is therefore critical for understanding and improving interdisciplinary care aimed at reducing readmissions of older adults with AD/ADRD. In this project, we propose to expand the research infrastructure of the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium and Data Trust through the creation, for the first time, of a reusable and feasible data pipeline that will ultimately integrate key care plan data elements documented by nurses into the OneFlorida Data Trust. The long-term goal of our research program is to gain a deeper understanding of readmissions for the aging population with AD/ADRD through the availability of an expanded dataset with interdisciplinary data. We plan to carry out the following aims: Specific Aim 1 (R21 Phase): Develop and test a prototype pipeline for extracting, translating, and integrating problems and goals in nursing care plan data from the University of Florida (UF Health) into the statewide OneFlorida Data Trust. We will map the local vocabulary used to represent the two nursing data elements to nationally recognized terminology sets using natural language processing and have registered nurses validate the mapping results. We will then use automated scripts to replace the local vocabulary with the standardized terms and integrate the data into the Trust. Specific Aim 2 (R33 Phase): Convert and integrate into the Trust nursing interventions from UF Health. Specific Aim 3 (R33 Phase): Extract, convert, and integrate to the Trust nursing data from a second organization, using the pipeline from the R21 phase. Specific Aim 4 (R33 Phase): Construct and test readmissions prediction models for older adults (aged 65 and above) with AD/ADRD using pertinent variables from the Trust and environmental dataset linked to it. We will develop machine-learning models for predicting readmissions from the nursing care elements, other patient- level data in the Trust, and important environmental variables that influence post-discharge follow-up care. Our team will be among the first to develop sustainable data pipelines for transforming local nursing care plan data into standardized data for integration into a large dataset. Through this study, we will learn the improvements nurses, physicians, and other providers can make to prevent readmissions. Project Narrative We will expand a research infrastructure to support the integration of nursing care plan data to large complex datasets with patient and clinical level data. Through this expanded research infrastructure, we will be able to create predictive models with nursing, clinical, and environmental data for unplanned readmissions of older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias. We are confident that this study will be a model for the development of new research-data infrastructure and will allow us to learn the improvements nurses, physicians, and other providers can make to prevent readmissions.",Harmonizing and Integrating Nursing Data into Multidisciplinary Datasets to Evaluate Hospital Care and Readmissions of Older Adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias,10204503,R21AG072265,"['Ache', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical Care Team', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Care Plans', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Registered nurse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States', 'Universities', 'University resources', 'Vocabulary', 'age group', 'aged', 'aging population', 'application programming interface', 'care providers', 'clinical development', 'cost', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data pipeline', 'data standards', 'follow-up', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'model development', 'multidisciplinary', 'nursing intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'readmission rates']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2021,190625
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Black scientists are underrepresented in health-related research fields and women from racial and ethnic minority groups face particular challenges at the graduate level and beyond. The goal of this supplement, consistent with the priorities of NIH, is to address this gap and promote diversity in behavioral and biomedical health research by providing support for Ibukun E. Fowe, a Public Health PhD student in the department of Health Systems and Policy at the OHSU-PSU School of Public Health and member of an underrepresented group in health-related sciences, to gain experience conducting research in the area of understanding older adults’ adherence to technology-based interventions to measure and support health behaviors, including behaviors that predict or prevent cognitive impairment. This support is aimed to aid Fowe transition from graduate student to post-doctoral researcher and gain background and research experience to help ensure her success as an independent investigator. She will gain experience supervising and participating in the implementation of complex randomized controlled trials, an understanding of the potential of machine learning techniques to detect and prevent cognitive impairment, and additional training through supplemental activities developing and conducting studies that will explore barriers to the collection and use of older adults’ digital phenotypic and biomarker information through wearable devices and smartphone applications. This will serve the parent grant by expanding the impact of each specific aim (SA); SA1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols - digital phenotypic and biomarker information provide useful state and trait information about individuals which can enhance predictions of adherence failures, SA2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence –the study of barriers to long- term adherence will be extended to technologies beyond tablet and smartphone assessments and interventions through supplemental activities involving wearables, and SA3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures –Fowe, working with the data and computer scientists of the APPT team, will investigate how digital phenotypic and biomarker information might provide additional context to enhance predictions of adherence lapses and improve the timing of reminders to maximize successful intervention reengagement. We have developed a tailored plan for Ibukun Fowe’s research and career development. This plan includes 1) supervised mentoring and mentorship sessions; 2) active involvement in the research design and analysis process; 3) active involvement in the dissemination of study findings; 4) interactions with other researchers and scientists, and 5) networking through the process of participation in scientific activities such as professional meetings, conferences, and research meetings. This supplement is designed to provide Ibukun Fowe, a dedicated and promising junior investigator and member of an underrepresented group in health-related sciences, with the experience and mentorship necessary to conduct aging research with a specific focus on cognitive health and decline, and to gain understanding of the potential of artificial intelligence and other machine learning approaches to advance successful aging. The diverse expertise within the APPT team of the parent grant is well-suited to provide relevant mentorship and training to help Fowe transition to a successful independent investigator.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,10306973,R01AG064529,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Minority Groups', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Professional Meetings and Conferences', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Supervision', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'career development', 'design', 'digital', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'meetings', 'member', 'parent grant', 'person centered', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'racial minority', 'research and development', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'trait', 'wearable device']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,84896
"Development and Validation of a Prediction Model for Longitudinal Fall Risk in Older Adults ABSTRACT My goal is to establish myself as an independent biostatistical researcher who develops and validates prediction models that are critical to identifying older adults at high risk of adverse health outcomes using novel machine learning methodology. My passion for developing prediction models for health outcomes in older adults stems from my desire to help people, especially older adults who are vulnerable. I developed a machine learning method called Binary Mixed Model (BiMM) forest, which is particularly suited for developing prediction models for repeated measures of outcomes in older adults because it accommodates dynamic fluctuations over time which are common in aging (e.g., functional status). Environment: Wake Forest School of Medicine is a nationally-recognized leader in geriatric research and provides an outstanding environment for accomplishing my goals. Mentors: I have an excellent interdisciplinary mentoring team consisting of experts in aging, biostatistics and informatics who are dedicated to supporting me in completing the research and training aims proposed in this K25 grant. Training: I will complete activities aimed to address gaps in my training with the guidance of my mentoring team. My Training Objectives are to 1) acquire knowledge about gerontology and geriatrics, 2) deepen my understanding of missing data mechanisms and techniques, 3) learn about the appropriate use of electronic health record (EHR) data for research purposes, and 4) develop leadership, networking, communication and grant writing skills. To accomplish these objectives, I will attend conferences, seminars, journal club, case conferences and writing workshops, observe a geriatric clinician, and complete coursework. The K25 grant will allow me to extend previous training, which will provide me superior knowledge, experience and skills for my future as a biostatistical researcher in aging. Research: Early identification of older adults at-risk of falling is critical so that preventative care plans may be implemented to improve patient outcomes and reduce burden on the health care system. Most current prediction models cannot handle repeated measurements over time and have not been used with EHR data. I propose to use my BiMM forest method to develop a prediction model for fall risk over time. My Research Specific Aims are to 1) impute (fill in) missing predictor data in Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study with a novel machine learning method (BiMM forest); 2) develop a prediction model for identifying older adults at-risk for falls; and 3) assess the feasibility of using EHR data to externally validate the prediction model. The prediction model developed in this proposal will aid in identification of at-risk individuals for falls, allowing providers to intervene early to reduce the burden of falls for patients, caregivers and healthcare systems. Results from this grant will provide a basis for future R01 submissions to further validate the prediction model using EHR data from multiple health care centers and evaluate the clinical utility of the model in practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying older adults at-risk for falls is critical for implementing preventative interventions aimed at reducing adverse outcomes, but developing prediction models for fall-risk remains challenging due to analytic shortcomings, missing data, and limitations of electronic health record (EHR) data. This K25 Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award provides Dr. Jaime Lynn Speiser with essential training in aging, missing data methodology, EHR data analysis, and career development to facilitate her transition into an independent biostatistical researcher in aging. The prediction model developed in this K25 research proposal and validated with EHR data will aid in identification of at-risk individuals for falls through an automated mechanism.",Development and Validation of a Prediction Model for Longitudinal Fall Risk in Older Adults,10215772,K25AG068253,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Body Composition', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'functional decline', 'functional status', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'research study', 'severe injury', 'skills', 'stem', 'symposium']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K25,2021,122627
"Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE) ABSTRACT Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries in older adults (ages 65+). Injuries due to falling result in 2.8 million emergency visits annually, and 25% of falls result in very serious injuries (such as fractures or traumatic brain injury). Through this diversity supplement, Dr. Monroe Kennedy, an engineer interested in aging research, seeks to get training and mentoring in geroscience. As part of this diversity supplement, Dr. Kennedy, proposes to develop a wearable smartbelt device that can alert the wearer to risk of falling and potentially prevent falls. Combined with a robust training plan, the proposed activities will prepare Dr. Kennedy to become a leader in geriatrics research and make impactful contributions to the field of aging research.  Aim 1 will be to conduct focus groups with older adults on the wearable smartbelt device, such as style and comfort. Aim 2 will test the wearable smartbelt device by collecting visual and sensor data from older adults while walking on various surfaces at slow and brisk paces. The data will be used to train the falls prevention model utilizing machine learning methods. The ultimate goal is for the model to be able to calculate fall risk by predicting potential walking trajectories of the wearer and imbalance and alert the wearer via vibrotactile response if the risk of falling is probable. By preventing falls from occurring in the first place, the proposed device has the potential to greatly increase the overall well-being, long-term health, and independence of older adults as well as costs associated with hospital visits and caregiving. PROJECT NARRATIVE Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries for older adults. The goal of this project is to develop a wearable smartbelt device that can predict whether the wearer is at risk of falling so that the wearer can stop and ensure they are balanced before continuing to walk. This technology has the potential to prevent older adults from falling in the first place, thereby improving their overall long-term health, quality of life, and independence.",Stanford Aging & Ethnogeriatrics Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (SAGE),10319307,P30AG059307,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fall prevention', 'Focus Groups', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'caregiving', 'cost', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,35326
"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,10210345,R01AG057764,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Deception', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Foundations', 'Fraud', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Structure', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Transact', 'Validation', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cyber security', 'decision-making capacity', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'financial decision making', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phishing', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social factors', 'statistical and machine learning', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,322014
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,10119275,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,470083
"Multimorbidity and Treatment-Related Outcomes in Older Heart Failure Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for hospitalization in older adults. Over 85% of all patients hospitalized with HF are 65 years of age or older. Multimorbidity, typically defined as the presence of ≥2 chronic conditions, increases the risks of hospitalization and death in older HF patients, and greatly complicates the clinical management of HF. Caution is required in applying national clinical practice guidelines to the care of older adults with multimorbidity, as this could result in undesirable net effects and less than optimal outcomes including adverse interactions between drugs and various concomitant diseases. In response to PA-17-088 (Exploratory Analyses of Existing Cohorts, Data Sets, and Stored Biospecimens to Address Clinical Aging Research Questions, R01), we propose to leverage an existing HF cohort, including data for more than 100,000 patients with HF within the Cardiovascular Research Network between 2005-2012, with follow-up data up to 2017. We will extend our previous efforts by examining treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in older adults with HF and a wide spectrum of multimorbidity burden. We will further examine the benefits and adverse outcomes of various therapies focusing on particularly vulnerable subgroups of patients with HF afflicted by two prevalent conditions, anemia or diabetes. Our specific aims are: (1) to examine the effectiveness of selected medical therapies (renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and aldosterone receptor blockers) on death, HF hospitalization, and all-cause hospitalizations in a large, community-based population of older adults with HF across a range of levels of multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction; (2) to evaluate targeted adverse outcomes, including kidney dysfunction, hyperkalemia, sodium disturbances, bradycardia, and syncope associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF, stratified by multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction status; and (3) to characterize the potential benefits and adverse outcomes associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF and two prevalent comorbidity dyads—HF- diabetes and HF-anemia—that are common and substantially increase the risks of death and morbidity. In addition, we will create novel, validated methods to identify adverse outcomes related to HF therapies from unstructured data in large electronic health record systems through natural language processing technology, along with employing state-of-the-art analytic approaches to evaluate treatment-related outcomes. In that our proposed investigation will take advantage of a large, geographically and demographically diverse cohort of adults with HF receiving care within community-based healthcare delivery systems, we anticipate our findings will be highly generalizable to the broad spectrum of older adults with HF managed in “real-world” practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The presence of multiple chronic conditions, or multimorbidity, in older adults with heart failure substantially increases the complexity of their care, and increases the risks of hospitalization and death. In our study, we will examine treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in patients with heart failure and multimorbidity.
