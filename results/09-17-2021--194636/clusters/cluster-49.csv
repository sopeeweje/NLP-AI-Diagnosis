"A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring Glaucoma is a complex neurodegenerative disease that results in degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. With older people making up the fastest growing part of the US population, glaucoma will become even more prevalent in the US in the coming decades. Due to the complex interaction of multiple factors in glaucoma, better structural and functional predictors are needed for its progression. The main impediments are massive health record data and sophisticated computational models. Our overall goal is to leverage the power of big data and rapidly evolving machine learning approaches. The NEI's “Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)” initiative and the American Academy of Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry are all efforts to exploit the power of data and to better understand diseases and to provide improved prevention and treatment.  In this multi-PI proposal, we offer to assemble over 1 million optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual fields (VFs) from the glaucoma research network (GRN). We propose to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that synthesizes Gaussian mixture model expectation maximization (GEM) and archetypal machine learning approach to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring using VFs and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements. We will make these tools openly available to the vision and ophthalmology research communities.  Our proposed studies could offer substantial improvements in the prognosis of glaucoma as well as potentially providing OCT and joint VF/OCT surrogate endpoints to be used in glaucoma clinical trials. Leveraging big data in eye care is challenging. This study uses big functional and structural glaucoma data and develops hybrid machine learning models to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring. Results could offer substantial improvements in prognosis of glaucoma and may provide surrogate endpoints for use in glaucoma clinical trials.",A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring,9723609,R21EY030142,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Gaussian model', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'analytical method', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data space', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'field study', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'retinal ganglion cell degeneration', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2019,278421,0.056430069445448025
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,9767751,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Facebook', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2019,204981,0.060844257098268933
"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,9753295,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,279949,0.04070155805429426
"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

"Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population. PROJECT SUMMARY I propose to gain experience in what are becoming the next big topics in genomic medicine – the integration of “big data” using data science in order to achieve “precision health” – what could be summed up as “data science of the future”. These topics emerge from - but go beyond - the narrower concept of “precision medicine” as the use of genetic information for treatment decisions. The goal is to develop experience in data science and precision health so that my work can serve as a bridge between my field of economics and these fields - and begin to prepare for the future challenges as they emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both data science and precision health will be critical components of future health care interventions and impact patients, providers, and society. “Big Data” using data science includes the aggregation and analysis of data across platforms (includes information from, e.g. genetic testing, biosensors, wearables, and electronic health records, with such data analyzed using, e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning). Precision Health uses a “big data” approach to focus on disease prevention and detection throughout one’s lifetime.","Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population.",9929780,U01HG009599,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biosensor', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Patients', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Sum', 'Work', 'data integration', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'formal learning', 'genetic information', 'informal learning', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2019,166973,0.0765110493306957
"Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design Project Summary/Abstract The next generation of bioengineering and biomedical researchers will have unprecedented access to technologies including wireless health, big data, genetic sequencing, and machine learning approaches to enable modern diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. This presents individuals trained at the interface of technology and biomedicine with an enormous opportunity to address the world’s needs in health and medicine. In the Bioengineering Department at the University of California, Los Angeles, we aim to develop students into leaders able to seamlessly identify clinical needs that technology can address, design and validate solutions that address these needs, communicate with a variety of stakeholders to build teams invested in problem-oriented solutions, and to navigate the regulatory and commercial pathways necessary to enable their technologies to thrive. The Bioengineering Capstone Series at UCLA leverages resources available at UCLA to enable students to: 1) gain insight into clinical needs directly from clinicians and educators across the Ronald Reagan Medical Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, School of Dentistry and UCLA Health System, 2) design their solutions through mentorship from engineering professors, 3) understand the complexities of the biomedical industry with support from the UCLA Technology Development Group and members of the Department of Engineering Industry Advisory Board, 4) utilize modern technologies in wireless health and data science by collaborating with the Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data- to-Knowledge (MD2K) and Mobile Health (mHealth) Institute at UCLA, and 5) work with the National Science Foundation Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations Engineering Research Center (NSF PATHS- UP ERC) to learn to target and communicate their technologies to maximize societal benefits. Statement of Public Health Relevance: To prepare the next generation of engineers with skills in the design of therapeutics and medical devices, this research education program will provide bioengineering students at UCLA with enhanced opportunities to engage in real world design for biomedical applications. We will guide students through the medical design process from identifying needs, creating solutions which address these needs, and communicating the significance of their contributions to the greater community, ultimately yielding a larger pool of well-trained engineers to address biomedical challenges. !",Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design,9709138,R25EB027626,"['Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Technology', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High School Student', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intellectual Property', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modernization', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'STEM field', 'School Dentistry', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education research', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'lectures', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'product development', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'skills', 'technology development', 'undergraduate student']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R25,2019,21600,0.044155465824172804
"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems.

"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio)statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field of health big data. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offers and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will primarily draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from three different departments within three different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science, Medicine, Population Health, Social and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including statistical modeling, data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high- dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and medical imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and success with the current summer program on Big Data led by this team with 164 students trained in the last 4 years (2015-2018) including 90 female students and 30 students from underrepresented minority groups. Fourteen of these participants from the last three years are currently graduate students in Michigan Biostatistics. The ongoing program has gained traction in the national landscape of summer research programs with 20% rate of admission and 80% rate of acceptance among those who are offered this opportunity. The program has consistently received very strong evaluation and our past alumni have become brand ambassadors and advocates for our program. We plan to build on the success and legacy of this program in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2019-2021). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a non-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 45 undergraduates nationally and internationally, with 20 domestic students supported by the requested SIBS funding mechanism and others supported by supplementary institutional and foundation support. We propose to expose the trainees to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of health Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. They will engage in mentored research projects in three primary areas of health big data: Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. Some of the projects will be defined in the area of cardiovascular precision medicine, defined by a team of highly quantitative researchers engaged in cardiovascular research that uses big data. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by U-M researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. We propose an inter-SIBS collaboration with Dordt College summer program trainees who will attend this concluding symposium. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world. We will offer multiple professional development opportunities and resources for graduate school preparation to our trainees so that they can reflect and plan beyond their senior year. All of our proposed activities are reflected through our three specific aims: Teaching, Mentoring and Dissemination. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a six week long undergraduate summer institute: “Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data” to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 45 undergraduate students recruited nationally and internationally, from 2019-2021. Funding is requested for 20 domestic students with supplementary funding expected to be garnered through institutional resources and private foundation support. The program builds on the success of our existing Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI) supported by a NIH BD2K Courses and Skills grant award that is ending in 2018. We plan to expose program students to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data and Human Health. We enhance our ongoing summer program structure in the current proposal by involving a team of researchers working at the intersection of cardiovascular research and data science with a focus on cardiovascular precision medicine where some of the new mentored research projects will be defined. We primarily focus on three genres of health Big Data arising in Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. The trainees will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty from Biostatistics, Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences, Epidemiology and Medicine, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation.

"Big Omics Data Engine 2 Supercomputer Computational and data science has transformed biomedical scientific discovery: its approaches are embedded into a wide range of workflows for diseases such as schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, influenza, autism, drug addiction, pediatric cardiac care, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, prostate cancer and multiple myleloma. Sixty-one basic and translational researchers at Mount Sinai representing over $100 million in NIH funding, along with their collaborators from 75 external institutions, have utilized the Big Omics Data Engine (BODE) supercomputer to elucidate significant scientific findings in over 167 publications, including high impact journals such as Nature and Science, with 2,427 citations in three years. These researchers have also shared the data generated on BODE throughout their consortia and into national data sharing repositories. BODE is nearing the end of its vendor maintainable life, and researchers need increased computational throughput and storage space. To empower researchers to not only continue their inquiries, but to also tackle more complex scientific questions with decreased time to solution, we propose the Big Omics Data Engine 2 Supercomputer (BODE2). BODE2 will contain a total of 3,200 Intel Cascade Lake cores with 15 terabytes of memory and 14 petabytes of raw storage, and will leverage an existing 250 terabytes of SSDs. An instrument of this size is not available elsewhere affordably. With the proposed instrument, researchers will be able to take advantage of three major benefits: (1) the ability to receive results faster for overall greater scientific throughput; (2) the ability to increase the fidelity of their simulations and analyses; and (3) the ability to migrate research applications seamlessly to the software environment for greater scientific productivity. As with data produced on BODE, BODE2 data products will also be shared with the broader scientific community. BODE2 will provide the critical infrastructure needed by the wide range of researchers and clinicians for the genetics and population analysis, gene expression, machine learning and structural and chemical biology approaches used to make advances in these diseases. A specialized Big Omics Data Engine 2 Supercomputer instrument will provide necessary computational and data science infrastructure for 61 research projects with 75 collaborating institutions in diverse areas such as Alzheimer's, autism, schizophrenia, drug addiction, influenza, pediatric cardiac care, depression, epilepsy, prostate cancer and multiple myeloma.

"Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud PROJECT SUMMARY Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of big data. Public cloud vendors provide computing as-a-utility enabling users to pay only for the resources that are actually used. In this application, we will develop methods and tools to enable biomedical researchers to optimize the costs of cloud computing when analyzing biomedical big data. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud provides computing as a utility, on-demand, to end users, enabling cloud resources to be rapidly provisioned and scaled to meet computational and performance requirements. In addition, dynamic intelligent allocation of cloud computing resources has great potential to both improve performance and reduce hosting costs. Unfortunately, determining the most cost-effective and efficient ways to deploy modules on the cloud is non- trivial, due to a plethora of cloud vendors, each providing different types of virtual machines with different capabilities, performance trade-offs, and pricing structures. In addition, modern bioinformatics workflows consist of multiple modules, applications and libraries, each with their own set of software dependencies. Software containers package binary executables and scripts into modules with their software dependencies. With containers that compartmentalize software dependencies, modules implemented as containers can be mixed and matched to create workflows that give identical results on any platform. The high degree of reproducibility and flexibility of software containers makes them ideal instruments for disseminating complex bioinformatics workflows.

"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,9650637,R25MH112480,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Habits', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'design', 'e-science', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'lectures', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'project-based learning', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer institute', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2019,199118,0.028894750108159707
"QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a combination of innovative statistical and data visualization approaches using patient-generated health data, including mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable devices and smartphones, and patient-reported outcomes, to improve outcomes for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). This research will offer new insights into how to process and transform patient-generated health data into precise lifestyle recommendations to help achieve remission of symptoms. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To develop new preprocessing methods for publicly available, heterogeneous, time-varied mHealth data to develop a high quality mHealth dataset; 2) To develop and apply novel machine learning methods to obtain accurate predictions and formal statistical inference for the influence of lifestyle features on disease activity in IBDs; and 3) To design and develop innovative, interactive data visualization tools for knowledge discovery. The methods developed in the areas of preprocessing of mHealth data, calibration for mHealth devices, machine learning, and interactive data visualization will be broadly applicable to other mHealth data, chronic conditions beyond IBDs, and other fields in which the data streams are highly variable, intermittent, and periodic. This work is highly relevant to the mission of the NIH BD2K initiative which supports the development of innovative and transformative approaches and tools to accelerate the integration of Big Data and data science into biomedical research. This project will also enhance training in the development and use of methods for biomedical Big Data science and mentor the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists.

"Statistical Methods for Ultrahigh-dimensional Biomedical Data This proposal develops novel statistics and machine learning methods for distributed analysis of big data in biomedical studies and precision medicine and for selecting a small group of molecules that are associated with biological and clinical outcomes from high-throughput data such as microarray, proteomic, and next generation sequence from biomedical research, especially for autism studies and Alzheimer’s disease research. It focuses on developing efficient distributed statistical methods for Big Data computing, storage, and communication, and for solving distributed health data collected at different locations that are hard to aggregate in meta-analysis due to privacy and ownership concerns. It develops both computationally and statistically efficient methods and valid statistical tools for exploring heterogeneity of big data in precision medicine, for studying associations of genomics and genetic information with clinical and biological outcomes, and for feature selection and model building in presence of errors-in- variables, endogeneity, and heavy-tail error distributions, and for predicting clinical outcomes and understanding molecular mechanisms. It introduces more robust and powerful statistical tests for selection of significant genes, SNPs, and proteins in presence of dependence of data, valid control of false discovery rate for dependent test statistics, and evaluation of treatment effects on a group of molecules. The strength and weakness of each proposed method will be critically analyzed via theoretical investigations and simulation studies. Related software will be developed for free dissemination. Data sets from ongoing autism research, Alzheimer’s disease, and other biomedical studies will be analyzed by using the newly developed methods and the results will be further biologically confirmed and investigated. The research findings will have strong impact on statistical analysis of high throughput big data for biomedical research and on understanding heterogeneity for precision medicine and molecular mechanisms of autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases.

"Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of newly emerging computational tools for data science, biostatisticians need to play a fundamental role in health sciences research. There is an urgent need to encourage US Citizens and Permanent Residents to pursue graduate training in biostatistics. The design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials and observational studies; the setting of regulatory policy; and the conception of laboratory experiments have been shaped by the fundamental contributions of biostatisticians for decades. Advances in genomics, medical imaging technologies, and computational biology; the increasing emphasis on precision and evidence-based medicine; and the widespread adoption of electronic health records; demand the skills of biostatisticians trained to collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary environment and to develop statistical and machine learning methods to address the challenges presented by this data-rich revolutionary era of health sciences research. The proposed summer program which includes world-renowned clinical scientists and biostatisticians from two local universities, will provide an immense opportunity for student participants to learn basic yet modern statistical methods that are critical to uncovering new insights from such big and complex biomedical data and also illustrate the potential pitfalls of confounding and bias that may arise when analyzing biomedical data. A unique feature of the proposed training program is thus to expose the participants to not only basic statistical methods but also to the topics of computer science and bioinformatics which will be invaluable in creating the multidisciplinary teams required to tackle the complex research questions that often requires multipronged approaches. The proposed six-week training program will be structured around the NIH's Translation Science Spectrum and will introduce participants to opportunities in biostatistics through the lens of the science advanced by the contributions of biostatisticians. Following an initial set of weeks on basic training of biostatistical methods, the program will culminate in a data hack-a-thon style competition in which participants will employ the statistical and scientific knowledge gained during the program to produce the most innovative, statistically-sound, scientifically-relevant and effectively-communicated response to a set of research questions. The proposed research education program will enroll up to 20 such participants from across the nation and, through lectures, field trips, and opportunities to analyze data from real health sciences, inspire them to pursue graduate training. The program will draw upon considerable past collaborations and complementary resources of two local world-renowned universities to provide participants with an unparalleled view of the field, including award-winning instructors, internationally known methodological and clinical researchers, and a local area rich in opportunities to showcase careers in biostatistics. Special efforts will be made to enroll participants from underrepresented groups. Participants will be followed after completion, and the numbers attending graduate school in statistics and pursuing biostatistics careers will be documented. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biostatisticians are indispensible contributors to health sciences research. The demand for professionals with advanced training in biostatistics is high and will continue to increase, especially with the expanding challenges posed by big biomedical data.

"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program.

"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,9767837,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories', 'violence exposure']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2019,138258,0.0823791260775518
"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9852112,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,413898,0.08574599192210977
"Fisk University/UIUC-Mayo KnowENG BD2K Center R25 Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed Fisk- UIUC KnowEnG R25 program is to recruit and retain a cadre of under-represented minority scientists prepared to compete for PhD training in biomedical research with already acquired confidence in the use of Big Data.

"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the LSUHSC-NO PREP is to prepare individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who have recently completed their baccalaureate science degrees, for successful enrollment, retention, and completion of a PhD or MD-PhD training program.

"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases.

Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),9675348,UG3NS106899,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Drug Targeting', 'FAIR principles', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'bench to bedside', 'biobehavior', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'productivity loss', 'repository', 'response to injury', 'spinal cord and brain injury', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UG3,2019,240508,0.026225105271766292
"A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias BCR-ABL1 positive leukemias account for a substantial portion of adult leukemia. Tyrosine kinase  inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically changed survival outlook. However, current protocols recommend  patients receive TKI chemotherapy agents indefinitely, causing long-term toxicity and substantive  quality of life deficits, leading to decreased TKI compliance. Moreover, >50% of patients who stop  TKIs ultimately relapse and are not as responsive to post-relapse treatment; additionally, mutation  resistance is becoming an increasing issue with TKIs as patients live longer. It is hypothesized  patient heterogeneity within BCR-ABL1 leukemias are a major driving factor on outcome and strongly  influences optimal TKI selection and cessation. However, small cohort size and disease rarity has  impacted large, pragmatic clinical trials, necessitating a big data approach. The overall goal is  to quilt together individual studies to produce a comprehensive view of BCR-ABL1 leukemias that  includes epidemiology, etiology, assessment, and therapy, as well their inter-relationships. With  a comprehensive view, personalized, predictive medicine becomes possible. This project utilizes  literature mining and “big data” techniques to analyze four major categories: epidemiology (who  gets BCR-ABL1 leukemias, how response correlates to patient characteristics, etc.); etiology (what  factors trigger mutation, mechanisms to improve TKI specificity, preclinical model metrics,  prognostic indicators of recurrence/relapse, etc.); assessment (identifying new  diagnostic/prognostic metrics, improving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols, objective  staging criteria); and treatment (aggregate effect sizes among different therapies, short and  long-term side effect profiles, TKI selection protocols, adjunctive and combination therapies,  criteria for TKI cessation, etc.). The specific aims of the project include: 1) prototype a data  path and construct infrastructure for BCR-ABL1 data curation from literature and/or clinical  sources; 2) construct literature ontological field map to quantify topic depth, aggregate data, and  identify relationships within and between categories; 3) perform exploratory analysis to assess  aggregate statistical power and prototype predictive models for TKI optimization. In summary, the  present project delivers a 21st century, big data approach for BCR-ABL1 leukemia to optimize  clinical management and expedite basic preclinical research. This project is highly relevant to public health as it enables a comprehensive view of BCR ABL  positive leukemia(s) that can optimize clinical management and expedite preclinical research.",A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias,9728205,R21CA232249,"['ABL1 gene', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dimensions', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sample Size', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'Universities', 'Wheelchairs', 'adult leukemia', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'compliance behavior', 'data mining', 'database schema', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'drug intolerance', 'drug intolerant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'lexical', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'rare cancer', 'relational database', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'side effect', 'text searching', 'treatment duration']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,167262,0.05086039626842844

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9747894,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2019,215352,0.030915272147712062

A major goal of this GRC is to promote exceptional early career and female investigators, as well as those of traditionally underrepresented populations, to ensure the continued growth in diversity of scholars in our vibrant community. A diverse range of invited speakers and discussion leaders will present a comprehensive vision of critical and emerging nanotechnology research advances across the field of agricultural science. The program illustrates a targeted excellent diversity of leadership (6), speakers (23), and discussion leaders (11) across the spectrum of: i) gender diversity (19 females, 21 males); ii) USA (24) /International participation (16), representing Austria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, India, Italy, Korea, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, and Taiwan; and iii) industry and government (3), which includes the FDA, FAO, a founder of a blockchain startup company, and senior research scientist at a non-governmental organization. The following topics will be included in the program: Food and nutrition, bioinspired and targeted technologies, sensing and tracking, microbiomes, food contact materials and human health and disease. Discussions on the safe deployment of nanotechnology in these areas, public perception and policy, and influence on industry and entrepreneurship are integral to this GRC. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the FDA center responsible for protecting the health of US consumers, will find the following sessions of great interest, Convergence of Nanotechnology with Food & Agriculture; Advances in Nanomaterials; Environmental Nanotechnology; Nano-enabled Approaches to Improving Human & Animal Health; Translation of Nano-Based Science for Application in Food & Agriculture; Big Data, Machine Learning, AI & Modeling; and Nanotechnology's Impact on Food Safety. The significant contributions of this diverse population will provide the strong intellectual infrastructure required to develop safe and sustainable nano-enabled applications in food and agriculture in direct support of the FDA CFSAN goal of ensuring the safety, security, sanitation, and proper labeling of the U.S. food supply. Project Narrative Nanomaterials and nanotechnology are rapidly entering almost every industry around the world. The co-chairs of this GRC envision that the convergence between nanotechnology, biotechnology and information science within plant science, animal science, crop and food science/technology and environmental science will lead to revolutionary advances in improving public health. The successful achievement of this lofty vision requires the profound intellectual commitment of scientists and engineers in a highly integrated engagement across numerous disciplines. Some success examples with a focus on nanotechnology in food include: nano- biosensors for identification of pathogens, toxins and bacteria in foods; identification systems for tracking animal and plant materials from origination to consumption; development of nanotechnology-based foods with lower calories and with less fat, salt and sugar, while retaining flavor and texture; integrated systems for sensing, monitoring and active response intervention for plant and animal production; “smart field systems” to detect, locate, report and direct application of water; precision and controlled release of fertilizers and pesticides; development of plants that exhibit drought resistance and tolerance to salt and excess moisture; and nanoscale films for food packaging and contact materials that extend shelf life, retain quality, and reduce cooling requirements. Overall, nanoscale science and engineering has an important role in creating a safer and more productive agriculture and food system. Commercial advances and technological impacts have been limited somewhat due to the relative “newness” of nanotechnology in agriculture and food systems. Given that research at the nanoscale in agriculture and food systems is only into its second decade, safety of nano-enabled applications in agriculture are still up for debate. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the FDA center responsible for protecting the health of US consumers, will find the following sessions of great interest, Convergence of Nanotechnology with Food & Agriculture; Advances in Nanomaterials; Environmental Nanotechnology; Nano-enabled Approaches to Improving Human & Animal Health; Translation of Nano-Based Science for Application in Food & Agriculture; Big Data, Machine Learning, AI & Modeling; and Nanotechnology's Impact on Food Safety. In the spirit of the GRC mission, the 2020 Nano Ag & Food GRC and GRS will again bring together a diverse array of scientists and engineers, both senior and junior, postdocs, and graduate students from academia, as well as scientists and engineers from business, government, and Non-governmental organizations (NGOs); with an emphasis to attract researchers from around the world to engage in open scientific exchange.

"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: engaging and affordable robots with artificial software brains based on the latest neuroscience research. The robots and associated lesson plans will enable students to learn neuroscience by creating artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,9838650,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2019,225000,0.029803447499970295
"Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration There is an enormous deficit in students’ understanding of fractions in the United States. Fifth grade fraction knowledge predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Therefore, addressing this deficit is a particularly important area for early intervention. With this Fast-Track grant, Deep Fractions Learning , we propose to transform the way in which students learn core math curriculum so that materials are more interactive and engaging, promote deeper learning of content, and are aligned with the Common Core. More specifically, we will develop and evaluate a digital curriculum for grades 3-5 covering the fractions domain that combines games, collaboration, and an inquiry approach. We propose to develop an innovative technology infrastructure that will integrate Teachley learning games, Success for All’s (SFA) cooperative learning framework, and rigorous lesson content. We will integrate research into the design process and work with Johns Hopkins University to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Outcomes. The intervention will encourage four direct outcomes for students, namely improved: 1) conceptual understanding of fractions, 2) procedural fluency with fractions operations, 3) mathematical justification, and 4) motivation. First, the curriculum will build both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency, providing strong visual models within engaging games that motivate students to practice. The collaborative learning model and inquiry approach will improve students’ mathematical justification. Finally, we encourage these outcomes within a motivational support structure designed to foster engagement and self-efficacy. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in the area of fractions during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since each additional math class students complete in high school more than doubles the odds of college completion (Adelman, 2006), the intervention has the potential to make a real difference in whether students achieve sustainable careers versus being stuck in low-wage jobs. Fractions knowledge in the fifth grade strongly predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Intervention in this essential content area will improve students’ math ability in the short and long term, which in turn will lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as greater high school graduation rates and college attendance.","Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration",9789518,R44GM130162,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Common Core', 'Control Groups', 'Demographic Factors', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graduation Rates', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Mathematics Curriculum', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Wages', 'Work', 'boys', 'career', 'college', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'girls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mathematical ability', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reading ability', 'success', 'teacher', 'third grade', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,463456,0.06628396618665668
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning; however, these props are fundamentally limited.",Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers,9851024,R44GM130247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Promotion and Education', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Support Groups', 'System', 'Teaching Method', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'animation', 'career', 'college', 'commercialization', 'design', 'digital media', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lectures', 'machine vision', 'mid-career faculty', 'mixed reality', 'pedagogy', 'prototype', 'retention rate', 'science education', 'software systems']",NIGMS,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2019,782476,0.05573877560464253
"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9778578,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2019,225000,0.09289375239638206
"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification. This is particularly important for science, given the fact that students from high- poverty schools are economically disadvantaged and may comprise a large proportion of individuals from minority groups that are underrepresented in science.",Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram,9605786,R25ES028974,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Case Study', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High School Faculty', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'K-12 Faculty', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Predisposition', 'Program Development', 'Program Evaluation', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'STEM career', 'School Teachers', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Teaching Method', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'apprenticeship', 'base', 'college', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'design', 'environmental stressor', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'exposure route', 'health literacy', 'health science research', 'high school program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experience', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pedagogical content', 'programs', 'response', 'science teacher', 'skills', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'stressor', 'summer research', 'teacher', 'tool']",NIEHS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2019,99506,0.033336545821073114
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,9544939,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2018,210165,0.060844257098268933
"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,9674585,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,289700,0.04070155805429426
"Adapting the Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack to Genomics and Health Project Summary We propose building a computational platform based on the high performance Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack (BDAS) to support a new ecosystem of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) applications. This platform will make it faster, easier, and less expensive to develop molecular Clinical Decision Support Systems. These systems require real-time queries of globally distributed data, efficient machine learning on large genomic datasets, and must be secure, fault-tolerant and scalable. BDAS and associated technologies are designed to help us meet these challenges and are therefore ideal building blocks to help us create our computational platform. To encourage the adoption of standards for the querying and sharing of large genomic datasets, we will adapt the BDAS stack to support the standards of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). Project Narrative Funding this work will help establish a production quality FOSS implementation of the important Global Alliance for Genomics and Health standards.

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems.

"Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud PROJECT SUMMARY Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of big data. Public cloud vendors provide computing as-a-utility enabling users to pay only for the resources that are actually used. In this application, we will develop methods and tools to enable biomedical researchers to optimize the costs of cloud computing when analyzing biomedical big data. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud provides computing as a utility, on-demand, to end users, enabling cloud resources to be rapidly provisioned and scaled to meet computational and performance requirements. In addition, dynamic intelligent allocation of cloud computing resources has great potential to both improve performance and reduce hosting costs. Unfortunately, determining the most cost-effective and efficient ways to deploy modules on the cloud is non- trivial, due to a plethora of cloud vendors, each providing different types of virtual machines with different capabilities, performance trade-offs, and pricing structures. In addition, modern bioinformatics workflows consist of multiple modules, applications and libraries, each with their own set of software dependencies. Software containers package binary executables and scripts into modules with their software dependencies. With containers that compartmentalize software dependencies, modules implemented as containers can be mixed and matched to create workflows that give identical results on any platform. The high degree of reproducibility and flexibility of software containers makes them ideal instruments for disseminating complex bioinformatics workflows. Our overarching goal is to deliver the latest technological advances in containers and cloud computing to a typical biomedical researcher with limited resources who works with big data. Specifically, we will develop a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface to enable biomedical researchers to build and edit containerized workflows. Most importantly, users can choose to deploy and scale selected modules in the workflow on cloud computing platforms in a transparent, yet guided fashion, to optimize cost and performance. Our aim is to provide a federated approach that leverages resources from multiple cloud vendors. We have assembled a team of interdisciplinary scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, cloud and distributed computing, and machine learning. As part of this application, we will work closely with end users who routinely generate and analyze RNA-seq data. We will illustrate how our containerized, cloud-enabled methods and tools will benefit bioinformatics analyses. Project Narrative Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenge of analyzing diverse and massive data generated to advance our understanding of health and diseases.

"Statistical Methods for Ultrahigh-dimensional Biomedical Data This proposal develops novel statistics and machine learning methods for distributed analysis of big data in biomedical studies and precision medicine and for selecting a small group of molecules that are associated with biological and clinical outcomes from high-throughput data such as microarray, proteomic, and next generation sequence from biomedical research, especially for autism studies and Alzheimer’s disease research. It focuses on developing efficient distributed statistical methods for Big Data computing, storage, and communication, and for solving distributed health data collected at different locations that are hard to aggregate in meta-analysis due to privacy and ownership concerns. It develops both computationally and statistically efficient methods and valid statistical tools for exploring heterogeneity of big data in precision medicine, for studying associations of genomics and genetic information with clinical and biological outcomes, and for feature selection and model building in presence of errors-in- variables, endogeneity, and heavy-tail error distributions, and for predicting clinical outcomes and understanding molecular mechanisms. It introduces more robust and powerful statistical tests for selection of significant genes, SNPs, and proteins in presence of dependence of data, valid control of false discovery rate for dependent test statistics, and evaluation of treatment effects on a group of molecules. The strength and weakness of each proposed method will be critically analyzed via theoretical investigations and simulation studies. Related software will be developed for free dissemination. Data sets from ongoing autism research, Alzheimer’s disease, and other biomedical studies will be analyzed by using the newly developed methods and the results will be further biologically confirmed and investigated. The research findings will have strong impact on statistical analysis of high throughput big data for biomedical research and on understanding heterogeneity for precision medicine and molecular mechanisms of autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases.

"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization.

"QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a combination of innovative statistical and data visualization approaches using patient-generated health data, including mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable devices and smartphones, and patient-reported outcomes, to improve outcomes for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). This research will offer new insights into how to process and transform patient-generated health data into precise lifestyle recommendations to help achieve remission of symptoms. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To develop new preprocessing methods for publicly available, heterogeneous, time-varied mHealth data to develop a high quality mHealth dataset; 2) To develop and apply novel machine learning methods to obtain accurate predictions and formal statistical inference for the influence of lifestyle features on disease activity in IBDs; and 3) To design and develop innovative, interactive data visualization tools for knowledge discovery. The methods developed in the areas of preprocessing of mHealth data, calibration for mHealth devices, machine learning, and interactive data visualization will be broadly applicable to other mHealth data, chronic conditions beyond IBDs, and other fields in which the data streams are highly variable, intermittent, and periodic. This work is highly relevant to the mission of the NIH BD2K initiative which supports the development of innovative and transformative approaches and tools to accelerate the integration of Big Data and data science into biomedical research. This project will also enhance training in the development and use of methods for biomedical Big Data science and mentor the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists. The proposed research is relevant to public health by seeking to improve symptoms for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, which are chronic, life-long conditions with waxing and waning symptoms.

"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9523223,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,144298,0.05343755256799493

Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program.

"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,9569278,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories', 'violence exposure']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2018,139005,0.0823791260775518

"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the LSUHSC-NO PREP is to prepare individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who have recently completed their baccalaureate science degrees, for successful enrollment, retention, and completion of a PhD or MD-PhD training program.

"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases. This project combines big data processing expertise from particle physics, computer science and machine learning to address these confounds, providing a more accurate process to enable clinical translation of this new biomarker and potentially improve clinical outcomes.",Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy,9534672,K01ES026839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manpower and Training', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Energy', 'Nuclear Physics', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer cluster', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'patient population', 'patient variability', 'physical science', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'signal processing', 'spatial temporal variation', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'surgery outcome', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'vigilance']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2018,148964,0.09116927616371373
"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),9547665,UG3NS106899,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Drug Targeting', 'FAIR principles', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'bench to bedside', 'biobehavior', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'productivity loss', 'repository', 'response to injury', 'spinal cord and brain injury', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UG3,2018,239813,0.026225105271766292
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.

"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing integrated EMR early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early with the intent to ultimately refie the process of care for this group to minimize complication development.",Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data,9530647,K01ES026834,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood coagulation', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deltastab', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'career', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'injured', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'smartphone Application', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2018,221740,0.06681320429177975
"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The short term goals of this K01 award are to provide training for Dr. Farhat in critical aspects of data science, computational and evolutionary biology, advanced biostatistics and network science. Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai.

In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9530648,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2018,220530,0.030915272147712062
"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: engaging and affordable robots with artificial software brains based on the latest neuroscience research. The robots and associated lesson plans will enable students to learn neuroscience by creating artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. By giving teachers and students access to neurorobotic technologies previously only available in research labs, we aim to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians.",Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots,9622419,R43NS108850,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cellular Phone', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Future Teacher', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Next Generation Science Standards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain tract', 'commercialization', 'computational reasoning', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'gaze', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'preference', 'project-based learning', 'science education', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'teacher', 'tool', 'twelfth grade']",NINDS,"BACKYARD BRAINS, INC.",R43,2018,386013,0.03518532926229866
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification.

"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,9346652,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2017,204981,0.060844257098268933
"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio) statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offer and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from four different departments within four different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts, and Information Science in the School of Information. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high-dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and response for our pilot offering in 2015 with 153 applications for 20 positions and a yield rate of 80% from the offers we extended. We plan to build on the success of this initial offering in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2016-2018). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a no-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 30 undergraduates nationally and expose them to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by UM researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder. In this project, we propose to develop a fully automatic image post-processing pipeline and multidimensional big data analyses based on machine learning techniques, with the aim to uncover latent information from complex dataset and with the ultimate goal of setting up a platform for OA precision medicine",Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis,9385849,K99AR070902,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'California', 'Cartilage', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Institutes', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'career development', 'cartilage degradation', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging scientist', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'kinematics', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'parallel processing', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'racial difference', 'repository', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2017,94041,-0.004729277052773275
"Adapting the Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack to Genomics and Health Project Summary We propose building a computational platform based on the high performance Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack (BDAS) to support a new ecosystem of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) applications. This platform will make it faster, easier, and less expensive to develop molecular Clinical Decision Support Systems. These systems require real-time queries of globally distributed data, efficient machine learning on large genomic datasets, and must be secure, fault-tolerant and scalable. BDAS and associated technologies are designed to help us meet these challenges and are therefore ideal building blocks to help us create our computational platform. To encourage the adoption of standards for the querying and sharing of large genomic datasets, we will adapt the BDAS stack to support the standards of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). Project Narrative Funding this work will help establish a production quality FOSS implementation of the important Global Alliance for Genomics and Health standards.

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,9349475,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2017,305372,0.07279790108536786
"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

"The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to establish a national short course in Big Data Image Processing & Analysis (BigDIPA) intended to increase the number and overall skills of competent research scientists now encountering large, complex image data sources derived from cutting edge biological/biomedical research approaches. Extraction of knowledge from these imaging sources requires specialized skills and an interdisciplinary mindset. Yet effective training opportunities of this sector of the ""Big Data"" science community are glaringly underappreciated and underserved compared to other big data fields such as omics. UC Irvine is ideally suited to host a short course to address this thematic training deficit on account of the synergistic colocalization between multiple facilities, renowned for development of numerous advanced imaging techniques, and the outstanding instructional environment provided by faculty with collaborative expertise in biological image processing and computer vision, bioinformatics and high performance computational approaches.  Specifically, our BigDIPA proposal assembles an interdisciplinary alliance of faculty experts that can leverage the preeminent imaging resource facilities, such as the Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) and the Beckman Laser Institute, and fuse these to ongoing campus big data initiatives, e.g. UCI's Data Science Initiative, to create a top-rated training course designed for senior graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty and industry scientists from diverse scientific disciplines who have nascent interests and needs to handle BIG DATA sources beyond their current level of competency.  The course theme is focused to utilize discreet examples drawn from the analysis of complex data acquired from different microscopy imaging modalities employed to investigate dynamics in cellular and tissue processes, including signal transduction networks, development, neuroscience and biomedical applications, and that hereto where hidden or inaccessible to standard methods of analysis. Participants will be guided along the complete acquisition- processing-analysis pipeline through exposure to a coherent progression of topics and issues typically encountered when handling BIG DATA. We believe this training approach will therefore be attractive to a broad and significant untapped pool of researchers from the biological disciplines, biomedical engineering, systems biology, math, biophysics, computer science, bioinformatics and statistics who possess some, but not all, of the requisite competencies to effectively traverse the BD2K landscape. We have designed the course such that skills and experience gained by trainees will be transferable to their own research interests.  The BigDIPA course format will combine didactic lectures on the theory and foundational frameworks that underpin each step, with practical instruction on implementation and hands-on tutorials in image acquisition, large data handling, basic scripting of computational tools, image processing on high performance computing architectures, as well as feature extraction, evaluation and visualization of results. The course is designed to offer an intense learning experience delivered in a compact time frame, and opportunities to foster interdisciplinary interactions through small team exercises. Participants will also be encouraged to take advantage of pre-courses - separate and distinct training opportunities not funded by this proposal - that will be coordinated to directly precede our course. This unique format provides multiple benefits: it provides an efficient mechanism to address individual participant training deficiencies to permit a more productive experience in the BigDIPA course, adds no-cost mutual benefits to independent but synergistic programs, and facilitates recruitment of applicants who frequently feel interested but intimidated due to a perceived lack of prior adequate training.

"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,9278954,R25MH112480,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Habits', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'design', 'e-science', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'lectures', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'project-based learning', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer institute', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2017,205185,0.028894750108159707
"QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a combination of innovative statistical and data visualization approaches using patient-generated health data, including mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable devices and smartphones, and patient-reported outcomes, to improve outcomes for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). This research will offer new insights into how to process and transform patient-generated health data into precise lifestyle recommendations to help achieve remission of symptoms. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To develop new preprocessing methods for publicly available, heterogeneous, time-varied mHealth data to develop a high quality mHealth dataset; 2) To develop and apply novel machine learning methods to obtain accurate predictions and formal statistical inference for the influence of lifestyle features on disease activity in IBDs; and 3) To design and develop innovative, interactive data visualization tools for knowledge discovery. The methods developed in the areas of preprocessing of mHealth data, calibration for mHealth devices, machine learning, and interactive data visualization will be broadly applicable to other mHealth data, chronic conditions beyond IBDs, and other fields in which the data streams are highly variable, intermittent, and periodic. This work is highly relevant to the mission of the NIH BD2K initiative which supports the development of innovative and transformative approaches and tools to accelerate the integration of Big Data and data science into biomedical research. This project will also enhance training in the development and use of methods for biomedical Big Data science and mentor the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists. The proposed research is relevant to public health by seeking to improve symptoms for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, which are chronic, life-long conditions with waxing and waning symptoms. Developing novel statistical and visualization methods to provide a more nuanced understanding of the precise relationship between physical activity and sleep to disease activity is relevant to BD2K's mission.",QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine ,9394127,R01EB025024,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health Care Research', 'Imagery', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Activity', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'clinical remission', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'health care quality', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'mHealth', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,338637,0.04458532869181196
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9310000,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,144298,0.05343755256799493
"A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inception of the BD2K Initiative is a testament to the foresight of NIH and our community. Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data. Capitalizing on our investigators' complementary strengths in computational biology and cardiovascular medicine, we will present a fusion of cutting-edge innovations that are grounded in a cardiovascular research focus, encompassing: (i) on-the-cloud data processing, (ii) crowd sourcing and text-mining data annotation, (iii) protein spatiotemporal dynamics, (iv) multi-omic integration, and (v) multiscale clinical data modeling. Drawing from our decade of experience in creating and refining bioinformatics tools, we propose to amalgamate established Big Data resources into a generalizable model for data annotation and collaborative research, through a new query system and cloud infrastructure for accessing multiple omics repositories, and through computational-supported crowdsourcing initiatives for mining the biomedical literature. We propose to interweave diverse data types for revealing biological networks that coalesce from molecular entities at multiple scales, through machine learning methods for structuring molecular data and defining relationships with drugs and diseases, and through novel algorithms for on-the-cloud integration and pathway visualization of multi-dimensional molecular data. Moreover, we propose to innovate advanced modeling tools to resolve protein dynamics and spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms, through mechanistic modeling of protein properties and 3D protein expression maps, and through Bayesian algorithms that correlate patient phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles. The utility and customizability o our tools to the broader research population is clearly demonstrated using three archetypical workflows that enable annotations of large lists of genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites; powerful analysis of complex protein datasets acquired over time; and seamless aQoregation of diverse molecular, textual and literature data. These workflows will be rigorously validated using data from two significant clinical cohorts, the Jackson Heart Study and the Healthy Elderly Longevity (Wellderly). In parallel, a multifaceted strategy will be implemented to educate and train biomedical investigators, and to engage the public for promoting the overall BD2K initiative. We are convinced that a community-driven BD2K initiative will best realize its scientific potential and transform the research culture in a sustainable manner, exhibiting lasting success beyond the current funding period.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The challenges of biomedical Big Data are multifaceted. Biomedical investigators face daunting tasks of storing, analyzing, and distributing large-scale omics data, and aggregating all information to discern mechanistic insights. A coherent effort is required to harness disarrayed Big Data and transform them into intelligible scientific facts, whil engaging the global community via education and outreach programs.

"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This program focuses on the development and dissemination of online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health.

"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,9431875,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Child health care', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependency', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2017,139492,0.0823791260775518

"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases. This project combines big data processing expertise from particle physics, computer science and machine learning to address these confounds, providing a more accurate process to enable clinical translation of this new biomarker and potentially improve clinical outcomes.",Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy,9322204,K01ES026839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manpower and Training', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Energy', 'Nuclear Physics', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer cluster', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'patient population', 'physical science', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'signal processing', 'spatial temporal variation', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'vigilance']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2017,148964,0.09116927616371373
"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the LSUHSC-NO PREP is to prepare individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who have recently completed their baccalaureate science degrees, for successful enrollment, retention, and completion of a PhD or MD-PhD training program. We aim to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by preparing PREP Scholars for the rigors and challenges of a biomedical doctoral degree program so that they will successfully obtain a PhD degree or MD/PhD degree and contribute their expertise to the biomedical scientific community.",LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences,9208463,R25GM121189,"['Academic Training', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Cities', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data Analyses', 'Degree program', 'Dentistry', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Extramural Activities', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Historically Black Colleges and Universities', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Louisiana', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Enrollment', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Oral', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Study Skills', 'Sum', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'education research', 'experience', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'gulf coast', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'member', 'minority communities', 'novel', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'role model', 'science education', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student', 'university student']",NIGMS,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R25,2017,255172,0.06550054616253498
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9333122,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2017,401742,0.07365086375030591
"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data.

She is completing a masters of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in 5/2015. She has spent the last 4.5 years acquiring skills in Mycobacterium tuberculosis biology, epidemiology, bioinformatics and biostatistics. She has experience in the analysis of whole genome sequence data, drug resistance data and patient clinical outcome data with the focus of identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic determinants of drug resistance. She has also developed new methods in this area. Dr. Farhat has 11 publications 5 of which are first author including high impact and highly cited work in the journals Nature Genetics, Genome Medicine and the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. The short term goals of this K01 award are to provide training for Dr. Farhat in critical aspects of data science, computational and evolutionary biology, advanced biostatistics and network science. Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai. Dr. Murray, the principal mentor on this proposal has mentored over 38 trainees, 9 of which have went on to have independent research careers, and 6 competed successfully for K awards. She is also PI on two recently awarded NIH/NIAID grants a CETR U19 and a TBRU U19 and has over 350 peer reviewed publications. To complement the expertise of her mentors Dr. Farhat will be advised by Dr. Christiani a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician and world renowned researcher in the field of lung and environmental genetics. She will also collaborate and consult with Dr. Merce Crosas, a data scientist, and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist. She will rotate through Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri's bioinformatics laboratory to diversify her exposure to biomedical Big Data. In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9326841,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2017,225549,0.030915272147712062
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The  Training  Program  in  Computational  Neuroscience  (TPCN)  will  support  integrated   undergraduate  and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted  by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of  Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of  Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is  one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a  Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has  hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS  established an undergraduate major in  neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now  has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and  the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the  neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As  NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS   and  the  School  of  Medicine),  this training grant will ensure that computational modeling,  which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate  program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to  Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with  these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques  for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed  training  program will support coherent undergraduate  and  graduate  training  in   computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship  methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human  factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers.  (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed  specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose  innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit  modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees  for jobs not only in academia, but  also  in  medical  and  industry research. To achieve this, we  will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational  neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have  complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in  mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry.  Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,9316750,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2016,204981,0.060844257098268933

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,9322706,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Camping', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2016,316840,0.07279790108536786

Participants will work together in teams in order to apply the skills that they develop in each module to important problems drawn from relevant case studies.  The primary audience for SISBID will consist of biomedical scientists who would like to develop the statistical and computational training needed to make use of Biomedical Big Data. The secondary audience will consist of individuals with stronger statistical or computational backgrounds but little exposure to biology, who will learn how to apply their skills to problems associated with Biomedical Big Data. Participants will include advanced undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and researchers, and will be drawn from industry, government, and academia. In order to ensure that all participants are able to fully engage in the program, participants will be expected to already have some prior background in R programming and statistical inference, which can be obtained by taking two free online courses before the program begins.  Each of the five modules will be co-taught by two instructors. The ten instructors will be drawn from top universities and research centers across the U.S., such as the University of Washington, Rice University, University of Iowa, Johns Hopkins University, MD Anderson Cancer Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and University of North Carolina. They have been selected based on research expertise and excellence in teaching.  Lecture videos and slides will be made freely available online so that individuals who are unable to attend SISBID in person can still benefit from the program.  This proposal specifically requests funds for 55 student / postdoctoral fellow travel scholarships per year, 130 student / postdoctoral fellow registration scholarships per year, instructor travel and stipends, teaching assistant stipends, and PI salary support. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   In recent years, the biomedical sciences have been inundated by Big Data, such as DNA sequence data and electronic medical records. In principle, it should be possible to use such data for a variety of tasks, such as predicting an individual's risk of developing diabetes or cancer, and tailoring therapies to an individual should he or she become ill. The Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data will provide biomedical researchers with the computational and statistical training needed in order to take advantage of Big Data, so that they can more effectively use it to understand human diseases and to improve human health.",Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data,9063061,R25EB020380,"['Academia', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Center', 'Case Study', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Government', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'North Carolina', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rice', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Slide', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomedical scientist', 'data visualization', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'improved', 'instructor', 'learning materials', 'lectures', 'massive open online courses', 'member', 'online course', 'open source', 'programs', 'skills', 'statistics', 'summer institute', 'teacher', 'teaching assistant', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2016,159605,0.12535969821134618
"The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to establish a national short course in Big Data Image Processing & Analysis (BigDIPA) intended to increase the number and overall skills of competent research scientists now encountering large, complex image data sources derived from cutting edge biological/biomedical research approaches. Extraction of knowledge from these imaging sources requires specialized skills and an interdisciplinary mindset. Yet effective training opportunities of this sector of the ""Big Data"" science community are glaringly underappreciated and underserved compared to other big data fields such as omics. UC Irvine is ideally suited to host a short course to address this thematic training deficit on account of the synergistic colocalization between multiple facilities, renowned for development of numerous advanced imaging techniques, and the outstanding instructional environment provided by faculty with collaborative expertise in biological image processing and computer vision, bioinformatics and high performance computational approaches.  Specifically, our BigDIPA proposal assembles an interdisciplinary alliance of faculty experts that can leverage the preeminent imaging resource facilities, such as the Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) and the Beckman Laser Institute, and fuse these to ongoing campus big data initiatives, e.g. UCI's Data Science Initiative, to create a top-rated training course designed for senior graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty and industry scientists from diverse scientific disciplines who have nascent interests and needs to handle BIG DATA sources beyond their current level of competency.  The course theme is focused to utilize discreet examples drawn from the analysis of complex data acquired from different microscopy imaging modalities employed to investigate dynamics in cellular and tissue processes, including signal transduction networks, development, neuroscience and biomedical applications, and that hereto where hidden or inaccessible to standard methods of analysis. Participants will be guided along the complete acquisition- processing-analysis pipeline through exposure to a coherent progression of topics and issues typically encountered when handling BIG DATA. We believe this training approach will therefore be attractive to a broad and significant untapped pool of researchers from the biological disciplines, biomedical engineering, systems biology, math, biophysics, computer science, bioinformatics and statistics who possess some, but not all, of the requisite competencies to effectively traverse the BD2K landscape. We have designed the course such that skills and experience gained by trainees will be transferable to their own research interests.  The BigDIPA course format will combine didactic lectures on the theory and foundational frameworks that underpin each step, with practical instruction on implementation and hands-on tutorials in image acquisition, large data handling, basic scripting of computational tools, image processing on high performance computing architectures, as well as feature extraction, evaluation and visualization of results. The course is designed to offer an intense learning experience delivered in a compact time frame, and opportunities to foster interdisciplinary interactions through small team exercises. Participants will also be encouraged to take advantage of pre-courses - separate and distinct training opportunities not funded by this proposal - that will be coordinated to directly precede our course. This unique format provides multiple benefits: it provides an efficient mechanism to address individual participant training deficiencies to permit a more productive experience in the BigDIPA course, adds no-cost mutual benefits to independent but synergistic programs, and facilitates recruitment of applicants who frequently feel interested but intimidated due to a perceived lack of prior adequate training.  Beyond providing an intensive on-site training course, all course materials (lecture notes, video lectures and tutorials), tutorial exercises, open source software resources and sample datasets will be made freely available through on-line distribution to maximize outreach and encourage additional contributions of curated training resources solicited from the community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to train and expand the cadre of researchers capable of effectively using the deluge of complex BIG DATA being generated by advanced biomedical imaging approaches. These data sources represent a rich source of complex information relevant to many scientific areas of inquiry, and are informative at multiple scales ranging from fundamental biological processes at the cellular level to patient diagnostics for diseases such as cancer or neurological disorders.",The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis,9150564,R25EB022366,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skills Development', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'biomedical scientist', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'course implementation', 'data acquisition', 'data format', 'demographics', 'design', 'education research', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning materials', 'lecture notes', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'open source', 'outreach', 'programs', 'repository', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tissue processing', 'training opportunity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R25,2016,161997,0.1024721270080885

"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9099840,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,144298,0.05343755256799493
"A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inception of the BD2K Initiative is a testament to the foresight of NIH and our community. Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data. Capitalizing on our investigators' complementary strengths in computational biology and cardiovascular medicine, we will present a fusion of cutting-edge innovations that are grounded in a cardiovascular research focus, encompassing: (i) on-the-cloud data processing, (ii) crowd sourcing and text-mining data annotation, (iii) protein spatiotemporal dynamics, (iv) multi-omic integration, and (v) multiscale clinical data modeling. Drawing from our decade of experience in creating and refining bioinformatics tools, we propose to amalgamate established Big Data resources into a generalizable model for data annotation and collaborative research, through a new query system and cloud infrastructure for accessing multiple omics repositories, and through computational-supported crowdsourcing initiatives for mining the biomedical literature. We propose to interweave diverse data types for revealing biological networks that coalesce from molecular entities at multiple scales, through machine learning methods for structuring molecular data and defining relationships with drugs and diseases, and through novel algorithms for on-the-cloud integration and pathway visualization of multi-dimensional molecular data. Moreover, we propose to innovate advanced modeling tools to resolve protein dynamics and spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms, through mechanistic modeling of protein properties and 3D protein expression maps, and through Bayesian algorithms that correlate patient phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles. The utility and customizability o our tools to the broader research population is clearly demonstrated using three archetypical workflows that enable annotations of large lists of genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites; powerful analysis of complex protein datasets acquired over time; and seamless aQoregation of diverse molecular, textual and literature data. These workflows will be rigorously validated using data from two significant clinical cohorts, the Jackson Heart Study and the Healthy Elderly Longevity (Wellderly). In parallel, a multifaceted strategy will be implemented to educate and train biomedical investigators, and to engage the public for promoting the overall BD2K initiative. We are convinced that a community-driven BD2K initiative will best realize its scientific potential and transform the research culture in a sustainable manner, exhibiting lasting success beyond the current funding period.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The challenges of biomedical Big Data are multifaceted. Biomedical investigators face daunting tasks of storing, analyzing, and distributing large-scale omics data, and aggregating all information to discern mechanistic insights. A coherent effort is required to harness disarrayed Big Data and transform them into intelligible scientific facts, whil engaging the global community via education and outreach programs.

"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases. This project combines big data processing expertise from particle physics, computer science and machine learning to address these confounds, providing a more accurate process to enable clinical translation of this new biomarker and potentially improve clinical outcomes.",Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy,9147594,K01ES026839,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manpower and Training', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Physics', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer cluster', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'patient population', 'physical science', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'signal processing', 'sleep epilepsy', 'spatial temporal variation', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'vigilance']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2016,148644,0.09116927616371373
"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing integrated EMR early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early with the intent to ultimately refie the process of care for this group to minimize complication development.",Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data,9147595,K01ES026834,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood coagulation', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Aging', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'care systems', 'career', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'injured', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'professor', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2016,222942,0.06681320429177975
"Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Biomedical science, higher education, software and technology are simultaneously undergoing tectonic shifts. The amazing pace of software and technological development are driving equally amazing advances in the ability to acquire massive data sets in the biomedical sciences. These new Big Biomedical data sets come in the form of complex measurements, such as that of the brain, genome, proteome and human biome or massive databases, such as with electronic health records. Big Data issues, such as reproducibility of processing, measurement and analysis techniques, are increasingly complex, and crucial. Across all domains there is a knowledge gap of researchers to analyze and interpret these new data sets and the current higher education model cannot meet the insatiable demand for this training. We propose to make substantial progress on these issues in two domains. Specifically, we propose to use Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to create two series, one in neuroimaging and one in genomics. These series will allow for flexible, student paced, low cost scalable training for tens of thousands of students. Along with these series, we propose the creation of modular Big Data biostatistical content that can be used by students as well as teachers. This effort will be parallel to work on an intelligent tutoring syste called swirl. This application proposes to use swirl to create rich, gamified learning environments for students. All of the material created from this grant will be open access and free. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Project narrative: We propose two Massive Open Online Course series in neuroimaging and genomic Big Data analysis as well as the creation of modular Big Data statistics content and content creation for an intelligent tutoring system.","Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems",9061684,R25EB020378,"['Adopted', 'Amaze', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Models', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Sets', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Nurses', 'Public Health Nursing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'big biomedical data', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'course module', 'density', 'educational atmosphere', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'higher education', 'instructor', 'learning materials', 'lectures', 'massive open online courses', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'process repeatability', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'tutoring']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R25,2016,209444,0.11861398287054692
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9103879,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2016,401742,0.07365086375030591
"The q-bio Summer School DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems. The complexity and importance of these systems, which govern cellular activities and fates, provides motivation for developing a scientific and engineering workforce equipped to deal with the complexity.",The q-bio Summer School,9002062,R25GM105608,"['Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Career Mobility', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Professional Competence', 'Qualifying', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biochemical model', 'biological research', 'career', 'career development', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'demographics', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning materials', 'lecture notes', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'peer', 'physical science', 'posters', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,"NEW MEXICO CONSORTIUM, INC.",R25,2016,168780,0.060409682219193704

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9147601,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'power analysis', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2016,49355,0.030915272147712062
"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio) statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offer and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from four different departments within four different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts, and Information Science in the School of Information. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high-dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and response for our pilot offering in 2015 with 153 applications for 20 positions and a yield rate of 80% from the offers we extended. We plan to build on the success of this initial offering in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2016-2018). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a no-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 30 undergraduates nationally and expose them to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by UM researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a six week long summer institute: ""Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data"" to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 30 undergraduates recruited nationally, from 2016-2018.

"THS: Using Twitter and Big Data Analytics to Track and Predict Health Conditions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): U.S. health officials are struggling to manage health conditions, and disease outbreaks (e.g., flu) affecting underserved communities. Yet, early warnings can be found in public postings made by citizens of these communities in social apps like Twitter. Recent studies from the Pew Research Center indicate that minorities are as likely to own a mobile phone as non-minorities, and are avid users of social apps. Since public Twitter posts can be searched and accessed without having a ""friendship"" relation with the author, this platform could provide health officials with the analytics capability to track which diseases are being discussed in a given region and at a specific time. Unfortunately, the software tools to perform these analytic tasks are still in the early stages of development. Very often, the expertise to use the required big data software and machine learning programs is not readily available, limiting access to officials working with underserved communities. In this project, we seek to conduct basic research aimed at designing, implementing and testing an open-source research prototype for an integrated and scalable platform to search Twitter posts, and analyze their contents in search for clues about health conditions, thereby understanding the health issues affecting underserved communities, and making predictions about possible health conditions that might affect them in the future. In Aim 1, we will build an automated Twitter data warehouse to collect, index, and query public posts. In Aim 2, we will build a predictive analytics engine that uses social data to make predictions about possible outbreaks of conditions, regions that might be affected and at-risk groups. Finally, in Aim 3, we will build mobile and web apps, with a map-based interface, to query and visualize the health data. The value- added capability of our system is the ability to work as an integrated system to help analyze tweets, visualize data along disease and spatio-temporal attributes, and make predictive analytics, all under one roof. This could have a significant impact on public health disease tracking and response. The University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez (UPRM) is a Hispanic serving institution, with the second largest Hispanic serving engineering school in the U.S. and with 35% female enrollment. This AREA project provides a unique opportunity to train students in social media analysis, big data systems, machine learning, and predictive analytics.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: U.S. health officials are struggling to manage health conditions, and disease outbreaks (e.g., flu) affecting underserved communities. Yet, early warnings can be found in public postings made by citizens of these communities in social apps like Twitter.

"Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data DESCRIPTION:  Funding is sought for the Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data (SISBID) at the University of Washington. This program will provide workshops on the statistical and computational skills needed to access, process, manage, and analyze large biomedical data sets. It will be co-directed by Ali Shojaie and Daniela Witten, faculty in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Washington.  The SISBID program will consist of five 2.5-day in-person courses, or modules, taught at the University of Washington each July. An individual participant can register for whichever set of modules he or she chooses. The five modules are as follows: (1) Accessing Biomedical Big Data; (2) Data Visualization; (3) Supervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (4) Unsupervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (5) Reproducible Research for Biomedical Big Data. Each module will consist of a combination of formal lectures and hands-on computing labs. Participants will work together in teams in order to apply the skills that they develop in each module to important problems drawn from relevant case studies.  The primary audience for SISBID will consist of biomedical scientists who would like to develop the statistical and computational training needed to make use of Biomedical Big Data. The secondary audience will consist of individuals with stronger statistical or computational backgrounds but little exposure to biology, who will learn how to apply their skills to problems associated with Biomedical Big Data. Participants will include advanced undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and researchers, and will be drawn from industry, government, and academia. In order to ensure that all participants are able to fully engage in the program, participants will be expected to already have some prior background in R programming and statistical inference, which can be obtained by taking two free online courses before the program begins.  Each of the five modules will be co-taught by two instructors. The ten instructors will be drawn from top universities and research centers across the U.S., such as the University of Washington, Rice University, University of Iowa, Johns Hopkins University, MD Anderson Cancer Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and University of North Carolina. They have been selected based on research expertise and excellence in teaching.  Lecture videos and slides will be made freely available online so that individuals who are unable to attend SISBID in person can still benefit from the program.  This proposal specifically requests funds for 55 student / postdoctoral fellow travel scholarships per year, 130 student / postdoctoral fellow registration scholarships per year, instructor travel and stipends, teaching assistant stipends, and PI salary support. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   In recent years, the biomedical sciences have been inundated by Big Data, such as DNA sequence data and electronic medical records. In principle, it should be possible to use such data for a variety of tasks, such as predicting an individual's risk of developing diabetes or cancer, and tailoring therapies to an individual should he or she become ill. The Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data will provide biomedical researchers with the computational and statistical training needed in order to take advantage of Big Data, so that they can more effectively use it to understand human diseases and to improve human health.",Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data,8935790,R25EB020380,"['Academia', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Center', 'Case Study', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Government', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'North Carolina', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rice', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Slide', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'data visualization', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'improved', 'instructor', 'lectures', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2015,159605,0.12535969821134618
"The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to establish a national short course in Big Data Image Processing & Analysis (BigDIPA) intended to increase the number and overall skills of competent research scientists now encountering large, complex image data sources derived from cutting edge biological/biomedical research approaches. Extraction of knowledge from these imaging sources requires specialized skills and an interdisciplinary mindset. Yet effective training opportunities of this sector of the ""Big Data"" science community are glaringly underappreciated and underserved compared to other big data fields such as omics. UC Irvine is ideally suited to host a short course to address this thematic training deficit on account of the synergistic colocalization between multiple facilities, renowned for development of numerous advanced imaging techniques, and the outstanding instructional environment provided by faculty with collaborative expertise in biological image processing and computer vision, bioinformatics and high performance computational approaches.  Specifically, our BigDIPA proposal assembles an interdisciplinary alliance of faculty experts that can leverage the preeminent imaging resource facilities, such as the Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) and the Beckman Laser Institute, and fuse these to ongoing campus big data initiatives, e.g. UCI's Data Science Initiative, to create a top-rated training course designed for senior graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty and industry scientists from diverse scientific disciplines who have nascent interests and needs to handle BIG DATA sources beyond their current level of competency.  The course theme is focused to utilize discreet examples drawn from the analysis of complex data acquired from different microscopy imaging modalities employed to investigate dynamics in cellular and tissue processes, including signal transduction networks, development, neuroscience and biomedical applications, and that hereto where hidden or inaccessible to standard methods of analysis. Participants will be guided along the complete acquisition- processing-analysis pipeline through exposure to a coherent progression of topics and issues typically encountered when handling BIG DATA. We believe this training approach will therefore be attractive to a broad and significant untapped pool of researchers from the biological disciplines, biomedical engineering, systems biology, math, biophysics, computer science, bioinformatics and statistics who possess some, but not all, of the requisite competencies to effectively traverse the BD2K landscape. We have designed the course such that skills and experience gained by trainees will be transferable to their own research interests.  The BigDIPA course format will combine didactic lectures on the theory and foundational frameworks that underpin each step, with practical instruction on implementation and hands-on tutorials in image acquisition, large data handling, basic scripting of computational tools, image processing on high performance computing architectures, as well as feature extraction, evaluation and visualization of results. The course is designed to offer an intense learning experience delivered in a compact time frame, and opportunities to foster interdisciplinary interactions through small team exercises. Participants will also be encouraged to take advantage of pre-courses - separate and distinct training opportunities not funded by this proposal - that will be coordinated to directly precede our course. This unique format provides multiple benefits: it provides an efficient mechanism to address individual participant training deficiencies to permit a more productive experience in the BigDIPA course, adds no-cost mutual benefits to independent but synergistic programs, and facilitates recruitment of applicants who frequently feel interested but intimidated due to a perceived lack of prior adequate training.  Beyond providing an intensive on-site training course, all course materials (lecture notes, video lectures and tutorials), tutorial exercises, open source software resources and sample datasets will be made freely available through on-line distribution to maximize outreach and encourage additional contributions of curated training resources solicited from the community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to train and expand the cadre of researchers capable of effectively using the deluge of complex BIG DATA being generated by advanced biomedical imaging approaches. These data sources represent a rich source of complex information relevant to many scientific areas of inquiry, and are informative at multiple scales ranging from fundamental biological processes at the cellular level to patient diagnostics for diseases such as cancer or neurological disorders.            ",The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis,9044533,R25EB022366,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'biomedical scientist', 'citizen science', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data format', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'lecture notes', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'open source', 'outreach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tissue processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R25,2015,161997,0.1024721270080885

"Developing Cloud-based tools for Big Neural Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Big data has the potential to dramatically advance the electrophysiology biodata sciences in similar ways that it has transformed Genetics. Differences between these two areas dictate separate approaches to apply Big Data tools, and methods in order to provide successful assets to the research community. For one, neural datasets are very heterogeneous by nature. The data is difficult to interpret without knowing specifics about the data acquisition protocol, the experimental paradigm and the physiological state of the recorded subject. Many neural datasets are complemented with complex meta-data sets, which should be an integral component in any effort to integrate and share these data with other researchers. The goal of this project is to develop novel, generalizable Big Data tools to facilitate cloud-base analysis of complex multi-scale neural data. Epilepsy research will be used as a specific use case to guide the development of the tools. A cohort of established senior investigators performing epilepsy research will use and validate these tools in their laboratories. Epilepsy research is currently limited by its narrow focus on single models (animal or human) in individual centers and laboratories. Just as Genetics was revolutionized through Big Data techniques, so too can Epilepsy research be transformed through novel approaches to standardize, share, and mine data across groups of investigators. Over the past several years I have co-developed a NINDS funded cloud-based data platform, ://ieeg.org, giving me a central role in developing Big Data solutions for neural data, such as customized data sharing, large-scale cloud-based data analysis, and search and interrogation techniques for complex data and metadata. My scientific objectives for this project are: (1) to develop generalizable tools to curate, analyze, and interrogate multi-scale neural data, and (2) to create a platform that will galvanize a research community focused on sharing data, and methods to advance Big Data research in the basic and translational neurosciences. Equally important to this proposal, I present a training plan to prepare me for an academic career focused on Big Data in the neurosciences. This plan supplements my background in bioengineering and statistical modeling of neural data with broader data-science expertise in data integration and machine learning, and deeper domain knowledge of the clinical neurosciences. I have assembled a group of collaborators, basic investigators and clinician scientists, who will use the tools developed in this project to analyze and validate their data and methods. I will use the results of this project as the foundation for a R01 Grant application, in which I will expand the developed platform and tools to target other research domains (TBI, Emergency Care, Cardiac), as well as integrate other data-modalities such as Imaging, and Genomics.

"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8935820,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,146944,0.05343755256799493

"Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine DESCRIPTION:  As the era of ""Big Data"" is dawning on biomedical research, multiple types of biomedical data, including phenotypic, molecular (including -omics), clinical, imaging, behavioral, and environmental data is being generated on an unprecedented scale with high volume, variety and velocity. These datasets are increasingly large and complex, challenging our current abilities for data representation, integration and analysis for improving outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. It is well-recognized that the greatest challenge to leveraging the significant potentials of Big Data is in educating and recruiting future computational and data scientists who have the background, training and experience to master fundamental opportunities in biomedical sciences. This demands interdisciplinary education and hands-on practicum training on understanding the application, analysis, limitations, and value of the Big Data. To bridge this knowledge gap for the U.S. biomedical workforce, we propose to develop a research educational program-Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine (BDC4CM)-that will instruct students, fellows and scientists in the use of specific new methods and tools fo Big Data by providing tailored, in-depth instruction, hands-on laboratory modules, and case studies on Big Data access, integration, processing and analysis. Offered by highly interdisciplinary and experienced faculty from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota, this program will provide a short- term training opportunity on Big Data methods and approaches for: 1) data and knowledge representation standards; 2) information extraction and natural language processing; 3) visualization analytics; 4) data mining and predictive modeling; 5) privacy and ethics; and 6) applications in comparative effectiveness research and population health research and improvement. Our primary educational goal is to prepare the next generation of innovators and visionaries in the emerging, multidimensional field of Big Data Science in healthcare, as well as to develop a future workforce that fulfills industry needs and increases U.S. competitiveness in healthcare technologies and applications.

"Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Biomedical science, higher education, software and technology are simultaneously undergoing tectonic shifts. The amazing pace of software and technological development are driving equally amazing advances in the ability to acquire massive data sets in the biomedical sciences. These new Big Biomedical data sets come in the form of complex measurements, such as that of the brain, genome, proteome and human biome or massive databases, such as with electronic health records. Big Data issues, such as reproducibility of processing, measurement and analysis techniques, are increasingly complex, and crucial. Across all domains there is a knowledge gap of researchers to analyze and interpret these new data sets and the current higher education model cannot meet the insatiable demand for this training. We propose to make substantial progress on these issues in two domains. Specifically, we propose to use Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to create two series, one in neuroimaging and one in genomics. These series will allow for flexible, student paced, low cost scalable training for tens of thousands of students. Along with these series, we propose the creation of modular Big Data biostatistical content that can be used by students as well as teachers. This effort will be parallel to work on an intelligent tutoring syste called swirl. This application proposes to use swirl to create rich, gamified learning environments for students. All of the material created from this grant will be open access and free.

"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases. This project combines big data processing expertise from particle physics, computer science and machine learning to address these confounds, providing a more accurate process to enable clinical translation of this new biomarker and potentially improve clinical outcomes.                ",Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy,9041723,K01ES026839,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manpower and Training', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Physics', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer cluster', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'patient population', 'physical science', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'signal processing', 'sleep epilepsy', 'spatial temporal variation', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vigilance']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2015,138213,0.09116927616371373
"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing integrated EMR early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early with the intent to ultimately refie the process of care for this group to minimize complication development.                ",Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data,9043721,K01ES026834,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood coagulation', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Aging', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'care systems', 'career', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'injured', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2015,222898,0.06681320429177975
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,8935802,U54EB020405,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2015,401742,0.07365086375030591
"The q-bio Summer School DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems.

"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. She is completing a masters of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in 5/2015. She has spent the last 4.5 years acquiring skills in Mycobacterium tuberculosis biology, epidemiology, bioinformatics and biostatistics. She has experience in the analysis of whole genome sequence data, drug resistance data and patient clinical outcome data with the focus of identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic determinants of drug resistance. She has also developed new methods in this area. Dr. Farhat has 11 publications 5 of which are first author including high impact and highly cited work in the journals Nature Genetics, Genome Medicine and the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. The short term goals of this K01 award are to provide training for Dr. Farhat in critical aspects of data science, computational and evolutionary biology, advanced biostatistics and network science. Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai. Dr. Murray, the principal mentor on this proposal has mentored over 38 trainees, 9 of which have went on to have independent research careers, and 6 competed successfully for K awards. She is also PI on two recently awarded NIH/NIAID grants a CETR U19 and a TBRU U19 and has over 350 peer reviewed publications. To complement the expertise of her mentors Dr. Farhat will be advised by Dr. Christiani a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician and world renowned researcher in the field of lung and environmental genetics. She will also collaborate and consult with Dr. Merce Crosas, a data scientist, and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist. She will rotate through Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri's bioinformatics laboratory to diversify her exposure to biomedical Big Data. In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.                ",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9044227,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Computational Science', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2015,230806,0.030915272147712062

"Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data     DESCRIPTION:  Funding is sought for the Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data (SISBID) at the University of Washington. This program will provide workshops on the statistical and computational skills needed to access, process, manage, and analyze large biomedical data sets. It will be co-directed by Ali Shojaie and Daniela Witten, faculty in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Washington.  The SISBID program will consist of five 2.5-day in-person courses, or modules, taught at the University of Washington each July. An individual participant can register for whichever set of modules he or she chooses. The five modules are as follows: (1) Accessing Biomedical Big Data; (2) Data Visualization; (3) Supervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (4) Unsupervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (5) Reproducible Research for Biomedical Big Data. Each module will consist of a combination of formal lectures and hands-on computing labs. Participants will work together in teams in order to apply the skills that they develop in each module to important problems drawn from relevant case studies.  The primary audience for SISBID will consist of biomedical scientists who would like to develop the statistical and computational training needed to make use of Biomedical Big Data. The secondary audience will consist of individuals with stronger statistical or computational backgrounds but little exposure to biology, who will learn how to apply their skills to problems associated with Biomedical Big Data. Participants will include advanced undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and researchers, and will be drawn from industry, government, and academia. In order to ensure that all participants are able to fully engage in the program, participants will be expected to already have some prior background in R programming and statistical inference, which can be obtained by taking two free online courses before the program begins.  Each of the five modules will be co-taught by two instructors. The ten instructors will be drawn from top universities and research centers across the U.S., such as the University of Washington, Rice University, University of Iowa, Johns Hopkins University, MD Anderson Cancer Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and University of North Carolina. They have been selected based on research expertise and excellence in teaching.  Lecture videos and slides will be made freely available online so that individuals who are unable to attend SISBID in person can still benefit from the program.  This proposal specifically requests funds for 55 student / postdoctoral fellow travel scholarships per year, 130 student / postdoctoral fellow registration scholarships per year, instructor travel and stipends, teaching assistant stipends, and PI salary support.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   In recent years, the biomedical sciences have been inundated by Big Data, such as DNA sequence data and electronic medical records.

"Developing Cloud-based tools for Big Neural Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Big data has the potential to dramatically advance the electrophysiology biodata sciences in similar ways that it has transformed Genetics. Differences between these two areas dictate separate approaches to apply Big Data tools, and methods in order to provide successful assets to the research community. For one, neural datasets are very heterogeneous by nature. The data is difficult to interpret without knowing specifics about the data acquisition protocol, the experimental paradigm and the physiological state of the recorded subject. Many neural datasets are complemented with complex meta-data sets, which should be an integral component in any effort to integrate and share these data with other researchers. The goal of this project is to develop novel, generalizable Big Data tools to facilitate cloud-base analysis of complex multi-scale neural data. Epilepsy research will be used as a specific use case to guide the development of the tools. A cohort of established senior investigators performing epilepsy research will use and validate these tools in their laboratories. Epilepsy research is currently limited by its narrow focus on single models (animal or human) in individual centers and laboratories. Just as Genetics was revolutionized through Big Data techniques, so too can Epilepsy research be transformed through novel approaches to standardize, share, and mine data across groups of investigators. Over the past several years I have co-developed a NINDS funded cloud-based data platform, ://ieeg.org, giving me a central role in developing Big Data solutions for neural data, such as customized data sharing, large-scale cloud-based data analysis, and search and interrogation techniques for complex data and metadata. My scientific objectives for this project are: (1) to develop generalizable tools to curate, analyze, and interrogate multi-scale neural data, and (2) to create a platform that will galvanize a research community focused on sharing data, and methods to advance Big Data research in the basic and translational neurosciences. Equally important to this proposal, I present a training plan to prepare me for an academic career focused on Big Data in the neurosciences. This plan supplements my background in bioengineering and statistical modeling of neural data with broader data-science expertise in data integration and machine learning, and deeper domain knowledge of the clinical neurosciences. I have assembled a group of collaborators, basic investigators and clinician scientists, who will use the tools developed in this project to analyze and validate their data and methods. I will use the results of this project as the foundation for a R01 Grant application, in which I will expand the developed platform and tools to target other research domains (TBI, Emergency Care, Cardiac), as well as integrate other data-modalities such as Imaging, and Genomics.

"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.            ",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8830000,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2014,151804,0.05343755256799493
"A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inception of the BD2K Initiative is a testament to the foresight of NIH and our community. Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data. Capitalizing on our investigators' complementary strengths in computational biology and cardiovascular medicine, we will present a fusion of cutting-edge innovations that are grounded in a cardiovascular research focus, encompassing: (i) on-the-cloud data processing, (ii) crowd sourcing and text-mining data annotation, (iii) protein spatiotemporal dynamics, (iv) multi-omic integration, and (v) multiscale clinical data modeling. Drawing from our decade of experience in creating and refining bioinformatics tools, we propose to amalgamate established Big Data resources into a generalizable model for data annotation and collaborative research, through a new query system and cloud infrastructure for accessing multiple omics repositories, and through computational-supported crowdsourcing initiatives for mining the biomedical literature. We propose to interweave diverse data types for revealing biological networks that coalesce from molecular entities at multiple scales, through machine learning methods for structuring molecular data and defining relationships with drugs and diseases, and through novel algorithms for on-the-cloud integration and pathway visualization of multi-dimensional molecular data. Moreover, we propose to innovate advanced modeling tools to resolve protein dynamics and spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms, through mechanistic modeling of protein properties and 3D protein expression maps, and through Bayesian algorithms that correlate patient phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles. The utility and customizability o our tools to the broader research population is clearly demonstrated using three archetypical workflows that enable annotations of large lists of genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites; powerful analysis of complex protein datasets acquired over time; and seamless aQoregation of diverse molecular, textual and literature data. These workflows will be rigorously validated using data from two significant clinical cohorts, the Jackson Heart Study and the Healthy Elderly Longevity (Wellderly). In parallel, a multifaceted strategy will be implemented to educate and train biomedical investigators, and to engage the public for promoting the overall BD2K initiative. We are convinced that a community-driven BD2K initiative will best realize its scientific potential and transform the research culture in a sustainable manner, exhibiting lasting success beyond the current funding period.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The challenges of biomedical Big Data are multifaceted. Biomedical investigators face daunting tasks of storing, analyzing, and distributing large-scale omics data, and aggregating all information to discern mechanistic insights. A coherent effort is required to harness disarrayed Big Data and transform them into intelligible scientific facts, whil engaging the global community via education and outreach programs.

"Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine     DESCRIPTION:  As the era of ""Big Data"" is dawning on biomedical research, multiple types of biomedical data, including phenotypic, molecular (including -omics), clinical, imaging, behavioral, and environmental data is being generated on an unprecedented scale with high volume, variety and velocity. These datasets are increasingly large and complex, challenging our current abilities for data representation, integration and analysis for improving outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. It is well-recognized that the greatest challenge to leveraging the significant potentials of Big Data is in educating and recruiting future computational and data scientists who have the background, training and experience to master fundamental opportunities in biomedical sciences. This demands interdisciplinary education and hands-on practicum training on understanding the application, analysis, limitations, and value of the Big Data. To bridge this knowledge gap for the U.S. biomedical workforce, we propose to develop a research educational program-Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine (BDC4CM)-that will instruct students, fellows and scientists in the use of specific new methods and tools fo Big Data by providing tailored, in-depth instruction, hands-on laboratory modules, and case studies on Big Data access, integration, processing and analysis. Offered by highly interdisciplinary and experienced faculty from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota, this program will provide a short- term training opportunity on Big Data methods and approaches for: 1) data and knowledge representation standards; 2) information extraction and natural language processing; 3) visualization analytics; 4) data mining and predictive modeling; 5) privacy and ethics; and 6) applications in comparative effectiveness research and population health research and improvement.

"Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Biomedical science, higher education, software and technology are simultaneously undergoing tectonic shifts. The amazing pace of software and technological development are driving equally amazing advances in the ability to acquire massive data sets in the biomedical sciences. These new Big Biomedical data sets come in the form of complex measurements, such as that of the brain, genome, proteome and human biome or massive databases, such as with electronic health records. Big Data issues, such as reproducibility of processing, measurement and analysis techniques, are increasingly complex, and crucial. Across all domains there is a knowledge gap of researchers to analyze and interpret these new data sets and the current higher education model cannot meet the insatiable demand for this training. We propose to make substantial progress on these issues in two domains. Specifically, we propose to use Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to create two series, one in neuroimaging and one in genomics. These series will allow for flexible, student paced, low cost scalable training for tens of thousands of students. Along with these series, we propose the creation of modular Big Data biostatistical content that can be used by students as well as teachers. This effort will be parallel to work on an intelligent tutoring syste called swirl. This application proposes to use swirl to create rich, gamified learning environments for students. All of the material created from this grant will be open access and free.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Project narrative: We propose two Massive Open Online Course series in neuroimaging and genomic Big Data analysis as well as the creation of modular Big Data statistics content and content creation for an intelligent tutoring system.            ","Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems",8829370,R25EB020378,"['Adopted', 'Amaze', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Models', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Nurses', 'Public Health Nursing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'cost', 'density', 'flexibility', 'instructor', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'process repeatability', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R25,2014,216000,0.11861398287054692
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility.

"The q-bio Summer School     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems.

"ISMB 2012 Conference Support for Students & Young Scientists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2012 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in will be held in Long Beach, California, with 1,500-1,700 attendees, including 33-38% students/post doctoral researchers. ISMB brings together graduate students, post doctoral researchers, faculty, research staff and senior scientists of many different nationalities, all of whom are studying or working in computer science, molecular biology, mathematics or statistics. The conference brings biologists and computational scientists together to focus on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on ""intelligent systems"" and actual biological data makes ISMB a highly relevant meeting, and many years of producing the event has resulted in a professionally organized and respected annual conference. The ISMB conference presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences, including advances in sequencing genomes that may lead to a better understanding of how, for instance, cells interact for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Presentations may describe methods and advances associated with the analysis of existing biological literature, including benchmarking experiments, to create a better public understanding of scientific research reports. Overall, ISMB serves to educate attendees on the latest developments that will further drive the research methods and results of the field of computational biology. Students and scientists are able to return to their labs to appy what they have learned as they advance their own research efforts or begin investigating new areas they were exposed to as a result of attending ISMB. The scientific program for each ISMB meeting includes parallel presentation tracks of original research papers, highlights of recently published papers, special sessions focused on emerging topics, technology demos, late breaking research and poster presentations, an art in science exhibition, tutorial workshops, special interest group meetings and a student symposium organized by and for students. For ISMB 2011, 258 original research papers were submitted and 48 selected for the Proceedings Track, while 88 previously published papers were submitted and 38 selected for the Highlights Track. In all, over 225 talks were presented during the course of the 2011 conference, and similar numbers are anticipated for 2012. In all cases, submissions are rigorously reviewed, typically by three members of each track's committee before approval by the track chair, insuring the highest possible quality of work is presented. The specific areas represented in the conference vary each year depending on the areas that researchers find most interesting and innovative, and therefore submit as papers and proposals. This proposal seeks funding to assist students and junior researchers in attending the conference, thus exposing them to the latest research of their own areas as well as areas that may be new to them.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems, largely driven by genomic sequence efforts due to the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it. The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference series directly addresses these questions by showcasing the latest advances in the field and exposing what's on the horizon of future discoveries, but is distinguished from many other events in computational biology or artificial intelligence by an insistence that the researchers work with real molecular biology data, not theoretical or toy examples. Although the cultures of computer science and biology are so disparate, ISMB bridges this cultural gap by providing a forum among biological conferences that features technical advances as they occur, which otherwise may be shunned until a firm experimental result is published.              Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems, largely driven by genomic sequence efforts due to the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it.

"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal focuses on the development of accessible artificial intelligence (AI) software for individualized tutoring and formative assessment in chemistry education. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the very first AI tutoring systems for chemistry that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. An AI tutoring methodology formulated with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. Furthermore, classroom teachers can obtain individualized assessment reporting and diagnostic information for visually impaired students on demand, as if from a ""virtual teaching assistant"". Feasibility of Phase I was demonstrated by developing a prototype accessible AI tutoring program that received certification in the National Federation of the Blind's (NFB) Nonvisual Accessibility Web Application Certification Program. In previous SBIR projects, Quantum has successfully innovated new concepts in the field of AI and has developed, tested and brought to the classroom tutoring and assessment systems for science and mathematics education. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with other print-related disabilities, using Internet- capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation is the development of the first advanced AI chemistry tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. Important Phase II objectives include:  Continued progress on chemistry-specific accessibility issues. Completion of full accessibility support in AI framework itself. Implementation of Braille support for chemical formulas and equations. Investigation of chemistry-specific pedagogical issues for blind students. Extension to accessible science assessment for blind/VI students, building on AI assessment technology currently under development by Quantum in other projects. Special education is a particular challenge for assessment within the No Child Left Behind legislation. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum has long-term partnerships with McGraw-Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as two additional commercial agreements with major science education supply companies, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories and Sargent-Welch. Chemistry comprises the majority of the content standard for physical science in the National Science Education Standards, and yet is one of the most neglected areas in terms of quality educational software, in general, and is a particularly acute problem for the blind and visually impaired. Through recent federally-supported research, Quantum Simulations, Inc. has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the very first artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring systems for chemistry. The goal of the present research is to bring the full power and benefit of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired using Internet-capable screen access technology.          n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR),7404392,R44EY016251,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Categories', 'Certification', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Purpose', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Special Education', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Students', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'blind', 'braille', 'commercialization', 'concept', 'design', 'disability', 'falls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'physical science', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'science education', 'simulation', 'success', 'teacher', 'technological innovation', 'virtual']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R44,2008,383858,0.04141720539293525

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7389728,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2008,373102,0.0912525439686457
"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal focuses on the development of accessible artificial intelligence (AI) software for individualized tutoring and formative assessment in chemistry education. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the very first AI tutoring systems for chemistry that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. An AI tutoring methodology formulated with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. Furthermore, classroom teachers can obtain individualized assessment reporting and diagnostic information for visually impaired students on demand, as if from a ""virtual teaching assistant"". Feasibility of Phase I was demonstrated by developing a prototype accessible AI tutoring program that received certification in the National Federation of the Blind's (NFB) Nonvisual Accessibility Web Application Certification Program. In previous SBIR projects, Quantum has successfully innovated new concepts in the field of AI and has developed, tested and brought to the classroom tutoring and assessment systems for science and mathematics education. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with other print-related disabilities, using Internet- capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation is the development of the first advanced AI chemistry tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. Important Phase II objectives include:  Continued progress on chemistry-specific accessibility issues. Completion of full accessibility support in AI framework itself. Implementation of Braille support for chemical formulas and equations. Investigation of chemistry-specific pedagogical issues for blind students. Extension to accessible science assessment for blind/VI students, building on AI assessment technology currently under development by Quantum in other projects. Special education is a particular challenge for assessment within the No Child Left Behind legislation. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum has long-term partnerships with McGraw-Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as two additional commercial agreements with major science education supply companies, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories and Sargent-Welch.

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7209749,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2007,430160,0.0912525439686457
"REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a summer program for undergraduates with non-biological sciences backgrounds that will provide cross-discipline training and experiences in combining the physical sciences backgrounds of the participants with concepts and approaches of functional genomics and cell biology to address biomedical research problems. The intended impact of our program is to encourage participating students to pursue graduate education in biomedical sciences, followed by careers in biomedical research.       Six students will be selected each year to pursue 10-week research experiences in one of eleven laboratories at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Instruction in functional genomics and cell biology will be provided through workshops and a series of seminars. Students will work as a group on a cross-discipline case study in wound-healing. In addition, students will receive instruction in research ethics, scientific writing, and career opportunities in biomedical sciences. At the conclusion of the summer, students will present their work at a poster session and receive evaluations. Students will be encouraged to publish their results in the Journal of the Ohio Association of Science.  To build community among these students, they will participate in a series of social and cultural events.   Formative evaluations will be used to alter and fine-tune the Program, and summative evaluations will be carried out at the conclusion of each summer and again, as the participants graduate from their undergraduate institutions, to measure the long-term impact of the Program on the participating students. n/a",REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology,7226706,R25GM072834,"['Academia', 'Academy',

"Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Precollege science education, particularly middle school where students first encounter courses dedicated to the sciences, has lacked the attention of the scientific and education communities. As a result, many middle level teachers are marginally prepared to teach contemporary science, the development of effective curricular materials has lagged, and schools devote inadequate resources and support to science. In the prior Phase I grant, experiment modules have been designed by scientists that address the core content of middle school Life Science. They utilize live (aquatic) organisms in the class room to stimulate inquiry into the properties of living organisms and make connections with related environmental health problems to link student learning with the world around them. Human environmental health was chosen as the biomedical context because it strongly relates to the macroscopic world in which middle school students live and provides age-appropriate learning opportunities for students as they begin to understand organisms and their underlying structures and mechanisms. During Phase II our specific objectives are 1. To infuse middle school Life Science education with attractive experiment modules that stress student inquiry. 2. To mount a comprehensive dissemination program with school systems that work with large numbers of minorities and students from families with lower socioeconomic status. 3. To utilize a 'train the trainer' method for lead teachers to achieve wide dissemination of the modules that involves close collaboration between scientists and educators and the lead teachers. 4. To provide teachers with full support to implement and sustain the modules through a science resource center. 5. To continue the development of the content of the modules. 6. To obtain a thorough formative and summative evaluation of the effectiveness of the curriculum modules and the entire mechanism for their delivery. 7. To establish a robust program to sustain the module dissemination to teachers after the completion of the grant.         n/a",Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII,6857683,R25RR014267,"['DVD /CD ROM', 'artificial intelligence', 'curriculum', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'ethnic group', 'female', 'learning', 'meeting /conference /symposium', 'minority health professional', 'science education', 'secondary schools', 'social support network', 'teacher', 'university student', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R25,2005,268813,0.06815411010127274
"LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stottler Henke Associates in collaboration with Teachers College, Columbia University, proposes to build a software system for teaching scientific inquiry in the context of nutrition science, The goal of the proposed research is to develop a computer based instructional system - called LiFESim - that teaches accurate and detailed information about food and the food system -- from production of food on the farm through food processing and transportation, to impacts of food on personal health and on the natural environment in terms of waste and pollution. The software will complement an existing health science curriculum, developed at Teachers College for 4th-6th graders, called ""Linking Food and the Environment"" or LIFE, developed from an NIH Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) RR 12374 (1997-2004). Our system will be based on the paradigm of role-playing simulation used in such popular computer games as SimCity and The Sims: students using the software assume roles in a simulated environment and learn from the consequences of the decisions that they make in those roles. Using the simulation paradigm students will be able to explore the dynamics of large-scale systems, such as those the food transportation system in ways that are not possible with the existing curriculum. For example, the simulation would allow students to explore the impact of changes in transportation patterns on food delivery. Our system will provide explicit coaching in applying scientific methods for investigation. We will also explore learning strategies that will encourage students to critically examine - and hopefully improve - their dietary choices. We will complement simulation-based learning with two other artificial intelligence based methodologies - the use of lifelike pedagogical agents, and the use of case-based reasoning. During Phase I, we will develop a set of detailed instructional goals, use these to develop an initial system design, develop a limited prototype of the system, and then develop and perform an informal pilot study to evaluate the viability of our design. The pilot study will be conducted over a one-month period at schools in Hayward, California and New York City. Our Phase II effort will focus on developing an extensive design and performing detailed use testing of the system developed during Phase I.         n/a",LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR),6790401,R43RR019780,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'environmental contamination', 'food', 'food processing /preparation', 'health education', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrition', 'nutrition related tag', 'science education']",NCRR,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2004,100000,0.028766282587658752
"AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR proposal is aimed at advancing the state of the art in chemistry education software in a critically important respect demanded by students, teachers, administrators and Quantum Simulations, Inc. customers. The focus of this innovation is the development of meaningful interactive tutoring and assessment capabilities for chemistry problem solving. Empowerment of students to make the proper decisions about drugs through experiencing the scientific process requires a solid education in basic chemistry. Chemical formulas comprise much of the fundamental ""language"" of chemistry in which students must be fluent in order to succeed. The topic of writing and understanding chemical formulas, a cornerstone of all general chemistry classes, is a reasonable starting point for the development of an AI assessment system for student learning in chemistry. A solid understanding of chemical formulas is a prerequisite to success in chemistry required not only for literacy to make informed decisions about drugs from a scientific standpoint, but also to enable and prepare students to pursue careers in research related to drug abuse. Quantum has already successfully developed and commercialized an ITS for writing chemical formulas which will be used as the starting point for the present work. The proposed technology will benefit all students; however, it is specifically targeted to help those who have the greatest need, such as students of average or marginal performance and students from historically underserved groups, by lowering barriers to accessing high-quality science instructional software.  Quantum customers include textbook publishers, software providers, hardware vendors and distance learning companies. A prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, has entered into two long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. Quantum intends to employ an identical business model to commercialize the results of this project. n/a",AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse,6831228,R43DA018455,"['adolescence (12-20)', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug abuse education', 'educational resource design /development', 'human subject', 'science education']",NIDA,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2004,61750,0.039390766562906375

"Educational Tools for Neuroscience   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SHAI proposes to bring two instructional        technologies together to compliment neuroscience lectures and distance               learning. Specifically we want to embed Computer Simulations of experiments and      the chemical, genetic, and physiological systems that underlie them within an        Intelligent Tutoring System. Simulations are excellent tools for revealing the       structure and dynamics of systems to students. They can also serve as a basis        of interactive experiments where students can ""discover"" the answers to              questions. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are an emerging educational            technology based on artificial intelligence research. They play the role of          tutor, in that they guide students with appropriate information or                   demonstrations when they are having difficulty with a lesson. They also              adaptively plan the presentation of new lessons based on evaluations of a            student's past performance and knowledge level. The objective of this phase I        proposal is to develop a prototype of NeuroTutor, a simulation-based ITS to          provide students with individualized instruction in a simulation centered            environment. Steps to reaching this objective include designing a curriculum,        developing instructional, presentations and support, developing appropriate          methods for Student Modeling and Diagnosis, and implementing a limited               prototype.

"A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring Glaucoma is a complex neurodegenerative disease that results in degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. With older people making up the fastest growing part of the US population, glaucoma will become even more prevalent in the US in the coming decades. Due to the complex interaction of multiple factors in glaucoma, better structural and functional predictors are needed for its progression. The main impediments are massive health record data and sophisticated computational models. Our overall goal is to leverage the power of big data and rapidly evolving machine learning approaches. The NEI's “Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)” initiative and the American Academy of Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) registry are all efforts to exploit the power of data and to better understand diseases and to provide improved prevention and treatment.  In this multi-PI proposal, we offer to assemble over 1 million optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual fields (VFs) from the glaucoma research network (GRN). We propose to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that synthesizes Gaussian mixture model expectation maximization (GEM) and archetypal machine learning approach to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring using VFs and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements. We will make these tools openly available to the vision and ophthalmology research communities.  Our proposed studies could offer substantial improvements in the prognosis of glaucoma as well as potentially providing OCT and joint VF/OCT surrogate endpoints to be used in glaucoma clinical trials. Leveraging big data in eye care is challenging. This study uses big functional and structural glaucoma data and develops hybrid machine learning models to identify glaucoma progression and its monitoring. Results could offer substantial improvements in prognosis of glaucoma and may provide surrogate endpoints for use in glaucoma clinical trials.",A hybrid artificial intelligence framework for glaucoma monitoring,9892013,R21EY030142,"['Academy', 'Address', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axon', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Gaussian model', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'analytical method', 'archetypal analysis', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data space', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'field study', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'retinal ganglion cell degeneration', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,220808,0.056430069445448025
"Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Abstract Andrew Holbrook, Ph.D., is a Bayesian statistician with a broad background in applied, theoretical and compu- tational data science. His proposed research Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning tackles viral outbreak forecasting by combining Bayesian phylogenetic modeling with ﬂexible, `self-exciting' stochastic process models. The development and publication of open-source, high-performance computing software for his models will facilitate fast epidemiological ﬁeld response in a big data setting. Dr. Holbrook will apply his method- ology to the reconstruction of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic in the Americas, focusing on identifying key geographical routes of transmission and phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.  Candidate: Dr. Holbrook is Postdoctoral Scholar at the UCLA Department of Human Genetics. He earned his Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine, during which time he completed his dissertation Geometric Bayes, an investigation into Bayesian modeling and computing on abstract mathematical spaces, and simultaneously participated in scientiﬁc collaborations at the UC Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The proposed career development plan will establish Dr. Holbrook as an independent leader in data intensive viral epidemiology by 1) facilitating coursework to build biological domain knowledge, 2) affording Dr. Holbrook the opportunity to lead his own project while remaining under the expert oversight of UCLA Prof. Marc Suchard, M.D., Ph.D., and 3) allowing Dr. Holbrook to continue his focus on quantitative viral epidemiology once he has moved to a faculty commitment.  Mentors: During the ﬁrst three years of the award period, Dr. Holbrook will work closely with Prof. Suchard, continuing their current schedule of weekly meetings. Prof. Suchard is a leading expert in both Bayesian phylo- genetics and high-performance statistical computing; and with his medical background, Prof. Suchard will advise Dr. Holbrook in his expansion of domain knowledge in viral epidemiology. As secondary mentor, Prof. Kristian Andersen, Ph.D., of the Scripps Institute will advise Dr. Holbrook in the impactful application of his statistical and computational methodologies to the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic. Dr. Holbrook and Profs. Suchard and Andersen will maintain their collaborations after the postdoctoral period.  Research: Bayesian phylogenetics successfully reconstructs evolutionary histories but fails to predict viral spread. Self-exciting point processes are devoid of biological insight and fail to account for geographic networks of diffusion. Aim 1 addresses deﬁciencies in these two complementary viral epidemiological modeling techniques by innovating a combined model where the phylogenetic and self-excitatory components support each other. Aim 2 makes widespread adoption a reality by publishing open-source, massively parallel computing software suitable for big data analysis. Aim 3 reconstructs the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic, learns key geographical routes of transmission and identiﬁes phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness. Project Narrative Tracking and predicting viral outbreaks remains an open epidemiological problem with deadly consequences. Dr. Holbrook will attack the problem with his Bayesian phylogenetic Hawkes processes, a class of models tailored to simultaneously reconstruct evolutionary histories and predict viral diffusion dynamics. With the mentorship of Profs. Marc Suchard (primary) and Kristian Andersen (secondary), Dr. Holbrook will develop open-source, high-performance computing software and apply his statistical computing methodology to the analysis of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic of the Americas, learning key routes of transmission and identifying phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.",Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning,10039150,K25AI153816,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Air', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Americas', 'Award', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Herd Immunity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Ships', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Viral', 'Viral Epidemiology', 'Viral Physiology', 'Work', 'ZIKA', 'Zika Virus', 'blind', 'career development', 'epidemiological model', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel computer', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'statistics', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K25,2020,106467,0.04024038582120241
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,10002209,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Facebook', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2020,100690,0.060844257098268933
"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,9923688,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,276700,0.04070155805429426
"ORS-ISFR 17th Biennial Conference: Thinking big on fracture repair Abstract Bone fractures occur in more than 25 million Americans per year, and a significant percentage of those fractures fail to heal. Fractures that show delayed or failed progression to heal account for the majority of patient disability and costs. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the biology of bone healing, and to use that knowledge to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics. We are seeking support for the 17th Biennial conference of the International Section of Fracture Repair (ISFR). The ISFR recently became incorporated as a section within the Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) thereby leveraging the outreach of the largest scientific organization in the world dedicated to orthopaedic research. The ISFR is dedicated to the advancement and exchange of the most current scientific ideas and research findings on fracture repair and its application to the improvement of patient care. Our mission is be the premier forum to integrate and present cutting-edge ideas related to clinical, translational, and basic science research of fracture healing. The central theme for this conference is “Thinking Big”. We will present the use of -omics approaches to solve the most significant research problems in the field and large-scale data management and advanced computational approaches to solve intractable clinical concerns. The meeting is organized around seven scientific sessions, and also includes an embedded symposium conducted with the Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) focused on non-unions and a collaborative session on proximal humeral fractures conducted with the Bone and Joint Institute of the University of Western Ontario (BJI). The scientific sessions will each have a series of speakers, selected from submitted abstracts, and each will have an eminent keynote invited speaker. The sessions include: Stem Cells in Fracture; Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big data; Fracture induced pain management; Fracture repair basic research; Fracture repair clinical perspectives; Bone repair with polytrauma; and Outcomes. There will also be a short session for poster oral presentations (poster teasers), a session on how to communicate science, a practicum on data management, and an ORS Presidential Guest Speaker. Following the ISFR 17th biennial conference there will be an associated ISFR/BJI consensus workshop, which will develop a consensus white-paper on the best evidence-based treatment for proximal humeral fractures. The meeting will present the most up to date research on fracture healing basic biology, translational research and prospective clinical studies. The Program and Scientific Committees will be highly focused on fostering an inclusive environment. Surgeons, biologists, engineers, and policy makers will attend the meeting, and be drawn from academia, government, and industry. A variety of activities will be focused on career development and networking for trainees in the bone healing field. Narrative The 17th Biennial Conference of the ORS/ISFR titled, “Thinking big on fracture repair” will be held in December of 2020. The goal of the event is to foster growth and innovation in the field of fracture-induced pain management, artificial learning/machine learning/smart technology, polytrauma and stem cells, and outcomes research. Scientists, industry partners, researchers, policy makers, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students will attend the meeting to discuss the most pressing questions in the field of fracture repair, and to consider bold approaches to solving those problems.",ORS-ISFR 17th Biennial Conference: Thinking big on fracture repair,10066004,R13AR077963,"['Academia', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Bone Injury', 'Bone Pain', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Canada', 'Career Mobility', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Workshop', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Fracture', 'Fracture Healing', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mission', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Ontario', 'Oral', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain management', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Policy Maker', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shoulder Fractures', 'Societies', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'bone healing', 'career development', 'career networking', 'cost', 'data management', 'disability', 'graduate student', 'healing', 'humerus', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'meetings', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'population based', 'posters', 'programs', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'scientific organization', 'stem cells', 'success', 'symposium', 'translational physician']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R13,2020,5000,0.011570346079275215
"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

"Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The Arkansas Research Alliance proposes to hold five annual workshops on the subject of bioinformatics. The purpose is to bring six major Arkansas institutions into closer collaboration. Those institutions are: University of Arkansas-Fayetteville; Arkansas State University; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas at Little Rock; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Center for Toxicological Research. The workshops will focus on capabilities at each of the six in sciences related to bioinformatics including artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, food and agriculture, high speed computing, and visualization capabilities. As this work progresses, educational coordination and student encouragement will be important components. Principals from all six institutions are collaborating to accomplish the workshop goals. Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,9961522,R13FD006690,[' '],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2020,15000,0.030937601752045095
"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,9892671,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,183209,0.042173067581688206
"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio)statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field of health big data. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offers and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will primarily draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from three different departments within three different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science, Medicine, Population Health, Social and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including statistical modeling, data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high- dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and medical imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and success with the current summer program on Big Data led by this team with 164 students trained in the last 4 years (2015-2018) including 90 female students and 30 students from underrepresented minority groups. Fourteen of these participants from the last three years are currently graduate students in Michigan Biostatistics. The ongoing program has gained traction in the national landscape of summer research programs with 20% rate of admission and 80% rate of acceptance among those who are offered this opportunity. The program has consistently received very strong evaluation and our past alumni have become brand ambassadors and advocates for our program. We plan to build on the success and legacy of this program in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2019-2021). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a non-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 45 undergraduates nationally and internationally, with 20 domestic students supported by the requested SIBS funding mechanism and others supported by supplementary institutional and foundation support. We propose to expose the trainees to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of health Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. They will engage in mentored research projects in three primary areas of health big data: Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. Some of the projects will be defined in the area of cardiovascular precision medicine, defined by a team of highly quantitative researchers engaged in cardiovascular research that uses big data. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by U-M researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. We propose an inter-SIBS collaboration with Dordt College summer program trainees who will attend this concluding symposium. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world. We will offer multiple professional development opportunities and resources for graduate school preparation to our trainees so that they can reflect and plan beyond their senior year. All of our proposed activities are reflected through our three specific aims: Teaching, Mentoring and Dissemination. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a six week long undergraduate summer institute: “Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data” to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 45 undergraduate students recruited nationally and internationally, from 2019-2021. Funding is requested for 20 domestic students with supplementary funding expected to be garnered through institutional resources and private foundation support. The program builds on the success of our existing Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI) supported by a NIH BD2K Courses and Skills grant award that is ending in 2018. We plan to expose program students to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data and Human Health. We enhance our ongoing summer program structure in the current proposal by involving a team of researchers working at the intersection of cardiovascular research and data science with a focus on cardiovascular precision medicine where some of the new mentored research projects will be defined. We primarily focus on three genres of health Big Data arising in Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. The trainees will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty from Biostatistics, Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences, Epidemiology and Medicine, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation.

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,10004013,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2020,239423,0.07279790108536786
"Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design Project Summary/Abstract The next generation of bioengineering and biomedical researchers will have unprecedented access to technologies including wireless health, big data, genetic sequencing, and machine learning approaches to enable modern diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. This presents individuals trained at the interface of technology and biomedicine with an enormous opportunity to address the world’s needs in health and medicine. In the Bioengineering Department at the University of California, Los Angeles, we aim to develop students into leaders able to seamlessly identify clinical needs that technology can address, design and validate solutions that address these needs, communicate with a variety of stakeholders to build teams invested in problem-oriented solutions, and to navigate the regulatory and commercial pathways necessary to enable their technologies to thrive. The Bioengineering Capstone Series at UCLA leverages resources available at UCLA to enable students to: 1) gain insight into clinical needs directly from clinicians and educators across the Ronald Reagan Medical Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, School of Dentistry and UCLA Health System, 2) design their solutions through mentorship from engineering professors, 3) understand the complexities of the biomedical industry with support from the UCLA Technology Development Group and members of the Department of Engineering Industry Advisory Board, 4) utilize modern technologies in wireless health and data science by collaborating with the Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data- to-Knowledge (MD2K) and Mobile Health (mHealth) Institute at UCLA, and 5) work with the National Science Foundation Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations Engineering Research Center (NSF PATHS- UP ERC) to learn to target and communicate their technologies to maximize societal benefits. Statement of Public Health Relevance: To prepare the next generation of engineers with skills in the design of therapeutics and medical devices, this research education program will provide bioengineering students at UCLA with enhanced opportunities to engage in real world design for biomedical applications. We will guide students through the medical design process from identifying needs, creating solutions which address these needs, and communicating the significance of their contributions to the greater community, ultimately yielding a larger pool of well-trained engineers to address biomedical challenges. !",Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design,9951056,R25EB027626,"['Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Technology', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High School Student', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intellectual Property', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modernization', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'STEM field', 'School Dentistry', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education research', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'lectures', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'product development', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'skills', 'technology development', 'undergraduate student']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R25,2020,21600,0.044155465824172804
"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9889974,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2020,575531,0.08574599192210977
"Statistical Methods for Ultrahigh-dimensional Biomedical Data This proposal develops novel statistics and machine learning methods for distributed analysis of big data in biomedical studies and precision medicine and for selecting a small group of molecules that are associated with biological and clinical outcomes from high-throughput data such as microarray, proteomic, and next generation sequence from biomedical research, especially for autism studies and Alzheimer’s disease research. It focuses on developing efficient distributed statistical methods for Big Data computing, storage, and communication, and for solving distributed health data collected at different locations that are hard to aggregate in meta-analysis due to privacy and ownership concerns. It develops both computationally and statistically efficient methods and valid statistical tools for exploring heterogeneity of big data in precision medicine, for studying associations of genomics and genetic information with clinical and biological outcomes, and for feature selection and model building in presence of errors-in- variables, endogeneity, and heavy-tail error distributions, and for predicting clinical outcomes and understanding molecular mechanisms. It introduces more robust and powerful statistical tests for selection of significant genes, SNPs, and proteins in presence of dependence of data, valid control of false discovery rate for dependent test statistics, and evaluation of treatment effects on a group of molecules. The strength and weakness of each proposed method will be critically analyzed via theoretical investigations and simulation studies. Related software will be developed for free dissemination. Data sets from ongoing autism research, Alzheimer’s disease, and other biomedical studies will be analyzed by using the newly developed methods and the results will be further biologically confirmed and investigated. The research findings will have strong impact on statistical analysis of high throughput big data for biomedical research and on understanding heterogeneity for precision medicine and molecular mechanisms of autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases.

"Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of newly emerging computational tools for data science, biostatisticians need to play a fundamental role in health sciences research. There is an urgent need to encourage US Citizens and Permanent Residents to pursue graduate training in biostatistics. The design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials and observational studies; the setting of regulatory policy; and the conception of laboratory experiments have been shaped by the fundamental contributions of biostatisticians for decades. Advances in genomics, medical imaging technologies, and computational biology; the increasing emphasis on precision and evidence-based medicine; and the widespread adoption of electronic health records; demand the skills of biostatisticians trained to collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary environment and to develop statistical and machine learning methods to address the challenges presented by this data-rich revolutionary era of health sciences research. The proposed summer program which includes world-renowned clinical scientists and biostatisticians from two local universities, will provide an immense opportunity for student participants to learn basic yet modern statistical methods that are critical to uncovering new insights from such big and complex biomedical data and also illustrate the potential pitfalls of confounding and bias that may arise when analyzing biomedical data. A unique feature of the proposed training program is thus to expose the participants to not only basic statistical methods but also to the topics of computer science and bioinformatics which will be invaluable in creating the multidisciplinary teams required to tackle the complex research questions that often requires multipronged approaches. The proposed six-week training program will be structured around the NIH's Translation Science Spectrum and will introduce participants to opportunities in biostatistics through the lens of the science advanced by the contributions of biostatisticians. Following an initial set of weeks on basic training of biostatistical methods, the program will culminate in a data hack-a-thon style competition in which participants will employ the statistical and scientific knowledge gained during the program to produce the most innovative, statistically-sound, scientifically-relevant and effectively-communicated response to a set of research questions. The proposed research education program will enroll up to 20 such participants from across the nation and, through lectures, field trips, and opportunities to analyze data from real health sciences, inspire them to pursue graduate training. The program will draw upon considerable past collaborations and complementary resources of two local world-renowned universities to provide participants with an unparalleled view of the field, including award-winning instructors, internationally known methodological and clinical researchers, and a local area rich in opportunities to showcase careers in biostatistics. Special efforts will be made to enroll participants from underrepresented groups. Participants will be followed after completion, and the numbers attending graduate school in statistics and pursuing biostatistics careers will be documented. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biostatisticians are indispensible contributors to health sciences research. The demand for professionals with advanced training in biostatistics is high and will continue to increase, especially with the expanding challenges posed by big biomedical data. This six week summer research education program, a joint effort of North Carolina State University and Duke University, will enroll up to 20 US citizen/permanent resident participants from across the nation in the summers of 2020-2022 and expose them to the opportunities presented by careers in biostatistics and encourage them to seek graduate training in the field.",Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences,9888421,R25HL147228,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Imaging technology', 'Institution', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Names', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Talents', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'education research', 'experience', 'field trip', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'investigator training', 'laboratory experiment', 'lectures', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health research', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'summer institute', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2020,249789,0.0514723301126115
"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization.

"Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud PROJECT SUMMARY Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of big data. Public cloud vendors provide computing as-a-utility enabling users to pay only for the resources that are actually used. In this application, we will develop methods and tools to enable biomedical researchers to optimize the costs of cloud computing when analyzing biomedical big data. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud provides computing as a utility, on-demand, to end users, enabling cloud resources to be rapidly provisioned and scaled to meet computational and performance requirements. In addition, dynamic intelligent allocation of cloud computing resources has great potential to both improve performance and reduce hosting costs. Unfortunately, determining the most cost-effective and efficient ways to deploy modules on the cloud is non- trivial, due to a plethora of cloud vendors, each providing different types of virtual machines with different capabilities, performance trade-offs, and pricing structures. In addition, modern bioinformatics workflows consist of multiple modules, applications and libraries, each with their own set of software dependencies. Software containers package binary executables and scripts into modules with their software dependencies. With containers that compartmentalize software dependencies, modules implemented as containers can be mixed and matched to create workflows that give identical results on any platform. The high degree of reproducibility and flexibility of software containers makes them ideal instruments for disseminating complex bioinformatics workflows. Our overarching goal is to deliver the latest technological advances in containers and cloud computing to a typical biomedical researcher with limited resources who works with big data. Specifically, we will develop a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface to enable biomedical researchers to build and edit containerized workflows. Most importantly, users can choose to deploy and scale selected modules in the workflow on cloud computing platforms in a transparent, yet guided fashion, to optimize cost and performance. Our aim is to provide a federated approach that leverages resources from multiple cloud vendors. We have assembled a team of interdisciplinary scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, cloud and distributed computing, and machine learning. As part of this application, we will work closely with end users who routinely generate and analyze RNA-seq data. We will illustrate how our containerized, cloud-enabled methods and tools will benefit bioinformatics analyses. Project Narrative Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenge of analyzing diverse and massive data generated to advance our understanding of health and diseases. We will develop methods and tools to build and intelligently deploy modular and cloud-enabled bioinformatics workflows. These tools will allow the biomedical community to optimize the costs associated with cloud computing and to facilitate the replication of scientific results.",Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud,9856493,R01GM126019,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drops', 'Drug toxicity', 'Educational Materials', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'RNA analysis', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomedical scientist', 'cloud platform', 'cluster computing', 'computational platform', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'distributed data', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'virtual machine', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,339098,0.03254644669574662
"IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020 Project Summary This R13 application will provide travel support for competitively selected U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty to present their work at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020 to be held April 4-8, 2020 at the Coralville Marriott Hotel & Conference Center near the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa. ISBI is a scientific conference dedicated to mathematical, algorithmic, and computational aspects of biological and biomedical imaging, across all scales of observation (from microscopic to whole-body imaging) and is sponsored by both the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) and the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS). It attracts approximately 600-700 attendees each year involved in biomedical imaging research and development from academic institutions, government laboratories, and private companies. Since its inception in 2002, ISBI has become a leading international conference bringing together researchers from diverse algorithmic fields, applications, modalities, and size scales, to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of four-page papers which are peer-reviewed much like journal articles. In addition to oral and poster presentations of peer-reviewed papers in multiple tracks during the main conference, ISBI 2020 will also include special student events, tutorials, a “clinical day” emphasizing multi-disciplinary presentations/collaborations, plenary talks, workshops, and onsite grand challenges. Recipients of the travel awards will be competitively selected based on need and scientific excellence. U.S.- based students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty with accepted papers will be eligible to apply. We will be particularly supportive in providing travel awards to women and under-represented groups to help increase the diversity of the attendees. We anticipate that the travel awards will provide sufficient funding to the awardees to make the cost-benefit ratio for attendance extremely favorable. Through their attendance at ISBI, the awardees will benefit through their exposure to the simultaneous breadth and depth of topics offered at ISBI (presented by a mixture of leaders in the field as well as those early in their careers), their experience of presenting their work at an international conference, and their interactions and discussions with other attendees and leaders in the field. The conference as a whole will also benefit by not only enabling the high-quality work of the attendees to be presented but by also enabling an increased attendance of (and discussions/ideas/interactions with) U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty with diverse backgrounds. Project Narrative This application requests funds to provide travel support for students, postdoctoral fellows, and/or early- career faculty to attend and participate in the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020 conference, to be held at the Coralville Marriott Hotel & Conference Center near the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, April 4-8, 2020.

"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,10003037,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories', 'violence exposure']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2020,137660,0.0823791260775518
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10092402,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2020,830874,0.029803447499970295
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10006915,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,231500,0.09594730417662448

"Pipelines into Quantitative Aging Research Project Summary It is well documented that a diverse workforce has the potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities, which have strong effects in aging populations1-3. As the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. population increases, including among the aged population, the public health workforce should reflect this diversity1,4,5. With an increase in undergraduate public health majors across the country6,7, due in part to heightened excitement and opportunities in data science and quantitative big data analysis, and with breakthroughs in the science of aging on the horizon, this is an opportune moment to develop strong pipeline programs for underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates. We will target URM undergraduates who have quantitative and computational interests and expose them to opportunities for graduate study and research careers, and the possibilities and excitement of marrying their quantitative interests with substantive research in aging. Introducing undergraduates, who are more diverse in public health majors than other majors7, and than graduate students6, to careers in public health, holds much promise for increasing the diversity of graduate students and faculty in the field, which has increased very little in the past 20 years6. This holds for the MSTEM subfields of public health, such as Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Data Science, as well. Motivated by these factors, and in response to NIA Funding Opportunity (PAR-17-290), “MSTEM: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research through Undergraduate Education (R25),” we propose an intensive, six-week summer program for 12 undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds with interests in Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Data Science and other quantitative methods to learn about the applications of these methods in aging research. The summer program includes formal instruction, a broad lecture series, mentored research projects, oral research presentation at an annual symposium, career and professional development sessions, site visits to labs and other research settings, group and informal mentoring, social activities and network building, and training in responsible conduct of research. To reinforce the intensive summer experience, we will continue to offer group and individual mentoring and research experiences into the following academic years. Additionally, we will offer a select group of summer program participants the opportunity to return to NYU during the January term for an extended research experience and a quantitative course. With the guidance of a professional evaluator and internal and external advisory committees, we will evaluate all aspects of our program and review results in real-time to enable constant adjustment and improvement. Our proposal addresses three critical needs to strengthen and galvanize the research enterprise in the field of aging: increased engagement of MSTEM experts, increased engagement of URM researchers, and increased attention to disparities. We believe that our intensive and long-term programmatic components will support the entry of talented URM students into successful careers in MSTEM research in aging. Project Narrative The goal of this R25 program is to increase the participation of underrepresented minority groups in the fields of Biostatistics and quantitative Public Health, with a collaborative focus on the diseases and processes of aging. The program includes an intensive six-week summer program for 12 students, with formal and informal instruction, mentored research, and extensive professional development activities, with a culminating symposium. For lasting impact, follow-up mentoring, continuing research and professional development will occur on a regular basis, both via webcast platforms and return, in-person visits.",Pipelines into Quantitative Aging Research,10024768,R25AG067931,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Attention', 'Autopsy', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Career Choice', 'Community Networks', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Diverse Workforce', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding Opportunities', 'GRE Preparation', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Program Reviews', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Series', 'Site Visit', 'Statistical Computing', 'Students', 'Talents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Visit', 'aging population', 'biomarker selection', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'faculty mentor', 'follow-up', 'graduate student', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'minority undergraduate', 'posters', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'student mentoring', 'summer program', 'symposium', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R25,2020,367149,0.0310699470573838
"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),10092617,UH3NS106899,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Drug Targeting', 'FAIR principles', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic CNS injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'bench to bedside', 'biobehavior', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'diverse data', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'heterogenous data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'productivity loss', 'repository', 'response to injury', 'spinal cord and brain injury', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH3,2020,323000,0.026225105271766292
"A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias BCR-ABL1 positive leukemias account for a substantial portion of adult leukemia. Tyrosine kinase  inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically changed survival outlook. However, current protocols recommend  patients receive TKI chemotherapy agents indefinitely, causing long-term toxicity and substantive  quality of life deficits, leading to decreased TKI compliance. Moreover, >50% of patients who stop  TKIs ultimately relapse and are not as responsive to post-relapse treatment; additionally, mutation  resistance is becoming an increasing issue with TKIs as patients live longer. It is hypothesized  patient heterogeneity within BCR-ABL1 leukemias are a major driving factor on outcome and strongly  influences optimal TKI selection and cessation. However, small cohort size and disease rarity has  impacted large, pragmatic clinical trials, necessitating a big data approach. The overall goal is  to quilt together individual studies to produce a comprehensive view of BCR-ABL1 leukemias that  includes epidemiology, etiology, assessment, and therapy, as well their inter-relationships. With  a comprehensive view, personalized, predictive medicine becomes possible. This project utilizes  literature mining and “big data” techniques to analyze four major categories: epidemiology (who  gets BCR-ABL1 leukemias, how response correlates to patient characteristics, etc.); etiology (what  factors trigger mutation, mechanisms to improve TKI specificity, preclinical model metrics,  prognostic indicators of recurrence/relapse, etc.); assessment (identifying new  diagnostic/prognostic metrics, improving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols, objective  staging criteria); and treatment (aggregate effect sizes among different therapies, short and  long-term side effect profiles, TKI selection protocols, adjunctive and combination therapies,  criteria for TKI cessation, etc.). The specific aims of the project include: 1) prototype a data  path and construct infrastructure for BCR-ABL1 data curation from literature and/or clinical  sources; 2) construct literature ontological field map to quantify topic depth, aggregate data, and  identify relationships within and between categories; 3) perform exploratory analysis to assess  aggregate statistical power and prototype predictive models for TKI optimization. In summary, the  present project delivers a 21st century, big data approach for BCR-ABL1 leukemia to optimize  clinical management and expedite basic preclinical research. This project is highly relevant to public health as it enables a comprehensive view of BCR ABL  positive leukemia(s) that can optimize clinical management and expedite preclinical research.",A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias,9869875,R21CA232249,"['ABL1 gene', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dimensions', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sample Size', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'Universities', 'Wheelchairs', 'adult leukemia', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'compliance behavior', 'data curation', 'data mining', 'database schema', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'drug intolerance', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'lexical', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'rare cancer', 'relational database', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'side effect', 'text searching', 'treatment duration']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,190454,0.05086039626842844
