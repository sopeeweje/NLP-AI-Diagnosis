"POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION,9753261,R01GM117241,"['Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anopheles Genus', 'Anopheles gambiae', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Catalogs', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mosquito-borne infectious disease', 'Mutation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'deep neural network', 'fight against', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'malaria infection', 'malaria mosquito', 'malaria transmission', 'markov model', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'resistance allele', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector mosquito']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2019,295000,-0.0333496708546078
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,9610628,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immunology procedure', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Infrastructure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Ships', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,224899,0.009267626061281179
"Inferring selection from human population genomic data Project Summary/Abstract Identifying genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation is a major challenge in population genetics. Particularly in humans, the task of confidently detecting the action of recent adaptive natural selection (or positive selection) has proved troublesome. Indeed there is considerable controversy over whether recent positive selection has a substantial impact on human genetic variation. The work proposed here will address this problem by creating a more complete map of positive selection across many human populations, identifying selection on de novo mutations as well as selection on previously standing variation.  Specifically, the proposed research seeks to construct a scan for positives election that is more robust and accurate than any currently existing methods (Aim 1). This tool will utilize supervised machine learning techniques allowing it combine information from a number of existing tests for natural selection, and will be tested extensively on a large suite of population genetic simulations presenting a wide range of potentially confounding scenarios. This tool will then be released to the public. Next, it will be applied to 26 human populations in which a large sample of genomes have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Aim 2), revealing similarities and differences in the tempo, mode, and targets of adaptive evolution across human populations. Finally, because selection on both beneficial and deleterious mutations skews genetic variation, our method will be used to identify regions of the genome least affected by natural selection, which will in turn be used to produce more accurate inferences of human demographic histories (Aim 3).  The mentored phase of this work will be performed within the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University. This is an intellectually stimulating environment with numerous journal clubs, an excellent seminar series, and several other research groups using computational techniques. The project will be performed under the stewardship of Dr. Andrew Kern, from whom the candidate will also receive training in machine learning and population genetics. Dr. Schrider will also receive training in population genetics and guidance from Dr. Jody Hey (Co-mentor) at nearby Temple University. This training will help Dr. Schrider acquire skills that will aid not only in the completion of the proposed work but also his transition to principle investigator of an internationally recognized independent research program studying the evolutionary forces driving patterns of human genetic variation. Project Narrative Detecting genes underpinning recent human adaptation remains a major challenge, and such genes are often associated with human disease. The work proposed here seeks to use supervised machine learning techniques to detect genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation across 26 different human populations. This work will also clarify human population size and migration histories, information that has implications for the prevalence of disease-causing mutations and efforts to identify them.",Inferring selection from human population genomic data,9666926,R00HG008696,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'International', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'disease-causing mutation', 'driving force', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human population genetics', 'learning strategy', 'population migration', 'pressure', 'programs', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R00,2019,242725,0.0146522470696343
"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns,9886424,K23NS110927,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Archives', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Physiology', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lobar', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'arteriole', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain parenchyma', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypertension control', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'risk variant', 'serial imaging', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,179997,-0.007373373866966872
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,9661406,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Community Medicine', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,404309,-0.0002103194942240358
"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed understanding of admixture is essential for effective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on phenotype are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simplified models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This proposal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to leverage this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate powerful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as effectively as homogeneous populations. The first step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statistical framework to infer fine-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop effective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major impact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to efficiently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human phenotypes, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on fine-scale genomic structure and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can benefit from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,9774249,R35GM125055,"['Admixture', 'Alleles', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic evolution', 'insight', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'structural genomics', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2019,332952,0.032280626974499495
"Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics Microbial population genetic research has been crucial for understanding pathogen dynamics, virulence, host specificity, and many other topics; in many cases uncovering unexpected and transformative biological processes. However, conventional population genetic analyses are limited by the quantity of sequence data from each sample. The temporal, spatial, and evolutionary resolution of techniques that rely on single gene sequences or multi-locus sequence typing are often insufficient to study biological processes on fine scales, precisely the scales at which many evolutionary and mechanistic process occur. Population genomics offers a vast quantity of sequence information for inferring evolutionary and ecological processes on very fine spatial and temporal scales, inferences that are critical to understanding and eventually controlling many infectious diseases. The promise of population genomics is tempered, however, by difficulties in isolating and preparing microbes for next-generation sequencing. We have developed the selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technology to sequence microbial genomes from complex biological specimens without relying on labor-intensive laboratory culture, even if the focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule fraction of the natural sample. The primary hindrance to popular adoption of SWGA for microbial genomic studies is not its effectiveness in producing samples suitable for next-generation sequencing but in the upfront investment needed to develop an effective protocol to amplify the genome of a specific microbial species. Identifying an SWGA protocol that consistently results in selective and even amplification across the target genome is currently hindered by computationally-inefficient software that can evaluate a very limited set of the potentially effective solutions. Further, this software uses marginally-effective optimality criteria as there is currently only a limited understanding of the true criteria that result in highly-selective and even amplification of a target genome. As a result, SWGA protocol development is currently costly in both time and resources. A primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the criteria that result in optimal SWGA by analyzing next- generation sequencing data with advanced machine learning techniques. These optimality criteria will be integrated into a freely-available, computationally-efficient swga development program that will reduce the upfront investment in SWGA protocol development, thus allowing researchers to address medically- and biologically-important questions in any microbial species. In the near term, this project will also generate effective SWGA protocols for four microbial species which can be used immediately to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, disease progression, and emerging infectious disease dynamics. From a global disease perspective, this work is imperative as the majority of microbial species cannot easily be cultured and are in danger of becoming bystanders in the genomics revolution that is currently elucidating evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms in cultivable microbial species. Addressing many of the major outstanding questions about pathogen evolution will require analyses of populations of microbial genomes. Although population genomic studies would provide the analytical resolution to investigate evolutionary and mechanistic processes on fine spatial and temporal scales – precisely the scales at which these processes occur – microbial population genomic research is currently hindered by the practicalities of obtaining sufficient quantities of genomes to analyze. We propose to develop an innovative, cost-effective, practical, and publically-available technology to collect sufficient quantities of microbial genomic DNA necessary for next-generation microbial genome sequencing.",Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics,9699440,R21AI137433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratory culture', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genome Sequencing', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protocol development', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,186101,0.0075454744724111926
"Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes Komor – Project Summary/Abstract - “Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes”  While targeted genome editing, the introduction of a specific modification in genomic DNA, has the potential to allow researchers to study and better understand mechanisms of human genetic diseases, traditional genome editing methods (including CRISPR-Cas9) that rely on the initial introduction of double stranded DNA breaks (DSB) suffer from modest genome editing efficiencies as well as unwanted gene alterations (indels), particularly when attempting to correct point mutations. Recently, a class of genome editing agents called single base editors was developed that does not involve DSBs, but rather uses a dCas9-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) modifying enzyme to directly chemically modify target nucleobases within a ~5 nucleotide window determined by the protospacer. Two classes of editors have been developed that use cytosine and adenine deamination chemistries to catalyze the conversion of C•G base pairs to T•A (CBEs), and A•T base pairs to G•C (ABEs), respectively. Here we propose the development and characterization of new base editors capable of facilitating new point mutations using methylation chemistry. We have use a bioinformatic approach to identify RNA modifying enzymes that have the potential to be repurposed into new base editors, and have rationally designed mutant libraries to use with directed evolution to convert these enzymes into base editors (Aim 1). Concurrently, we are developing a machine learning program that utilizes existing ssDNA modifying enzymes to identify putative mutations that will expand the substrate scope of the identified methyltransferases to ssDNA (Aim 2). Mutations identified from both strategies will then be tested and characterized for base editing in multiple orthogonal systems (Aim 3). The successful completion of the proposed work will represent a significant addition to existing base editing technologies, and will enable researchers to cleanly and efficiently install two additional types of point mutations into the genome of living cells, allowing researchers to quickly and effectively general model systems for the study of human genetic diseases. Komor – Project Narrative - “Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes” Base editing enables high efficiency genomic point mutation introduction in a variety of cell types and has the potential to allow researchers to better study human genetic diseases. We propose transformative improvements to current base editing technologies that will expand the types of point mutations that can be introduced by base editors.

"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9672510,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2019,336445,0.0049477686964276525
"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award. Narrative We will refine the operations of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford in coordination with other Phase II sites of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to diagnose the undiagnosed and facilitate a transition to sustainability. Our Center will bring Stanford’s long history in technology development, genomic data analysis, stem cell biology, and translational science to the team-based diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed disease. We will refine existing procedures to further optimize the diagnostic process and integrate care of the undiagnosed into clinical practice while preserving the scientific mission of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network.",Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford,9789914,U01HG010218,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Award', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child Health', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Organoids', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policy Maker', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'operation', 'outreach', 'patient outreach', 'phenotypic data', 'preservation', 'programs', 'reference genome', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'socioeconomics', 'stem cell biology', 'success', 'support network', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virtual']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,1500000,0.015595345445141344
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9694279,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2019,341691,-0.026860301066440186
"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics.

"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9700030,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric infection', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,26919,0.019122580414495962
"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,9786822,R01LM012895,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,399965,0.0075533424345318005
"Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic PROJECT SUMMARY We are in the midst of a genomic revolution; more than 250,000 human genomes have been sequenced, generating over a petabase of genomic data. While these new data hold great promise to impact health, there is a disconnect between genomic discovery and clinical care. Providers frequently misinterpret genomic information, patients often don't understand their own test results, and genomic information about disease risk is infrequently shared between patients and family members. Importantly, ineffective communication and data misinterpretation has devastating consequences- including unnecessary organ removal, missed disease prevention opportunities, and premature death. We are addressing these genomic care gaps by developing and testing tools that optimize the integration of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES, WGS) for general clinical practice. My vision for improving genomic medicine is based on my work within multidisciplinary consortia and addresses the National Human Genome Research Institute's priority research area of improving the effectiveness of healthcare. In the proposed work we will test the effectiveness of a multilevel genomic e-Health intervention in cancer (Aim 1). Our intervention 1) educates physicians and patients about genomics, 2) enables direct-to-patient return-of- results, 3) provides physicians with patient-specific results and resources for interpretation, and 4) facilitates sharing of genomic results within families. We hypothesize that intervention use will result in higher rates of uptake of high-quality, genetically guided care. We will test our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial among academic and community physicians who use WES for their patients. Next, we will use an iterative process, with stakeholder engagement, to adapt and pilot test our tool for Spanish and Mandarin speaking patients and for patients who have diabetes (Aim 2). Finally, we will create and assess new, moderated, social networks as a platform for genomic information sharing (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that providers, patients and family members will engage with the genomic information sharing social networks and find them to be highly useful. Our general approach includes 1) creating the secure social networks, 2) integrating the networks into our e-Health intervention, and 3) using complementary methods, such as interviews and natural language processing, to assess stakeholders' network-related attitudes and network information quality. If successful, we will be well positioned to widely disseminate our e-Health tools. In sum, this work stands to transform how people obtain, process and share genomic information in the context of clinical care. Our tools reconceive genetic communication to allow for multi-directional flow of information, connects multiple stakeholders with one another, and integrates high-quality dynamic web-based resources to improve genomic care. In creating and deploying tools that both respond to and leverage the complexities of our information environment, we intend to transform genomic research and clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ RELEVANCE OF PROJECT TO RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH Widespread utilization of genomic sequencing in medicine creates an urgent need to educate providers and patients. Currently, providers frequently misinterpret genomic information and patients often don't understand their own test results. In order to address this critical need, we propose to design and test multiple e-Health communication tools that will help providers and patients to better understand genomic data, lead to higher quality patient care, and facilitate genomic information sharing within families.",Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic,9815293,R35HG010721,"['Address', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Community Physician', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Social Network', 'Sum', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'eHealth', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'online resource', 'premature', 'tool', 'uptake', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,R35,2019,556256,0.005595764513038977
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9694287,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,340259,0.0007864044326186342
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9646340,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2019,249000,0.012418262715226728
"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9693291,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contig', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2019,397125,0.0004229558486235557
"Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies Project Summary  To address the burden of mental illness, National institute of Mental Health encourages development of computational approaches that provide novel ways to understand relationships among complex, large datasets to further the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of mental diseases. These datasets are multi- dimensional, including clinical assessments, behavioral symptoms, biological measurements such as neu- roimaging and psychophysiological data. The overall objective of this grant is to advance methodology for analyzing such data to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease, to improve the understanding of individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes, and to provide the capac- ity to handle both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.  Our proposal will leverage two civilian trauma cohorts recruited through the Grady Trauma Project and the Grady Emergency Department Study, and an external validation cohort from the Hill Center study with a similar distribution of trauma exposure. We propose to develop statistically principled, computationally efﬁ- cient statistical learning methods for addressing key challenges in analyzing these large datasets. Challenges include multi-type outcomes, high dimensional data with sparse signals and high noise levels, spatial and tem- poral dependence of neuroimaging data, and heterogeneous effects across patient population. The scientiﬁc premise of this computational psychiatry research is that analytical methods integrating information from brain, behavior, and symptoms will provide much-needed data driven platforms for improving diagnosis and prediction of PTSD and other mental disorders.  In this application, we propose: (1) to develop partial generalized tensor regression methods and partial tensor quantile regression methods that can simultaneously achieve accurate prediction of clinical outcomes and efﬁcient feature extraction from high dimensional neuroimaging biomarkers; (2) to develop tensor response quantile regression methods and global inference that can achieve comprehensive and robust understanding of the heterogeneity in high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotypes in terms of environmental factors such as trauma exposure; and (3) to develop and extend methods in Aims 1 and 2 for longitudinal multi-dimensional data that will enable prediction of future post-trauma symptom severity trajectories in terms of neuroimaging biomarkers and robustify the evaluation of the impact of psychophysiological factors on neuroimaging phe- notypes. The proposed methods will be applied to the two Grady studies to address scientiﬁc hypotheses relevant to PTSD research. We will use the Hill Center study as an independent validation cohort to evaluate the reproducibility and generalizability of the ﬁndings. User-friendly software will be developed. The proposed methodology is generally applicable to many other mental health studies with complex multi-dimensional data. Narrative We propose to develop statistical methods for analyzing large-scale and multi-dimensional data in mental health studies to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease and to help understand individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes. The applications of the proposed methods will generate new knowledge to further the understanding of the mechanism and progression of the PTSD that will lead to improved disease management strategies.","Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies",9839143,R01MH118771,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child Sexual Abuse', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'burden of illness', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predict clinical outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'user friendly software', 'vector']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614061,-0.003219574786697348
"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community. The proposed work will advance the ﬁeld of statistical genomics and facilitate trans-omics precision medicine studies of chronic diseases.

"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9757833,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2019,4129117,-0.0022305078326653846
"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared. Finally, an exploratory aim will use the PRS scores from the PGC data to generate risk scores in the lab sample to examine if there is a genetic association with conditioning deficits.  To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals. These goals will incorporate training in the epidemiology and genetics of AUD and PTSD, molecular and statistical genetics techniques, and conduct of clinical laboratory paradigms using genetic and psychophysiological measures. This training and resultant findings will capitalize on existing expertise and provide additional, focused training to allow for the development of a multimodal research program that uses large-scale genetic association findings to develop mechanism-focused laboratory studies that inform upon the development and maintenance of this complex presentation. The proposed research represents an important contribution towards advancing our understanding of the complicated and frequently comorbid phenotypes of AUD and PTSD. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing an independent research line that ultimately aims to decrease the burden of alcohol-related problems, consistent with NIAAA research priority. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur, and some of the genetic risk for these conditions is shared. This project aims to elucidate the shared molecular genetic risk and examine potential learning-based mechanisms common to both disorders, by linking large-scale genome-wide data with a clinical laboratory study.

"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9935464,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,823331,-0.0014754302590246102
"PiNDA - Fully integrated software platform for Preimplantation Genetic Testing - Aneuploidy (PGT-A) PROJECT SUMMARY  Since its inception 40 years ago, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of more than 1 million babies in the United States, and has revolutionized the field of reproductive medicine. Unfortunately, the success rate of IVF is still exceedingly low, especially for women >40 years old, with only 15.5% of implanted embryos resulting in pregnancy. This is partly due to the cytological method used for pre-implantation screening, which cannot detect the most common genetic defect during IVF, aneuploidy (i.e. chromosomal copy-number variation). Aneuploidy is linked to higher rates of miscarriage, and occurs more often in women >40 years of age; thus, aneuploidy has been a frequent target for genetic screening to improve IVF outcomes.  Pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) refers to a variety of techniques aimed at detecting changes in chromosomal copy number, with the goal of identifying high-quality euploid embryos for implantation. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it possible to screen embryos at higher levels of precision, and across a wider range of genetic defects, including mosaicism, triploidy and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite these remarkable advances, there are still significant challenges with PGT-A sequencing. Indeed, the most commonly implemented software for PGT-A (i.e. BlueFuse® ) are bundled with specific sequencing platforms (i.e. VeriSeq®), and are only designed to test for aneuploidy. Furthermore, existing pipelines are not user-friendly or customizable, which is a serious obstacle prohibiting the use of NGS by clinicians / embryologists. A more accessible bioinformatics platform is desperately needed that will bridge the gap between PGT-A sequencing and IVF outcomes.  Basepair™ is an innovator in efficient, user-friendly, web-based NGS analysis systems, with fully automated ChIP-, RNA-, ATAC-, and DNA-Seq bioinformatics pipelines available online. Here, Basepair will deliver PiNDA™, the first fully integrated software solution for comprehensive PGT-A analysis. In Aim 1, we will develop modules to test for specific chromosomal abnormalities, including mosaicism and triploidy, and validate each model with training data derived from somatic cell lines with known chromosomal aberrations. In Aim 2, we will integrate our modules into the PiNDA software system, creating a user-friendly, web-based interface that will perform full data analysis (raw data to full summary report) in <15 minutes, with no manual input required. Final data will be accessible via Basepair’s online portal, facilitating rapid data transfer from embryologists to physicians, and supporting the integration of NGS tests in IVF. Our innovative bioinformatics platform will accelerate NGS analysis for IVF, improving rates of pregnancy and advancing research in the success of IVF procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In vitro fertilization (IVF) methods have begun to leverage next-generation sequencing technologies for pre-implantation genetic testing of aneuploidy (PGT-A), expanding the array of chromosomal abnormalities that can be accurately detected. However, the vast majority of software can only distinguish one type of genetic defect (i.e. aneuploidy), are difficult to use, and are tied to distinct sequencing platforms, limiting the clinical utility of resulting analyses. Basepair™ Inc. is a pioneer in user-friendly, web-based bioinformatics pipelines, providing comprehensive services for a wide range of sequencing projects. Here, Basepair will develop an inclusive suite of software for PGT-A, compatible with sequencing data from multiple platforms. This product will be of high value to the field and will help bridge the gap between advances in DNA sequencing and IVF technology.",PiNDA - Fully integrated software platform for Preimplantation Genetic Testing - Aneuploidy (PGT-A),9846492,R43HD100280,"['ATAC-seq', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Aneuploid Cells', 'Aneuploidy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Cell Line', 'Cell division', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Culture Media', 'Cytology', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Embryo', 'Feedback', 'Fertility Agents', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Implant', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Preimplantation Diagnosis', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Summary Reports', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Triploidy', 'United States', 'Uterus', 'Woman', 'analysis pipeline', 'aneuploidy analysis', 'cell free DNA', 'design', 'early embryonic stage', 'egg', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'natural Blastocyst Implantation', 'next generation sequencing', 'phase 1 study', 'preimplantation', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'software development', 'software systems', 'sperm cell', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'web based interface']",NICHD,"BASEPAIR, INC.",R43,2019,298717,-0.014836453661351395
"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice; develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results",EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics,9902000,U01HG008679,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'County', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Economic Models', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Familial disease', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Safety', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'case finding', 'chronic rhinosinusitis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'implementation research', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized health care', 'phase 3 study', 'phenome', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational genomics', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2019,730148,0.0370313764833794
"Disentangling the Epidemiologic and Genetic Heterogeneity of Postpartum Depression to Predict Risk and Prognosis PROJECT SUMMARY Postpartum depression (PPD), a common complication of childbirth, has significant morbidity and mortality for mother and child, yet etiology is still poorly understood. PPD is a more heritable subtype of MDD, yet significant heterogeneity exists within the PPD phenotype, which may reflect differences in etiology. This study aims to disentangle the heterogeneity of PPD to understand etiology by leveraging existing data from two unique global resources, the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and the US arm of the Postpartum Depression: Action Towards Causes and Treatment Consortium. The study aims to 1) apply modern statistical learning methods in a master training set (N=63,528) and two independent testing sets (N=31,716 and N=4,978) to identify PPD subtypes, 2) identify genetic contributors to PPD subtypes and genetic overlap with other traits, and 3) examine the extent to which PPD subtypes predict longer-term mental health prognosis. This research will support my primary career goal to become an independently funded investigator with the expertise necessary to conduct integrated epidemiologic and genomic research to understand the complex etiology of PPD. My long-term research objective is to develop comprehensive risk prediction models that can ultimately be translated into effective preventive interventions and novel individualized treatments for PPD. I have expertise is in epidemiology and perinatal health, but I need additional mentored training to conduct large- scale, integrated gene-environment analyses to understand the biological basis of PPD. The specific objectives to meet my career goal are to 1) develop skills in data science to effectively analyze large, complex datasets, 2) establish an in-depth understanding of genomics and statistical genetics, and 3) understand the complex phenotypes of PPD and other related psychiatric conditions. The core mentorship team consists of Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, lead mentor, an internationally recognized expert in perinatal mental health research, and Dr. Patrick Sullivan, co-lead mentor, a psychiatric geneticist who has built a collaborative network of depression research in Scandinavia. Dr. Yun Li, co-mentor, has extensive experience in developing statistical and computational methods for genomic and high-dimensional data. Dr. Ted Reichborn-Kjennerud, co-mentor, and Drs. Helga Ask and Alexandra Havdahl, collaborators, have extensive experience with assessment of psychiatric outcomes in the MoBa cohort. Dr. Cathryn Lewis, collaborator, is a leading expert in the development of genetic risk score methodology. Their combined mentorship will place me in an ideal position to succeed as an independent investigator. This work will inform further investigation of unique contributions of genes and environment to develop multifactorial predictive models for PPD, representing an important step towards personalized medicine in perinatal mental health. The vital skills I attain during this grant award will provide a foundation for future research evaluating interventions for prevention and personalized therapeutic treatments of PPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE PPD is a common complication of childbirth with substantial morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal costs. Identifying subtypes of PPD (Aim 1), their genetic overlap with other psychiatric disorders and traits (Aim 2), and examining how they predict longer-term mental health prognosis (Aim 3) will make a significant contribution to understanding the biological underpinnings of PPD and determining potential points of intervention. Disentangling the heterogeneity of PPD and developing sophisticated risk prediction models that integrate genetic and epidemiologic risk factors could ultimately assist in early detection, differential diagnosis, and development of personalized intervention and treatment options for these devastating disorders.",Disentangling the Epidemiologic and Genetic Heterogeneity of Postpartum Depression to Predict Risk and Prognosis,9805582,K01MH120352,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Norway', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Progesterone', 'Psychometrics', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scandinavia', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'arm', 'biopsychosocial', 'career', 'chronic depression', 'cohort', 'early life adversity', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'perinatal health', 'perinatal mental health', 'perinatal period', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'reproductive', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'societal costs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'stressor', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2019,150200,0.0037439559831360437
"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk. Insights gained from this research will inform prediction, prevention, intervention, and treatment efforts by clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying SZ symptoms.",Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia,9644559,K01MH109765,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alleles', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'classification trees', 'clinical risk', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'density', 'differential expression', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'gene function', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'marijuana use', 'mind control', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'population stratification', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'regression trees', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'severe mental illness', 'sex', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trait', 'translational research program', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2019,176985,-0.0004986739882704531
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

This project aims to expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and advance identification of lncRNAs that play functional roles in psoriasis pathogenesis.",Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology,9761992,K01AR072129,"['Affect', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expression Profiling', 'Faculty', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Homing', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'London', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'career development', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'college', 'cytokine', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'immunoregulation', 'insight', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'recruit', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'skin disorder', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistical center', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2019,98982,0.018187144311971666
"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9752596,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,323659,-0.014198521806819265
"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III, we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders–familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)–we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches. In partnership with Mountain Park Health Center, a primary care practice that serves a minority population of Mexican Americans in Phoenix AZ, we will contribute high-density genotyping and phenotype data on 1000 Hispanics for genomic discovery and pilot mechanisms for implementing genomic medicine at this site.

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9894990,U01HG008657,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'education resources', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'online resource', 'outreach', 'patient portal', 'polyposis', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2019,707923,0.02642202718732316
"lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data PROJECT SUMMARY The onset of most human disease involves numerous molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway, and treatment contexts. This system is probed by thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, and integrative analysis of these data can generate testable hypotheses identifying causal genetic variants and linking them to network level changes in cells to disease phenotypes. This can enable deeper molecular-level understanding of pathophysiology, paving the way to genome-based precision medicine.  The long term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through integrative analysis of high- throughput biological data in a disease context. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration methods, created algorithms for the prediction of disease genes through context-specific and mechanistic network models and analysis of quantitative genetics data, and made novel insights into important biological processes and diseases. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by building public interactive systems capable of real-time user-driven integration that are popular among experimental biologists.  We now propose to connect these gene-level functional network approaches with the underlying genomic variation by deciphering how genomic variants lead to specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. We propose to develop ab initio sequence-level models capable of predicting biochemical effects of any genomic variant (including rare or never observed) on chromatin state and RNA regulation, then link these effects with gene-level regulatory consequences (including tissue-specific transcription and RNA splicing), and finally put genomic sequence directly into the network context via a statistical approach for detecting genes and network neighborhoods with a significantly elevated mutational burden in disease. Our key deliverable will be a user- friendly, interactive web-based framework enabling systems-level variant impact analysis in a network context and an open source library for computational scientists. In addition to systematic analysis across contexts and diseases, we will collaborate with experimentalists to apply our methods to Alzheimer’s, autism spectrum disorders, chronic kidney disease, immune diseases, and congenital heart defects as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to directly contribute to better understanding of these diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE To pave the way for mechanistic interpretation of disease in the genomic context and eventually, precision medicine, we will develop algorithms for de novo prediction of functional biochemical effects of noncoding variants at the DNA regulation and RNA processing levels and then build frameworks for sequence-based prediction of tissue-specific transcription and post-transcriptional RNA processes (starting with splicing). To facilitate discovery of disease mechanisms, we will develop approaches for analyzing these variant effects in a network context, including those developed in the previous grant period (mechanistic and functional networks) and novel network models that integrate exon usage information or enhancer-gene interactions. In addition to verifying top predictions experimentally in our group or by our collaborators in case study areas of neurodegenerative disease, chronic kidney disease, ASD, and congenital heart disease, we will make our methods available to the broader biomedical community through public, interactive user interfaces and open source libraries.",lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9740445,R01GM071966,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histones', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Imagery', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunology', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'congenital heart disorder', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,440312,-0.026385313462382085
"Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats Project Summary (Overall)  The purpose of this renewal application is to continue the successful activities of our center, which uses quantitative genetic techniques to study the genetic basis of drug abuse-related behaviors in outbred rats. When our center was initially funded in June 2014, our goal was to develop outbred N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as a platform for genetic studies of behaviors that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. The first four years of funding have allowed us to establish a vibrant community of investigators using HS rats to study drug abuse and other traits, which we refer to as an ecosystem. This ecosystem includes both the investigators who are directly involved in this renewal application and many others who have obtained separate funding, some from NIDA, and some from other sources. The growth of this ecosystem reflects one of the ways that our center has served as national resource. We are proposing three projects that involved phenotyping HS rats for a variety of traits, including intravenous cocaine and nicotine self-administration, response to novelty, social behavior, reaction time, and delay discounting. Two of those projects are continuations from the prior funding period and are designed to increase our sample size from 1,600 to 3,200 rats per phenotype. We present data showing that such an increase produces an exponential increase in the number of significant findings. This approach parallels human genetics studies of SUD, which have also benefited tremendously from larger sample sizes. We will use these data to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a suite of related techniques. In addition, we will measure gene expression in behaviorally naïve rats using RNASeq and use those data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate GWAS and eQTL data in an effort to identify specific genes that influence the behavioral phenotypes. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also study genetic correlations, perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) and explore a novel strategy called polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS), that is intended to allow translation of polygenic signals across species. Project 4 will use a network-based approach to extend our GWAS to account for known biological networks. This proposed renewal also includes a pilot project core to support new directions and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. Finally we propose an administrative core that supports many activities of the center, including educational, career development and public outreach. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genes in a range of psychologically complex behaviors and will provide novel biological insights that may support future efforts at preventing or treating drug abuse. Project Narrative (Overall)  Using powerful genetic, molecular and statistical techniques, we will study the genetic basis of traits that have well-established relevance to drug abuse. We expect that these studies will enhance our understanding of drug abuse and lead to the identification of specific genes and pathways. These discoveries will improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to drug abuse in humans and may identify new opportunities to treat psychiatric disorders including but not limited to addiction.",Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats,9793600,P50DA037844,"['Adolescent', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crime', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Esthesia', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Individual', 'Intravenous', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Network-based', 'Nicotine', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Self Administration', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Reinforcement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'discount', 'discounting', 'drug abuse related behavior', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'premature', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P50,2019,2949105,-0.017603372832741937
"Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rare monogenic forms of common diseases have provided key fundamental insights about common disease. However, genetic, environmental, and stochastic elements influence risk for disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder afflicting 1 in 250 linked to severe increases in LDL cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, is an ideal model to characterize modifiers of disease. Despite the presence of a strong genetic driver of hypercholesterolemia from FH mutations, we recently observed that half do not have the expected severe hypercholesterolemia. In this proposal, we outline several methods to discover and dissect the genetic and non-genetic factors influencing CHD risk conferred by FH mutations in humans and determine whether knowledge of these factors can improve risk discrimination among those with FH mutations. Our approach harnesses several multi-dimensional datasets: whole genome sequences, metabolomics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will aggregate and curate 75,000 deep (30X) whole genome sequences and cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will discover genetic and non-genetic modifiers of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk in FH and evaluate their metabolomic consequences. In Aim 3, we will develop a method incorporating genetics and longitudinal non- genetic exposures for CHD risk stratification among ~4,000 with FH mutations in the Million Veteran Program. In addition to the proposed Aims, this five-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's (PI's) scientific and professional development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The research strategy builds upon the PI's prior research experience and clinical training. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and master's degree in Biomedical Informatics, he completed post- graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Medicine. He recently developed a new preventive/genetic cardiology clinic focusing on the evaluation and management of those with or a family history of premature CHD, including those with FH, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills in human genetics and genomics into new domains: integrative genomics, statistical genetics, clinical informatics, and risk modeling. The career development goals will be at achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentorship, collaboration, didactic coursework, conferences, and scientific investigation. This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of MGH and the Broad Institute. Successful completion of this career development award will result in improved fundamental understanding of the determinants of CHD, result in the PI's transition to an independent physician-scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for R01-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cardiovascular disease, largely due to coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death in the United States and now worldwide despite current advances. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a relative common genetic disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and premature CHD but many carrying these mutations do not develop these consequences. This proposal seeks to define and characterize the factors modifying CHD risk among those with FH mutations; success has the potential to broadly identify new mechanisms of CHD and novel strategies for prevention.",Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model,9609507,K08HL140203,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Amish', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Biochemical', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'heart disease risk', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'next generation', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170003,-0.010850778189819539
"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. The computational tools stemming from this research will enable efficient and accurate inference under complex population genetic models, thereby broadly facilitating research efforts to understand the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk.",Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics,9552183,R01GM094402,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'STEM research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic selection', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'open source', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,297725,0.027986396249769036
"A Modular Automated Platform for Large-scale Drosophila Experiments and Handling PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Animal model systems are a powerful tool researchers use to investigate almost all aspects of biology: genetics, development, neuroscience, disease, and more. And fruit flies – Drosophila melanogaster – with their small size, easy care, and remarkable array of available genetic toolkits, occupy a sweet spot on the model organism spectrum. Over 75% of human diseases with a genetic basis have an analogue in the fly, and Drosophila have been a part of the research for six Nobel prizes. Furthermore, the advent of CRISPR/cas9 and other modern genetic tools has opened the door to modeling other diseases and pathways, leading to greater use of Drosophila for drug screens. A great deal of the work (and the majority of the budget) involved in fly experiments is tedious manual labor, and with advances in computer vision, machine learning, and other analytic techniques, the stage is set to automate many phenotypic screens. In this Phase I SBIR, we propose a robotic system – modular automated platform for large-scale experiments (MAPLE) – that can accomplish a wide variety of fly-handling tasks in Drosophila labs. This robot is the fruit fly version of a liquid handling robot, with a large, open workspace that can house a plethora of modules and several manipulators that can move small parts and animals around that workspace. Building on a collaboration between the de Bivort Lab and FlySorter completed in 2017, we will design, fabricate and validate a commercial system that can collect virgin flies, run behavioral assays, conduct drug screens, and adapt to the needs of fly labs through easy-to-code Python scripts. By strategically combining modules and instructions to the robot, MAPLE can perform a wide variety of tasks in a fly lab, saving experimentalists from repetitive chores, cutting labor costs, and increasing scientific output. Just as pipette robots have become standard equipment in wet labs, we envision our fly handling robot will be the engine that powers Drosophila labs in academia and pharma, enabling new kinds of experiments and freeing researchers from the drudgery of fly pushing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fruit flies – Drosophila melanogaster – are a powerful model organism used in the study of disease, neuroscience, development, genetics, and recently in drug screens, too, largely through phenotypic screening. This labor-intensive work is time consuming and expensive, and ripe for automation. We propose a fly-handling robot – analogous to a liquid pipetting robot in a wet lab – that can perform a variety of tasks in Drosophila labs, free researchers from the drudgery of fly pushing, and enable a broader spectrum of experiments that will increase scientific knowledge.",A Modular Automated Platform for Large-scale Drosophila Experiments and Handling,9623017,R43MH119092,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Automation', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data Collection', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic study', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences', 'Nobel Prize', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vacuum', 'Work', 'analog', 'bone', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'human disease', 'improved', 'operation', 'programs', 'repository', 'robot control', 'screening', 'tool', 'touchscreen']",NIMH,"FLYSORTER, LLC",R43,2018,348007,-0.012425599112389045
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,9406205,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immunology procedure', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Ships', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,372603,0.009267626061281179
"Population genomics of adaptation Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",Population genomics of adaptation,9554999,R01GM117241,"['Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anopheles Genus', 'Anopheles gambiae', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Catalogs', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mosquito-borne infectious disease', 'Mutation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fight against', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'malaria infection', 'malaria transmission', 'markov model', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'resistance allele', 'response', 'tool', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector mosquito']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2018,18944,-0.0333496708546078
"Inferring selection from human population genomic data Project Summary/Abstract Identifying genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation is a major challenge in population genetics. Particularly in humans, the task of confidently detecting the action of recent adaptive natural selection (or positive selection) has proved troublesome. Indeed there is considerable controversy over whether recent positive selection has a substantial impact on human genetic variation. The work proposed here will address this problem by creating a more complete map of positive selection across many human populations, identifying selection on de novo mutations as well as selection on previously standing variation.  Specifically, the proposed research seeks to construct a scan for positives election that is more robust and accurate than any currently existing methods (Aim 1). This tool will utilize supervised machine learning techniques allowing it combine information from a number of existing tests for natural selection, and will be tested extensively on a large suite of population genetic simulations presenting a wide range of potentially confounding scenarios. This tool will then be released to the public. Next, it will be applied to 26 human populations in which a large sample of genomes have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Aim 2), revealing similarities and differences in the tempo, mode, and targets of adaptive evolution across human populations. Finally, because selection on both beneficial and deleterious mutations skews genetic variation, our method will be used to identify regions of the genome least affected by natural selection, which will in turn be used to produce more accurate inferences of human demographic histories (Aim 3).  The mentored phase of this work will be performed within the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University. This is an intellectually stimulating environment with numerous journal clubs, an excellent seminar series, and several other research groups using computational techniques. The project will be performed under the stewardship of Dr. Andrew Kern, from whom the candidate will also receive training in machine learning and population genetics. Dr. Schrider will also receive training in population genetics and guidance from Dr. Jody Hey (Co-mentor) at nearby Temple University. This training will help Dr. Schrider acquire skills that will aid not only in the completion of the proposed work but also his transition to principle investigator of an internationally recognized independent research program studying the evolutionary forces driving patterns of human genetic variation. Project Narrative Detecting genes underpinning recent human adaptation remains a major challenge, and such genes are often associated with human disease. The work proposed here seeks to use supervised machine learning techniques to detect genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation across 26 different human populations. This work will also clarify human population size and migration histories, information that has implications for the prevalence of disease-causing mutations and efforts to identify them.",Inferring selection from human population genomic data,9617314,R00HG008696,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'International', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'disease-causing mutation', 'driving force', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human population genetics', 'learning strategy', 'population migration', 'pressure', 'programs', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R00,2018,249000,0.0146522470696343
"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed un- derstanding of admixture is essential for e ective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on pheno- type are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simpli ed models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This pro- posal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to lever- age this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate power- ful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as e ectively as homogeneous populations. The rst step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statis- tical framework to infer ne-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop e ective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major im- pact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to eciently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human pheno- types, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on ne-scale genomic struc- ture and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can bene t from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,9547454,R35GM125055,"['Admixture', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic evolution', 'insight', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2018,332952,0.031393867156603805
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efﬁciently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be inﬁnitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic refer- ence population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, ﬂies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions consid- ered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and ﬁnd variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and ex- pansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered in- clude: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only ﬁll signiﬁcant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientiﬁc output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9485688,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2018,336445,0.0040622988782279025
"Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics Microbial population genetic research has been crucial for understanding pathogen dynamics, virulence, host specificity, and many other topics; in many cases uncovering unexpected and transformative biological processes. However, conventional population genetic analyses are limited by the quantity of sequence data from each sample. The temporal, spatial, and evolutionary resolution of techniques that rely on single gene sequences or multi-locus sequence typing are often insufficient to study biological processes on fine scales, precisely the scales at which many evolutionary and mechanistic process occur. Population genomics offers a vast quantity of sequence information for inferring evolutionary and ecological processes on very fine spatial and temporal scales, inferences that are critical to understanding and eventually controlling many infectious diseases. The promise of population genomics is tempered, however, by difficulties in isolating and preparing microbes for next-generation sequencing. We have developed the selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technology to sequence microbial genomes from complex biological specimens without relying on labor-intensive laboratory culture, even if the focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule fraction of the natural sample. The primary hindrance to popular adoption of SWGA for microbial genomic studies is not its effectiveness in producing samples suitable for next-generation sequencing but in the upfront investment needed to develop an effective protocol to amplify the genome of a specific microbial species. Identifying an SWGA protocol that consistently results in selective and even amplification across the target genome is currently hindered by computationally-inefficient software that can evaluate a very limited set of the potentially effective solutions. Further, this software uses marginally-effective optimality criteria as there is currently only a limited understanding of the true criteria that result in highly-selective and even amplification of a target genome. As a result, SWGA protocol development is currently costly in both time and resources. A primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the criteria that result in optimal SWGA by analyzing next- generation sequencing data with advanced machine learning techniques. These optimality criteria will be integrated into a freely-available, computationally-efficient swga development program that will reduce the upfront investment in SWGA protocol development, thus allowing researchers to address medically- and biologically-important questions in any microbial species. In the near term, this project will also generate effective SWGA protocols for four microbial species which can be used immediately to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, disease progression, and emerging infectious disease dynamics. From a global disease perspective, this work is imperative as the majority of microbial species cannot easily be cultured and are in danger of becoming bystanders in the genomics revolution that is currently elucidating evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms in cultivable microbial species. Addressing many of the major outstanding questions about pathogen evolution will require analyses of populations of microbial genomes. Although population genomic studies would provide the analytical resolution to investigate evolutionary and mechanistic processes on fine spatial and temporal scales – precisely the scales at which these processes occur – microbial population genomic research is currently hindered by the practicalities of obtaining sufficient quantities of genomes to analyze. We propose to develop an innovative, cost-effective, practical, and publically-available technology to collect sufficient quantities of microbial genomic DNA necessary for next-generation microbial genome sequencing.",Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics,9507167,R21AI137433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratory culture', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genome Sequencing', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protocol development', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,242837,0.0075454744724111926
"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award.

"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9515964,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2018,341899,-0.026860301066440186
"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics. The research proposed will apply novel strategies to further develop integrative machine learning analyses of multidimensional genomic data, discover clinically relevant predictive models, and create computational tools to accelerate future research.",Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models,9526698,K99HG009678,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Advisory Committees', 'Award', 'Bioconductor', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Budgets', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupling', 'CpG Island Methylator Phenotype', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yang', 'biomarker performance', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NHGRI,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,K99,2018,112117,0.03230594535867547
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9487840,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2018,141048,0.019122580414495962
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9495704,U01GM110721,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunological Models', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2018,396544,0.02255624826393021
"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,9544417,R01LM012895,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,399949,0.0075533424345318005
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9502388,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,340491,-9.711971782626568e-05
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9441722,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2018,249000,0.012418262715226728
"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9498252,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2018,158992,0.0004229558486235557
"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated. Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9406513,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Notification', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Integration', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'bioinformatics resource', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2018,40590,0.015462977673368964
"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community. The proposed work will advance the ﬁeld of statistical genomics and facilitate trans-omics precision medicine studies of chronic diseases.

"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear.

"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared. Finally, an exploratory aim will use the PRS scores from the PGC data to generate risk scores in the lab sample to examine if there is a genetic association with conditioning deficits.  To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals. These goals will incorporate training in the epidemiology and genetics of AUD and PTSD, molecular and statistical genetics techniques, and conduct of clinical laboratory paradigms using genetic and psychophysiological measures. This training and resultant findings will capitalize on existing expertise and provide additional, focused training to allow for the development of a multimodal research program that uses large-scale genetic association findings to develop mechanism-focused laboratory studies that inform upon the development and maintenance of this complex presentation. The proposed research represents an important contribution towards advancing our understanding of the complicated and frequently comorbid phenotypes of AUD and PTSD. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing an independent research line that ultimately aims to decrease the burden of alcohol-related problems, consistent with NIAAA research priority. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur, and some of the genetic risk for these conditions is shared. This project aims to elucidate the shared molecular genetic risk and examine potential learning-based mechanisms common to both disorders, by linking large-scale genome-wide data with a clinical laboratory study. This K01 award will provide the candidate with the training necessary to pursue a multimodal program of research that aims to synthesize genetically informed research with laboratory studies of mechanism to inform upon the shared underpinnings of AUD and PTSD and advance work aimed at improving prevention and treatment efforts.",Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder,9445540,K01AA025692,"['Address', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Twin Studies', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular scale', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'psychogenetics', 'responsible alcohol use', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'trait', 'trauma exposure']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,177833,-0.036335603425673685
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9568024,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2018,4132864,-0.0022305078326653846
"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice; develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results",EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics,9515974,U01HG008679,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'County', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Economic Models', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Familial disease', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Safety', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'case finding', 'chronic rhinosinusitis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'implementation research', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized health care', 'phase 3 study', 'phenome', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational genomics', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2018,871212,0.0370313764833794
"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth. The methodology developed as part of this proposal can be extended and applied to other phenotypes of interest and inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches,9553860,K01LM012381,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Air Pollution', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Birth Rate', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Family', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Particulate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training Activity', 'Twin Studies', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Variant', 'Work', 'admixture mapping', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'economic cost', 'ethnic diversity', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic', 'statistics']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2018,176920,0.005394825026528461
"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk. Insights gained from this research will inform prediction, prevention, intervention, and treatment efforts by clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying SZ symptoms.",Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia,9429123,K01MH109765,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alleles', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'density', 'differential expression', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'gene function', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'marijuana use', 'mind control', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'population stratification', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'severe mental illness', 'sex', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trait', 'translational research program', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2018,178674,-0.0004986739882704531
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rare monogenic forms of common diseases have provided key fundamental insights about common disease. However, genetic, environmental, and stochastic elements influence risk for disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder afflicting 1 in 250 linked to severe increases in LDL cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, is an ideal model to characterize modifiers of disease. Despite the presence of a strong genetic driver of hypercholesterolemia from FH mutations, we recently observed that half do not have the expected severe hypercholesterolemia. In this proposal, we outline several methods to discover and dissect the genetic and non-genetic factors influencing CHD risk conferred by FH mutations in humans and determine whether knowledge of these factors can improve risk discrimination among those with FH mutations. Our approach harnesses several multi-dimensional datasets: whole genome sequences, metabolomics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will aggregate and curate 75,000 deep (30X) whole genome sequences and cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will discover genetic and non-genetic modifiers of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk in FH and evaluate their metabolomic consequences. In Aim 3, we will develop a method incorporating genetics and longitudinal non- genetic exposures for CHD risk stratification among ~4,000 with FH mutations in the Million Veteran Program. In addition to the proposed Aims, this five-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's (PI's) scientific and professional development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The research strategy builds upon the PI's prior research experience and clinical training. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and master's degree in Biomedical Informatics, he completed post- graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Medicine. He recently developed a new preventive/genetic cardiology clinic focusing on the evaluation and management of those with or a family history of premature CHD, including those with FH, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills in human genetics and genomics into new domains: integrative genomics, statistical genetics, clinical informatics, and risk modeling. The career development goals will be at achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentorship, collaboration, didactic coursework, conferences, and scientific investigation. This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of MGH and the Broad Institute. Successful completion of this career development award will result in improved fundamental understanding of the determinants of CHD, result in the PI's transition to an independent physician-scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for R01-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cardiovascular disease, largely due to coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death in the United States and now worldwide despite current advances. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a relative common genetic disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and premature CHD but many carrying these mutations do not develop these consequences. This proposal seeks to define and characterize the factors modifying CHD risk among those with FH mutations; success has the potential to broadly identify new mechanisms of CHD and novel strategies for prevention.",Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model,9431712,K08HL140203,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Amish', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Biochemical', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'heart disease risk', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'metabolomics', 'next generation', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2018,173296,-0.010850778189819539
"POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION,9815897,R01GM117241,[' '],NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2018,276973,-0.0333496708546078
"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9535429,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,315184,-0.014198521806819265

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome.

"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9536132,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'insight', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phenomenological models', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2018,3291017,-0.017312504744150067
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.

"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale.

"Inferring selection from human population genomic data Project Summary/Abstract Identifying genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation is a major challenge in population genetics. Particularly in humans, the task of confidently detecting the action of recent adaptive natural selection (or positive selection) has proved troublesome. Indeed there is considerable controversy over whether recent positive selection has a substantial impact on human genetic variation. The work proposed here will address this problem by creating a more complete map of positive selection across many human populations, identifying selection on de novo mutations as well as selection on previously standing variation.  Specifically, the proposed research seeks to construct a scan for positives election that is more robust and accurate than any currently existing methods (Aim 1). This tool will utilize supervised machine learning techniques allowing it combine information from a number of existing tests for natural selection, and will be tested extensively on a large suite of population genetic simulations presenting a wide range of potentially confounding scenarios. This tool will then be released to the public. Next, it will be applied to 26 human populations in which a large sample of genomes have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Aim 2), revealing similarities and differences in the tempo, mode, and targets of adaptive evolution across human populations. Finally, because selection on both beneficial and deleterious mutations skews genetic variation, our method will be used to identify regions of the genome least affected by natural selection, which will in turn be used to produce more accurate inferences of human demographic histories (Aim 3).  The mentored phase of this work will be performed within the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University. This is an intellectually stimulating environment with numerous journal clubs, an excellent seminar series, and several other research groups using computational techniques. The project will be performed under the stewardship of Dr. Andrew Kern, from whom the candidate will also receive training in machine learning and population genetics. Dr. Schrider will also receive training in population genetics and guidance from Dr. Jody Hey (Co-mentor) at nearby Temple University. This training will help Dr. Schrider acquire skills that will aid not only in the completion of the proposed work but also his transition to principle investigator of an internationally recognized independent research program studying the evolutionary forces driving patterns of human genetic variation. Project Narrative Detecting genes underpinning recent human adaptation remains a major challenge, and such genes are often associated with human disease. The work proposed here seeks to use supervised machine learning techniques to detect genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation across 26 different human populations. This work will also clarify human population size and migration histories, information that has implications for the prevalence of disease-causing mutations and efforts to identify them.",Inferring selection from human population genomic data,9333402,K99HG008696,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'International', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'disease-causing mutation', 'driving force', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human population genetics', 'learning strategy', 'population migration', 'pressure', 'programs', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NHGRI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",K99,2017,37785,0.0146522470696343
"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed un- derstanding of admixture is essential for e ective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on pheno- type are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simpli ed models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This pro- posal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to lever- age this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate power- ful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as e ectively as homogeneous populations. The rst step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statis- tical framework to infer ne-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop e ective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major im- pact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to eciently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human pheno- types, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on ne-scale genomic struc- ture and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can bene t from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,9382936,R35GM125055,"['Admixture', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'insight', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2017,225087,0.031393867156603805
"Population genomics of adaptation Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",Population genomics of adaptation,9383198,R01GM117241,"['Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anopheles Genus', 'Anopheles gambiae', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Catalogs', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mosquito-borne infectious disease', 'Mutation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'fight against', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'malaria infection', 'malaria transmission', 'markov model', 'novel', 'resistance allele', 'response', 'tool', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector mosquito']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2017,295480,-0.0333496708546078
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9287487,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2017,367055,-0.026860301066440186
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9275314,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2017,142177,0.019122580414495962
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9279143,U01GM110721,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronaviridae', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunological Models', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2017,202814,0.02255624826393021
"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study? (3) How to accurately capture possible interactions between multiple genetic factors and their joint contribution to phenotypic variation? In particular, we will develop data structures and efficient algorithms for accurate and robust significance assessment that account for local population structure and joint effect of multiple genetic factors.    The proposed computational tools will be integrated into software packages under common application framework adopted by the broad scientific community.

"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9308279,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,366940,-9.711971782626568e-05
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year.

"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated.               Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9189635,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Notification', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Integration', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2017,38800,0.015462977673368964
"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The PAGE study focuses on analysis of existing large samples of primarily non- European ancestry to broaden our understanding of the ethnic differences in the genetic basis of complex disease.

"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear. This project focuses on building new flexible, data-adaptive tools to translate this wealth of low level information into actionable discoveries, and actual biological understanding.",Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics,9349367,DP5OD019820,"['Address', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polynomial Models', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'convict', 'data to knowledge', 'flexibility', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP5,2017,326784,0.02792475018966651
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9479556,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2017,4412707,-0.0022305078326653846
"OMOP information model for eMERGE phenotyping ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.

"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth. The methodology developed as part of this proposal can be extended and applied to other phenotypes of interest and inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches,9324358,K01LM012381,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Air Pollution', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Birth Rate', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Family', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Particulate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training Activity', 'Twin Studies', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Variant', 'Work', 'admixture mapping', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'economic cost', 'ethnic diversity', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic', 'statistics']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2017,176920,0.005394825026528461
"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk. Insights gained from this research will inform prediction, prevention, intervention, and treatment efforts by clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying SZ symptoms.        ",Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia,9243309,K01MH109765,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'density', 'differential expression', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'gene function', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'marijuana use', 'mind control', 'novel', 'population stratification', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'severe mental illness', 'sex', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trait', 'translational research program', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2017,158132,-0.0004986739882704531
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III; we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)-we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches.

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome.

We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9551116,U01HG008657,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Community of Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Libraries', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'online resource', 'outreach', 'polyposis', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2017,842722,0.02642202718732316
"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9320861,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'insight', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phenomenological models', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2017,2548493,-0.017312504744150067
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,8994718,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'flu', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor binding', 'research study', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,370329,0.009267626061281179
"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. The computational tools stemming from this research will enable efficient and accurate inference under complex population genetic models, thereby broadly facilitating research efforts to understand the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk.",Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics,9145232,R01GM094402,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic selection', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'open source', 'pressure', 'stem', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2016,303092,0.027986396249769036
"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts.

"Inferring selection from human population genomic data Project Summary/Abstract Identifying genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation is a major challenge in population genetics. Particularly in humans, the task of confidently detecting the action of recent adaptive natural selection (or positive selection) has proved troublesome. Indeed there is considerable controversy over whether recent positive selection has a substantial impact on human genetic variation. The work proposed here will address this problem by creating a more complete map of positive selection across many human populations, identifying selection on de novo mutations as well as selection on previously standing variation.  Specifically, the proposed research seeks to construct a scan for positives election that is more robust and accurate than any currently existing methods (Aim 1). This tool will utilize supervised machine learning techniques allowing it combine information from a number of existing tests for natural selection, and will be tested extensively on a large suite of population genetic simulations presenting a wide range of potentially confounding scenarios. This tool will then be released to the public. Next, it will be applied to 26 human populations in which a large sample of genomes have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Aim 2), revealing similarities and differences in the tempo, mode, and targets of adaptive evolution across human populations. Finally, because selection on both beneficial and deleterious mutations skews genetic variation, our method will be used to identify regions of the genome least affected by natural selection, which will in turn be used to produce more accurate inferences of human demographic histories (Aim 3).  The mentored phase of this work will be performed within the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University. This is an intellectually stimulating environment with numerous journal clubs, an excellent seminar series, and several other research groups using computational techniques. The project will be performed under the stewardship of Dr. Andrew Kern, from whom the candidate will also receive training in machine learning and population genetics. Dr. Schrider will also receive training in population genetics and guidance from Dr. Jody Hey (Co-mentor) at nearby Temple University. This training will help Dr. Schrider acquire skills that will aid not only in the completion of the proposed work but also his transition to principle investigator of an internationally recognized independent research program studying the evolutionary forces driving patterns of human genetic variation. Project Narrative Detecting genes underpinning recent human adaptation remains a major challenge, and such genes are often associated with human disease. The work proposed here seeks to use supervised machine learning techniques to detect genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation across 26 different human populations. This work will also clarify human population size and migration histories, information that has implications for the prevalence of disease-causing mutations and efforts to identify them.",Inferring selection from human population genomic data,9180486,K99HG008696,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'disease-causing mutation', 'driving force', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human population genetics', 'learning strategy', 'population migration', 'pressure', 'programs', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NHGRI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",K99,2016,83411,0.0146522470696343
"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease. The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.",Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations,9126587,R01GM104125,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Inbreeding', 'Influentials', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'genetic resource', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'prospective', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,241086,0.014547231738967029
"Statistical and computational analysis in whole genome sequencing studies. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate several issues arising from the statistical and computational analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) based genomics studies. In the area of data management in WGS studies, we address the rapidly increasing cost associated with the transfer and storage of the massive files for the sequence reads and their associated quality scores. We will develop data compression methods to achieve a further compression of several folds beyond current standards, with minimal incurred errors. In the area of secondary analysis, we will develop new statistical learning methods to improve variant quality score recalibration and to filter out unreliable calls. This will improve te reliability of the key information provided by the WGS data, which are the variants calls indicating the locations where the genome differs from the reference and the nature of the differences. We will study methods for case-control studies based on WGS. In particular, we will develop statistical models to enable the integrating of information from multiple types of variants to obtain more powerful tests of association. We will apply the methods developed in this aim to the analysis of WGS data from a study on abdominal aortic aneurysm. Finally, we will address selected new questions associated with population scale WGS projects. Several national programs have recently been initiated to generate WGS data for hundreds of thousands of individuals with longitudinal medical records. The availability of this comprehensive data on a population scale will open up a rich frontier for genome medicine and will pose many new challenges for statistical analysis. We will formulate some of these new challenges and develop the statistical methods needed to meet these challenges. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research in this project concerns the design and implementation of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of data from whole genome sequencing studies.

"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9094553,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'research study', 'response', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2016,141588,0.019122580414495962
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9099895,U01GM110721,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2016,418572,0.02255624826393021

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9125796,K99CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning network', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2016,109620,0.012418262715226728
"Heterogeneous and Robust Survival Analysis in Genomic Studies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to develop powerful and computationally-efficient statistical methods for statistical modeling of high-dimensional genomic data motivated by important biological problems and experiments. The specific aims of the current project include developing novel survival analysis methods to model the heterogeneity in both patients and biomarkers in genomic studies and developing robust survival analysis methods to analyze high-dimensional genomic data. The proposed methods hinge on a novel integration of methods in high-dimensional data analysis, theory in statistical learning and methods in human genomics.

"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods.

"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth. The methodology developed as part of this proposal can be extended and applied to other phenotypes of interest and inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches,9163426,K01LM012381,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Air Pollution', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Birth Rate', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Family', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Particulate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training Activity', 'Twin Studies', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Variant', 'Work', 'admixture mapping', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'economic cost', 'ethnic diversity', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic', 'statistics']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2016,176920,0.005394825026528461
"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk. Insights gained from this research will inform prediction, prevention, intervention, and treatment efforts by clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying SZ symptoms.        ",Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia,9284856,K01MH109765,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Applied Genetics', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cocaine use', 'density', 'differential expression', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'gene function', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'marijuana use', 'mind control', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'sex', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2016,133475,-0.0004986739882704531

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs.

"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support.

"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9114170,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Mood Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phenomenological models', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2016,2560433,-0.017312504744150067
"Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Influenza A virus causes both pandemic and seasonal outbreaks, leading to loss of from thousands to millions of human lives within a short time period. Vaccination is the best option to prevent and minimize the effects of influenza outbreaks. Rapid selection of a well-matched influenza vaccine strain is the key to developing an effective vaccination program. However, this is a non-trivial task due to three major challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection: labor an time intensive virus isolation and serology-based antigenic characterization, poor growth of selected strains in chicken embryonic eggs during production, and biased sampling in influenza surveillance. Each year, many scientists worldwide, including thousands from the United States, are working altogether to select an optimal vaccine strain. However, incorrect vaccine strains have still been frequently chosen in the past decades.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing allow us to rapidly and economically sequence influenza genomes from the isolates and from the clinical samples. Sequencing influenza genomes has become a routine and important component in influenza surveillance. The objectives of this project are to develop a sequence-based strategy for influenza antigenic variant identification and to optimize vaccine strain selection using genomic data. To achieve these aims, we will develop machine learning based computational methods to estimate antigenic distances among influenza viruses by directly using their genome sequences. We will then identify the key residues and mutations in influenza genomes affecting influenza antigenic drift events. Such information will allow us to select most promising virus strains as candidates for vaccine production. Since economical virus production requires the selected virus strains to grow easily in chicken embryonic eggs, we also propose the development of a machine learning based method that can predict the growth ability of a virus strain based on its sequence information. This integrated genome based influenza vaccine strain selection system will be developed for detecting antigenic variants for influenza A viruses.  This project will help us provide fundamental technology that employs genomic signatures determining influenza antigenicity and growth ability in chicken embryonic eggs, which are the two key issues for efficient and effective influenza vaccine strain development. The resulting genome based vaccine strain selection strategy will significantly reduce the human labor needed for serological characterization, decrease the time required to select an effective strain that will grow well in eggs, and increase the likelihood of correct influenza vaccine candidate selection. Thus, this project will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This study is to develop and validate a genome based strategy for influenza vaccine strain selection, and it will lead to significant technological advances in influenza prevention and control.                ",Genome Based Influenza Vaccine Strain Selection  using Machine Learning,8859887,R01AI116744,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scientist', 'Seasons', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'egg', 'flu', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'research study', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,381704,0.009267626061281179
"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. The computational tools stemming from this research will enable efficient and accurate inference under complex population genetic models, thereby broadly facilitating research efforts to understand the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk.                ",Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics,8887722,R01GM094402,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic selection', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'open source', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'stem', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2015,303504,0.027986396249769036
"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease. The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.",Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations,8919917,R01GM104125,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Inbreeding', 'Influentials', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Recombinants', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'genetic resource', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'prospective', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,241086,0.014547231738967029
"Statistical and computational analysis in whole genome sequencing studies. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate several issues arising from the statistical and computational analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) based genomics studies. In the area of data management in WGS studies, we address the rapidly increasing cost associated with the transfer and storage of the massive files for the sequence reads and their associated quality scores. We will develop data compression methods to achieve a further compression of several folds beyond current standards, with minimal incurred errors. In the area of secondary analysis, we will develop new statistical learning methods to improve variant quality score recalibration and to filter out unreliable calls. This will improve te reliability of the key information provided by the WGS data, which are the variants calls indicating the locations where the genome differs from the reference and the nature of the differences. We will study methods for case-control studies based on WGS. In particular, we will develop statistical models to enable the integrating of information from multiple types of variants to obtain more powerful tests of association. We will apply the methods developed in this aim to the analysis of WGS data from a study on abdominal aortic aneurysm. Finally, we will address selected new questions associated with population scale WGS projects. Several national programs have recently been initiated to generate WGS data for hundreds of thousands of individuals with longitudinal medical records. The availability of this comprehensive data on a population scale will open up a rich frontier for genome medicine and will pose many new challenges for statistical analysis. We will formulate some of these new challenges and develop the statistical methods needed to meet these challenges. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research in this project concerns the design and implementation of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of data from whole genome sequencing studies.

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as our model systems, we propose to develop, evaluate and apply new analytic approaches for high-dimensional data.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data. The methods and tools are developed and evaluated in an imaging genetic study of Alzheimer's disease, and can also be applied to many other disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics,8913771,R01LM011360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Beds', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heart', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'public-private partnership', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2015,330386,0.010189182231661055
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.            ",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,8947064,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2015,142069,0.019122580414495962
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",8927659,U01GM110721,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Influenza A Virus', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2015,434391,0.02255624826393021
"Human-Specific Gain and Loss of Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will seek to utilize population genetic data to distinguish regions of the human genome experiencing purifying selection from unconstrained genomic regions. Because genomic sequences subject to selective constraint perform functions beneficial to the organism, this work will reveal previously unknown functional regions of the human genome. In particular, since this approach does not rely on comparisons between humans and closely related species, it can uncover regions acquiring or losing selective constraint after humans split from other great apes. Regions acquiring function during this time period would represent an important class of recent human adaptations, and could reveal molecular changes responsible for uniquely human phenotypes. Beyond its evolutionary importance, this work would improve the functional annotation of the human genome, revealing functional regions that could result in harmful effects if disrupted, and that cannot be detected from comparative genomic techniques. In addition to revealing human-specific gains-of- function, the proposed project would allow for detection of losses-of-function occurring since the human- chimpanzee divergence. These events could also underlie important phenotypic changes in recent human evolution, as several known human-specific losses-of-function were adaptive. Even fitness-neutral losses of function are informative, as they may reveal differences in selective pressures allowing certain functions to be lost in humans but requiring them to be maintained in our relatives. Finally, the work proposed here will combine population genetic and phylogenetic data to reveal constrained regions with better accuracy than can be achieved by examining either of these types of data alone. This will result in further improvements to the functional annotation of the human genome, especially with respect to non-protein-coding functional regions that cannot be reliably detected by ab initio techniques.  Performing this research will improve the applicant's knowledge of population genetics and computational methods that can leverage polymorphism to draw inferences about the selective and functional importance of different genomic loci. Instruction from a sponsor and co-sponsor with expertise in both of these areas, as well as interaction with other faculty members and postdocs at the sponsor's institution, will be invaluable for improving the applicant's skills. This experience wil greatly enhance the applicant's chances of achieving his goal of succeeding as an independent scientist running a lab at a research university. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to its evolutionary significance, the proposed research will reveal previously unknown regions of the human genome that perform beneficial functions. Because disruptions of these regions would have harmful effects, these findings will allow for more complete analyses of the genetic basis of disease in humans.",Human-Specific Gain and Loss of Function,8796200,F32GM105231,"['Address', 'Area', 'Beryllium', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Explosion', 'Faculty', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Pan Genus', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'driving force', 'experience', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'gain of function', 'genetic analysis', 'human population genetics', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'pressure', 'skills']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F32,2015,54194,-0.012723179943370355
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months.

"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study? (3) How to accurately capture possible interactions between multiple genetic factors and their joint contribution to phenotypic variation? In particular, we will develop data structures and efficient algorithms for accurate and robust significance assessment that account for local population structure and joint effect of multiple genetic factors.    The proposed computational tools will be integrated into software packages under common application framework adopted by the broad scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences.

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ""missing heritability"" will require moving beyond the current ""one SNP at a time"" genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate's long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ""risk profile"" score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan - statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello - developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale - statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ""discovery"" phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples - the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate's career development. The CBRPM's mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders - central topics of the candidate's career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts. This project  aims to improve understanding through advancing an integrative model of genomic,  environmental and developmental influence in the etiology of IDs.",Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders,8843959,K01MH093731,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child Care', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Family Study', 'Funding', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population Control', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scoring Method', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Sum', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'data integration', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'developmental genetics', 'follow-up', 'functional/structural genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'improved', 'indexing', 'method development', 'methylation biomarker', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'skills', 'symposium', 'trait']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,133736,0.027194979801747392
"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated.               Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9050106,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Satellite Viruses', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'disorder risk', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2015,36613,0.015462977673368964
"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear. This project focuses on building new flexible, data-adaptive tools to translate this wealth of low level information into actionable discoveries, and actual biological understanding.",Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics,8929328,DP5OD019820,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'flexibility', 'genetic makeup', 'high throughput analysis', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP5,2015,329422,0.02792475018966651
"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity.

"Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped thousands of common trait-influencing variants yet the overwhelming majority of trait loci have yet to be discovered. The goal of this proposal is to develop and apply statistical approaches that move beyond the standard GWAS paradigm to map additional trait-influencing variation within the human genome. Most of our proposed tools are based on a flexible high-dimensional framework called kernel machine regression, which we have had past success employing for powerful gene mapping of complex traits in GWAS and next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. We believe the inherent flexibility of the kernel framework makes it ideal for exploring new paradigms in gene mapping of complex human traits. Aim 1 proposes novel kernel methods for integrated analysis of both single-nucleotide variation data (derived from GWAS and/or NGS) and genomic data (such as gene-expression and methylation patterns) that we believe will provide improved power for trait mapping. Aim 2 proposes novel kernel methods for large scale gene-gene interaction analysis across the genome, as well as a computational approach that enables efficient adjustment for multiple testing when applying such exhaustive testing procedures. Aim 3 establishes novel kernel methods for association mapping of SNVs on the X chromosome. The flexible nature of kernel machines makes it ideal for modeling potential sex-specific effects on this chromosome and the methods further can accommodate random X inactivation. Aim 4 proposes novel kernel approach for robust analysis of rare trait-influencing variation within families; such family-based designs are generally not considered in current rare-variant procedures.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel and powerful statistical tools for identifying genetic loci acting independently or in conjunction with other genetic/environmental factors to influence complex human diseases or disease-related quantitative traits.

"BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization Genomic data is big and getting ever bigger, but current analysis methods will not scale to the analysis of thousands or millions of genomes. Consequently, a critical technical challenge is to develop new methods that can analyze these enormous data sets. In this proposal, we describe a new computational framework for drawing inferences from massive genomic data sets. Our approach leverages submodular summarization methods that have been developed for analyzing text corpora. We will apply these methods to five big data problems in genomics: 1) identifying functional elements characteristic o f a given human cell type; 2) identifying genomic features associated with a particular subclass of cancer; 3-4) identifying genomic variants representative of ancestrally or phenotypically defined human populations; and 5) finding a set of microbial genes that characterize a given site on the human body. This project will advance discovery and understanding on two fronts. First, we will develop novel methods for summarizing genomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data sets. Indeed, to our knowledge, this grant proposes the first application of summarization methods to genomic data of any kind. The proposed research will significantly advance our ability to apply submodularity to these summarization tasks, particularly with respect to identifying and creating a library of distance functions that have bee validated with respect to the five tasks outlined in the proposal. Second, we will apply our novel methods to problems of profound importance. Indeed, significant progress toward any one of our five tasks would represent an important advance in our scientific understanding of human history, biology or disease. The impact of this project will grow as the big data problem grows, even after the project is complete. The results of this project, both the software that we develop and the summaries that we produce, will be useful for answering a wide array of questions in any field that must cope with big data. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to an explosion of genomic data. This data contains valuable knowledge about human biology and human disease, but few existing computational methods are designed to scale to the joint analysis of tens of thousands of human genomes. This proposal adapts and extends recent advances from the field of natural language processing to characterize cancer subtvoesdiscover ofinetic variants associated with disease and characterize human microbial populations.",BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization,8840551,R01CA180777,"['Bees', 'Big Data', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Population', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'coping', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'microbial', 'novel', 'software development']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,219004,0.007030281802969877
"Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), afflicting ~1 in 10,000 North American Children, encompasses a highly heterogeneous group of chronic, immune-mediated joint disorders. Aside from causing severe pain, tissue damage, and physical immobility, chronic disease activity leads to permanent short stature and limb disfigurement. Similar to a number of other complex polygenic autoimmune diseases, there is a clear heritable component to JIA, but all known genetic risk factors explain less than 20% of disease heritability. The majority of this is attributable to variation across the Major Histocompatibility  (MHC) locus, yet definitive high-resolution identification of MHC associations in JIA have not been conclusive. JIA is currently classified into seven clinical subtypes, based on a classification schema that has little research or clinical utility, since 10-50% of cases are classified as ""undifferentiated"". Biological and molecular evidence based on the presence of serum autoantibodies and other molecular biomarkers of immunological defects suggest that the existing seven JIA subtypes could be grouped into two major classes-subtypes that represent either predominantly seropositive autoimmune (AID) diseases or seronegative autoinflammatory (AIF) diseases. Whether genetic risk factors differ for AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes is unknown, especially since the traditional approach to genetic association studies is poorly powered to identify loci with subtype- specific effects in the presence of significant phenotypic heterogeneity. To test the hypothesis that distinct genetic risk factors underlie the clinically observed differences in AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes and identify both shared and subtype-distinct genetic susceptibility loci, I propose to use a subtype-sensitive GWAS to identify JIA disease subtype-specific genetics associations, evaluate evidence for functional HLA associations that are distinct or shared across JIA subtypes, and test if the identified genetic associations can be used to predict disease susceptibility, distinguish patients who belong to AID versus AIF-like JIA classes, and reclassify patients currently defined as having undifferentiated disease. The analysis approach proposed here integrates genomic screening, disease modeling and prediction, and the use of expression and functional data resources to better understand the etiology of JIA. The successful completion of this work will likely yield novel biomolecular or pathway-based targets for the development of therapeutic agents for children with JIA and patients with other related rheumatological or immunological diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis is a severe pediatric form of immune-mediate joint disease that can result in significant morbidity and life-long disability. While the etiology of JIA, similar to other complex autoimmune and inflammatory disorders that together affect nearly 10% of the United States population, is not well-understood, a strong genetic component has been demonstrated. My proposal aims to develop novel genome-wide analysis tools and applies these tools to the identification of genetic risk susceptibility factorsin JIA and other heterogeneous, complex hereditary disorders, which have the potential to yield promising disease-specific molecular and pharmacologic targets.",Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,8879958,F30AR066486,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Siblings', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'TNFRSF10A gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'seropositive', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2015,46443,-0.013093460131921576
"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III; we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)-we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches. In partnership with Mountain Park Health Center, a primary care practice that serves a minority population of Mexican Americans in Phoenix AZ, we will contribute high-density genotyping and phenotype data on 1000 Hispanics for genomic discovery and pilot mechanisms for implementing genomic medicine at this site.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned to discover genetic variants relevant to human health and to implement genomic medicine to improve patient care.

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity.

"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.                ",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9117098,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'phenomenological models', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2015,194377,-0.017312504744150067

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.            ",Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing,8683213,R01HG006870,"['Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bruck-de Lange syndrome', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cholesterol', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Internet', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'xenopus development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2014,221252,0.012311850161001501
"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis. The proposed work will be tested on human and cancer genome data, contributing to health IT, one of the National Priority Domain Areas.",Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics,8685211,R01CA180776,"['Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Molecular Biology', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Social Policies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'data mining', 'design', 'heuristics', 'mathematical analysis']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,69189,-0.006640141831579188
"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8656359,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,492794,0.00931586982489414
"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.              The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as our model systems, we propose to develop, evaluate and apply new analytic approaches for high-dimensional data. Ultimately, these methods will allow us to derive information from the vast quantities of molecular and cellular data for personalized, clinical decisions and thus serve as a central component of translational medicine.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.             Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases.

"Statistical and computational analysis in whole genome sequencing studies.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate several issues arising from the statistical and computational analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) based genomics studies. In the area of data management in WGS studies, we address the rapidly increasing cost associated with the transfer and storage of the massive files for the sequence reads and their associated quality scores. We will develop data compression methods to achieve a further compression of several folds beyond current standards, with minimal incurred errors. In the area of secondary analysis, we will develop new statistical learning methods to improve variant quality score recalibration and to filter out unreliable calls. This will improve te reliability of the key information provided by the WGS data, which are the variants calls indicating the locations where the genome differs from the reference and the nature of the differences. We will study methods for case-control studies based on WGS. In particular, we will develop statistical models to enable the integrating of information from multiple types of variants to obtain more powerful tests of association. We will apply the methods developed in this aim to the analysis of WGS data from a study on abdominal aortic aneurysm. Finally, we will address selected new questions associated with population scale WGS projects. Several national programs have recently been initiated to generate WGS data for hundreds of thousands of individuals with longitudinal medical records. The availability of this comprehensive data on a population scale will open up a rich frontier for genome medicine and will pose many new challenges for statistical analysis. We will formulate some of these new challenges and develop the statistical methods needed to meet these challenges.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research in this project concerns the design and implementation of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of data from whole genome sequencing studies.

"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)?         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex.

"Human-Specific Gain and Loss of Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will seek to utilize population genetic data to distinguish regions of the human genome experiencing purifying selection from unconstrained genomic regions. Because genomic sequences subject to selective constraint perform functions beneficial to the organism, this work will reveal previously unknown functional regions of the human genome. In particular, since this approach does not rely on comparisons between humans and closely related species, it can uncover regions acquiring or losing selective constraint after humans split from other great apes. Regions acquiring function during this time period would represent an important class of recent human adaptations, and could reveal molecular changes responsible for uniquely human phenotypes. Beyond its evolutionary importance, this work would improve the functional annotation of the human genome, revealing functional regions that could result in harmful effects if disrupted, and that cannot be detected from comparative genomic techniques. In addition to revealing human-specific gains-of- function, the proposed project would allow for detection of losses-of-function occurring since the human- chimpanzee divergence. These events could also underlie important phenotypic changes in recent human evolution, as several known human-specific losses-of-function were adaptive. Even fitness-neutral losses of function are informative, as they may reveal differences in selective pressures allowing certain functions to be lost in humans but requiring them to be maintained in our relatives. Finally, the work proposed here will combine population genetic and phylogenetic data to reveal constrained regions with better accuracy than can be achieved by examining either of these types of data alone. This will result in further improvements to the functional annotation of the human genome, especially with respect to non-protein-coding functional regions that cannot be reliably detected by ab initio techniques.  Performing this research will improve the applicant's knowledge of population genetics and computational methods that can leverage polymorphism to draw inferences about the selective and functional importance of different genomic loci. Instruction from a sponsor and co-sponsor with expertise in both of these areas, as well as interaction with other faculty members and postdocs at the sponsor's institution, will be invaluable for improving the applicant's skills. This experience wil greatly enhance the applicant's chances of achieving his goal of succeeding as an independent scientist running a lab at a research university.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to its evolutionary significance, the proposed research will reveal previously unknown regions of the human genome that perform beneficial functions.

His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts.

"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for visual diseases.          The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.

"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear. This project focuses on building new flexible, data-adaptive tools to translate this wealth of low level information into actionable discoveries, and actual biological understanding.            ",Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics,8796068,DP5OD019820,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'flexibility', 'high throughput analysis', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP5,2014,361063,0.02792475018966651
"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation.

"Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped thousands of common trait-influencing variants yet the overwhelming majority of trait loci have yet to be discovered. The goal of this proposal is to develop and apply statistical approaches that move beyond the standard GWAS paradigm to map additional trait-influencing variation within the human genome. Most of our proposed tools are based on a flexible high-dimensional framework called kernel machine regression, which we have had past success employing for powerful gene mapping of complex traits in GWAS and next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. We believe the inherent flexibility of the kernel framework makes it ideal for exploring new paradigms in gene mapping of complex human traits. Aim 1 proposes novel kernel methods for integrated analysis of both single-nucleotide variation data (derived from GWAS and/or NGS) and genomic data (such as gene-expression and methylation patterns) that we believe will provide improved power for trait mapping. Aim 2 proposes novel kernel methods for large scale gene-gene interaction analysis across the genome, as well as a computational approach that enables efficient adjustment for multiple testing when applying such exhaustive testing procedures. Aim 3 establishes novel kernel methods for association mapping of SNVs on the X chromosome. The flexible nature of kernel machines makes it ideal for modeling potential sex-specific effects on this chromosome and the methods further can accommodate random X inactivation. Aim 4 proposes novel kernel approach for robust analysis of rare trait-influencing variation within families; such family-based designs are generally not considered in current rare-variant procedures. We will evaluate these methods on large-scale datasets that we are actively involved in and will implement the methods in user-friendly software for public distribution (Aim 5).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel and powerful statistical tools for identifying genetic loci acting independently or in conjunction with other genetic/environmental factors to influence complex human diseases or disease-related quantitative traits. Application of the proposed methods to applied datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of complex traits and enhance existing risk-prediction models of complex disease.

"Whole-Genome Prediction of Type-2 Diabetes Susceptibility in Various Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's career goal is to become a productive independent investigator in the area of statistical genetics, particularly in the area of genomic-based prediction of type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk. To meet this goal, the applicant proposes a career development plan that includes hands- on and didactic training in statistical learning as applied to quantitative genetics, categorical and case-control data analysis, informatics as applied to high dimensional genetic data, and the biology and genetics of T2D. A highly accomplished and diverse set of investigators with proven track records of successful mentoring will oversee the applicant's career development. The research component of this project seeks to improve our ability to use genetic information to predict an individual's risk of developing T2D Publically available genetic and phenotypic data from sources such as dbGaP (The database of Phenotypes and Genotypes) will be used to develop and test various models for prediction of T2D risk among three racial/ethnic groups. This project will capitalize on newly developed statistical methods that are able to incorporate information from tens of thousands of genetic markers at once, which represent a major advance over current methods that typically take fewer than 100 markers into account. The aims of the study are: 1) To test the hypothesis, in different populations, that individualized whole-genome prediction of T2D (along with standard covariates of sex, age, and BMI) will offer major improvements over current genetics-based prediction models, and will offer equal or greater accuracy than prediction based on family history; 2) To impute additional genetic markers to determine whether prediction can be improved, and to identify the subset of markers that is most useful in predicting T2D; 3) To develop prediction models for T2D risk given a certain body mass index (BMI), by including as predictors the interaction of BMI and genotypes. This project will greatly enhance our ability to predict an individual's susceptibility to T2D within various populations, leading to earlier and targeted prevention strategies, will increase our understanding of the genetic basis of T2D, and will provide critical training for Dr. Klimentidis' development as an independent scientist.      Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries. In this application, we propose to use state-of-the-art statistical methods that enable us to account for thousands of genetic variants simultaneously, in order to build and test predictive models for T2D susceptibility among individuals of European, Mexican, and African descent. This project has the potential to greatly improve prediction of T2D susceptibility in several ethnic groups, provide a better understanding of the specific genetic factors that play a role in T2D susceptibility, and ultimately bring us closer to the era of personalized medicine in which improved prediction ability results in earlier patient-oriented prevention and treatment.

"Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning  Detecting Genome-Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning Epistasis is the interaction between two or more genes to affect phenotype. It is now widely accepted that epistasis plays an important role in susceptibility to many common diseases. The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled genome-wide association studies (GWAS or GWA studies). It is compelling that we be able to detect epistasis using GWAS data. However, so far GWA studies have mainly focused on the association of a single gene or loci with a disease. The crucial challenge to analyzing epistasis using GWAS data is finding a way to efficiently handle high-dimensional data sets. The only possible solution is to design efficient algorithms that allow us to find the most relevant epistasic relationships without doing an exhaustive investigation. To the Principal Investigator's knowledge, no current method can do this. This career award will investigate this problem. The specific aims are as follows: (Aim 1) develop and evaluate efficient Bayesian network-based methods for learning candidate genes associated with diseases from GWAS sets. Such genes would provide candidates for follow-up biological studies, (Aim 2) implement the methods in a pilot GWAS system for use by researchers when conducting a GWAS, (Aim 3) develop simulated genome-wide data sets and evaluate the pilot system using these data sets, and (Aim 4) conduct GWA studies concerning breast cancer and lung cancer. Aim 1 will be addressed by developing a succinct Bayesian network model representing epistasis, efficient algorithms which are tailored to investigating such models, integration of the algorithms into methods for learning epistasis, and using simulated datasets to test the effectiveness of the methods and compare their performance to other methods. Aim 2 will be met by implementing the methods in a pilot GWAS system. Aim 3 will be satisfied by developing synthetic data sets similar to those found in GWA studies, and using them to evaluate the system. Aim 4 will be achieved by conducting GWA studies concerning breast and lung cancer. By conducting these studies, we can (1) substantiate previous results concerning the genetic basis of these diseases; (2) possibly obtain interesting new findings pertaining to these diseases. The main hypothesis is that the proposed method will be an advance over existing methods in that it will make it computationally feasible to learn epistatic relationships from genome-wide data and it will therefore yield better discovery performance than existing methods.  Learning gene-gene interactions from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data is an important and challenging task in genetic epidemiology. This project will develop and evaluate a pilot GWAS system for performing this task. Advances obtained in analyzing GWAS data sets could enable us to learn the genetic basis of many diseases and thereby substantially improve the quality of personalized patient care.",Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning,8628875,R00LM010822,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Family history of', 'GAB2 gene', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Programming', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2014,204812,-0.008317132513764147
"BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization Genomic data is big and getting ever bigger, but current analysis methods will not scale to the analysis of thousands or millions of genomes. Consequently, a critical technical challenge is to develop new methods that can analyze these enormous data sets. In this proposal, we describe a new computational framework for drawing inferences from massive genomic data sets. Our approach leverages submodular summarization methods that have been developed for analyzing text corpora. We will apply these methods to five big data problems in genomics: 1) identifying functional elements characteristic o f a given human cell type; 2) identifying genomic features associated with a particular subclass of cancer; 3-4) identifying genomic variants representative of ancestrally or phenotypically defined human populations; and 5) finding a set of microbial genes that characterize a given site on the human body. This project will advance discovery and understanding on two fronts. First, we will develop novel methods for summarizing genomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data sets. Indeed, to our knowledge, this grant proposes the first application of summarization methods to genomic data of any kind. The proposed research will significantly advance our ability to apply submodularity to these summarization tasks, particularly with respect to identifying and creating a library of distance functions that have bee validated with respect to the five tasks outlined in the proposal. Second, we will apply our novel methods to problems of profound importance. Indeed, significant progress toward any one of our five tasks would represent an important advance in our scientific understanding of human history, biology or disease. The impact of this project will grow as the big data problem grows, even after the project is complete. The results of this project, both the software that we develop and the summaries that we produce, will be useful for answering a wide array of questions in any field that must cope with big data. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to an explosion of genomic data. This data contains valuable knowledge about human biology and human disease, but few existing computational methods are designed to scale to the joint analysis of tens of thousands of human genomes. This proposal adapts and extends recent advances from the field of natural language processing to characterize cancer subtvoesdiscover ofinetic variants associated with disease and characterize human microbial populations.",BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization,8642168,R01CA180777,"['Bees', 'Big Data', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Population', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'coping', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'human disease', 'microbial', 'novel', 'software development']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,207764,0.007030281802969877
"Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), afflicting ~1 in 10,000 North American Children, encompasses a highly heterogeneous group of chronic, immune-mediated joint disorders. Aside from causing severe pain, tissue damage, and physical immobility, chronic disease activity leads to permanent short stature and limb disfigurement. Similar to a number of other complex polygenic autoimmune diseases, there is a clear heritable component to JIA, but all known genetic risk factors explain less than 20% of disease heritability. The majority of this is attributable to variation across the Major Histocompatibility  (MHC) locus, yet definitive high-resolution identification of MHC associations in JIA have not been conclusive. JIA is currently classified into seven clinical subtypes, based on a classification schema that has little research or clinical utility, since 10-50% of cases are classified as ""undifferentiated"". Biological and molecular evidence based on the presence of serum autoantibodies and other molecular biomarkers of immunological defects suggest that the existing seven JIA subtypes could be grouped into two major classes-subtypes that represent either predominantly seropositive autoimmune (AID) diseases or seronegative autoinflammatory (AIF) diseases. Whether genetic risk factors differ for AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes is unknown, especially since the traditional approach to genetic association studies is poorly powered to identify loci with subtype- specific effects in the presence of significant phenotypic heterogeneity. To test the hypothesis that distinct genetic risk factors underlie the clinically observed differences in AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes and identify both shared and subtype-distinct genetic susceptibility loci, I propose to use a subtype-sensitive GWAS to identify JIA disease subtype-specific genetics associations, evaluate evidence for functional HLA associations that are distinct or shared across JIA subtypes, and test if the identified genetic associations can be used to predict disease susceptibility, distinguish patients who belong to AID versus AIF-like JIA classes, and reclassify patients currently defined as having undifferentiated disease. The analysis approach proposed here integrates genomic screening, disease modeling and prediction, and the use of expression and functional data resources to better understand the etiology of JIA. The successful completion of this work will likely yield novel biomolecular or pathway-based targets for the development of therapeutic agents for children with JIA and patients with other related rheumatological or immunological diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis is a severe pediatric form of immune-mediate joint disease that can result in significant morbidity and life-long disability. While the etiology of JIA, similar to other complex autoimmune and inflammatory disorders that together affect nearly 10% of the United States population, is not well-understood, a strong genetic component has been demonstrated. My proposal aims to develop novel genome-wide analysis tools and applies these tools to the identification of genetic risk susceptibility factorsin JIA and other heterogeneous, complex hereditary disorders, which have the potential to yield promising disease-specific molecular and pharmacologic targets.",Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,8717915,F30AR066486,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Siblings', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'TNFRSF10A gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'tool']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2014,46078,-0.013093460131921576
"New Physical Methodologies for Genomic Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite substantial efforts in developing sequencing technologies and computational software, spanning over 30 years, the full genome of any but the simplest organisms is still unable to automatically reconstructed. The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes. These proposed advancements will be cradled within a new generation of nanofluidic devices engendering novel means for molecular control and detection. Such efforts will be directed by state-of-the art computer simulations that will model novel aspects of the new platforms for allowing rapid loops of design/implementation/testing. The main thrust of these technological developments will be carefully guided and serve a broad-based bioinformatics framework that will be developed for this work while laying the basis for highly integrated approaches to genome assembly and analysis.          Development of new machines and software is proposed, which will rapidly analyze a person's genome and reveal new types of information that doctors will be able to use for treating patients. The machines that will be developed are actually very small devices that may one day be sufficiently miniaturized to fit in a person's hand.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.                ",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),8698507,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2014,2625284,-0.017312504744150067
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.            ",Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing,8518436,R01HG006870,"['Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bruck-de Lange syndrome', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cholesterol', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Internet', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'xenopus development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2013,220626,0.012311850161001501
"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.        While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to quickly identify data sets of interest, expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate test incorporating multiple phenotypes, and perform larger meta-analyses easily by honing in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest with increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.              The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8251157,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,477069,0.00931586982489414
"Second generation sequencing and analysis for cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kevin Squire is a PhD in Electrical Engineering and former Computer Science professor with a strong interest in bioinformatics and human genetics. To this end, he joined Dr. Stanley F. Nelson's laboratory as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Human Genetics at UCLA one year ago, in order to retrain in bioinformatics and sequencing. Kevin's background in machine learning gives him a good foundation for a career in bioinformatics. What he needs, and what obtaining this grant will give him, is a good background in basic biology, biochemistry, and genetics, in order to better understand the biological processes behind the data he is working with. Kevin explorations in genetics have inspired him to make his career in this field. He hopes to gain a much better understanding of biology in order to ask and answer research questions relevant to the biology of cancer using second (and later) generation sequencing and through the use and development of relevant tools and analysis. As part of the research development plan, Kevin will complete a didactic coursework component in the first 2 years, to fill in the gaps in biology and bioinformatics in his background. During and after that, his research will focus on giving him a better understanding the genetics of cancer, attempting to answer relevant research questions from high throughput genomic sequencing data, through the use and creation of sequence analysis tools and other bioinformatics tools.

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as our model systems, we propose to develop, evaluate and apply new analytic approaches for high-dimensional data. Ultimately, these methods will allow us to derive information from the vast quantities of molecular and cellular data for personalized, clinical decisions and thus serve as a central component of translational medicine.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.              Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Human-Specific Gain and Loss of Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will seek to utilize population genetic data to distinguish regions of the human genome experiencing purifying selection from unconstrained genomic regions. Because genomic sequences subject to selective constraint perform functions beneficial to the organism, this work will reveal previously unknown functional regions of the human genome. In particular, since this approach does not rely on comparisons between humans and closely related species, it can uncover regions acquiring or losing selective constraint after humans split from other great apes. Regions acquiring function during this time period would represent an important class of recent human adaptations, and could reveal molecular changes responsible for uniquely human phenotypes. Beyond its evolutionary importance, this work would improve the functional annotation of the human genome, revealing functional regions that could result in harmful effects if disrupted, and that cannot be detected from comparative genomic techniques. In addition to revealing human-specific gains-of- function, the proposed project would allow for detection of losses-of-function occurring since the human- chimpanzee divergence. These events could also underlie important phenotypic changes in recent human evolution, as several known human-specific losses-of-function were adaptive. Even fitness-neutral losses of function are informative, as they may reveal differences in selective pressures allowing certain functions to be lost in humans but requiring them to be maintained in our relatives. Finally, the work proposed here will combine population genetic and phylogenetic data to reveal constrained regions with better accuracy than can be achieved by examining either of these types of data alone. This will result in further improvements to the functional annotation of the human genome, especially with respect to non-protein-coding functional regions that cannot be reliably detected by ab initio techniques.  Performing this research will improve the applicant's knowledge of population genetics and computational methods that can leverage polymorphism to draw inferences about the selective and functional importance of different genomic loci. Instruction from a sponsor and co-sponsor with expertise in both of these areas, as well as interaction with other faculty members and postdocs at the sponsor's institution, will be invaluable for improving the applicant's skills. This experience wil greatly enhance the applicant's chances of achieving his goal of succeeding as an independent scientist running a lab at a research university.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to its evolutionary significance, the proposed research will reveal previously unknown regions of the human genome that perform beneficial functions. Because disruptions of these regions would have harmful effects, these findings will allow for more complete analyses of the genetic basis of disease in humans.            ",Human-Specific Gain and Loss of Function,8457179,F32GM105231,"['Address', 'Area', 'Beryllium', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Explosion', 'Faculty', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Pan Genus', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'driving force', 'experience', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'gain of function', 'genetic analysis', 'human population genetics', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'skills']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F32,2013,47114,-0.012723179943370355
"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health.    Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden.

"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for visual diseases.          The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.                ",Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics,8514000,R01EY022300,"['Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,307800,-0.024310302889372106

The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation.

Most of our proposed tools are based on a flexible high-dimensional framework called kernel machine regression, which we have had past success employing for powerful gene mapping of complex traits in GWAS and next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. We believe the inherent flexibility of the kernel framework makes it ideal for exploring new paradigms in gene mapping of complex human traits. Aim 1 proposes novel kernel methods for integrated analysis of both single-nucleotide variation data (derived from GWAS and/or NGS) and genomic data (such as gene-expression and methylation patterns) that we believe will provide improved power for trait mapping. Aim 2 proposes novel kernel methods for large scale gene-gene interaction analysis across the genome, as well as a computational approach that enables efficient adjustment for multiple testing when applying such exhaustive testing procedures. Aim 3 establishes novel kernel methods for association mapping of SNVs on the X chromosome. The flexible nature of kernel machines makes it ideal for modeling potential sex-specific effects on this chromosome and the methods further can accommodate random X inactivation. Aim 4 proposes novel kernel approach for robust analysis of rare trait-influencing variation within families; such family-based designs are generally not considered in current rare-variant procedures. We will evaluate these methods on large-scale datasets that we are actively involved in and will implement the methods in user-friendly software for public distribution (Aim 5). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel and powerful statistical tools for identifying genetic loci acting independently or in conjunction with other genetic/environmental factors to influence complex human diseases or disease-related quantitative traits. Application of the proposed methods to applied datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of complex traits and enhance existing risk-prediction models of complex disease.",Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines,8598704,R01HG007508,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nuclear Family', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Sex Bias', 'Simulate', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Study models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'X inherited trait', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'sex', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,350000,-0.009461441615438274
"Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning  Detecting Genome-Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning Epistasis is the interaction between two or more genes to affect phenotype. It is now widely accepted that epistasis plays an important role in susceptibility to many common diseases. The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled genome-wide association studies (GWAS or GWA studies). It is compelling that we be able to detect epistasis using GWAS data. However, so far GWA studies have mainly focused on the association of a single gene or loci with a disease. The crucial challenge to analyzing epistasis using GWAS data is finding a way to efficiently handle high-dimensional data sets. The only possible solution is to design efficient algorithms that allow us to find the most relevant epistasic relationships without doing an exhaustive investigation. To the Principal Investigator's knowledge, no current method can do this. This career award will investigate this problem. The specific aims are as follows: (Aim 1) develop and evaluate efficient Bayesian network-based methods for learning candidate genes associated with diseases from GWAS sets. Such genes would provide candidates for follow-up biological studies, (Aim 2) implement the methods in a pilot GWAS system for use by researchers when conducting a GWAS, (Aim 3) develop simulated genome-wide data sets and evaluate the pilot system using these data sets, and (Aim 4) conduct GWA studies concerning breast cancer and lung cancer. Aim 1 will be addressed by developing a succinct Bayesian network model representing epistasis, efficient algorithms which are tailored to investigating such models, integration of the algorithms into methods for learning epistasis, and using simulated datasets to test the effectiveness of the methods and compare their performance to other methods. Aim 2 will be met by implementing the methods in a pilot GWAS system. Aim 3 will be satisfied by developing synthetic data sets similar to those found in GWA studies, and using them to evaluate the system. Aim 4 will be achieved by conducting GWA studies concerning breast and lung cancer. By conducting these studies, we can (1) substantiate previous results concerning the genetic basis of these diseases; (2) possibly obtain interesting new findings pertaining to these diseases. The main hypothesis is that the proposed method will be an advance over existing methods in that it will make it computationally feasible to learn epistatic relationships from genome-wide data and it will therefore yield better discovery performance than existing methods.  Learning gene-gene interactions from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data is an important and challenging task in genetic epidemiology. This project will develop and evaluate a pilot GWAS system for performing this task. Advances obtained in analyzing GWAS data sets could enable us to learn the genetic basis of many diseases and thereby substantially improve the quality of personalized patient care.",Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning,8440362,R00LM010822,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Family history of', 'GAB2 gene', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Programming', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'network models']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2013,193848,-0.008317132513764147
"Whole-Genome Prediction of Type-2 Diabetes Susceptibility in Various Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's career goal is to become a productive independent investigator in the area of statistical genetics, particularly in the area of genomic-based prediction of type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk. To meet this goal, the applicant proposes a career development plan that includes hands- on and didactic training in statistical learning as applied to quantitative genetics, categorical and case-control data analysis, informatics as applied to high dimensional genetic data, and the biology and genetics of T2D. A highly accomplished and diverse set of investigators with proven track records of successful mentoring will oversee the applicant's career development. The research component of this project seeks to improve our ability to use genetic information to predict an individual's risk of developing T2D Publically available genetic and phenotypic data from sources such as dbGaP (The database of Phenotypes and Genotypes) will be used to develop and test various models for prediction of T2D risk among three racial/ethnic groups. This project will capitalize on newly developed statistical methods that are able to incorporate information from tens of thousands of genetic markers at once, which represent a major advance over current methods that typically take fewer than 100 markers into account. The aims of the study are: 1) To test the hypothesis, in different populations, that individualized whole-genome prediction of T2D (along with standard covariates of sex, age, and BMI) will offer major improvements over current genetics-based prediction models, and will offer equal or greater accuracy than prediction based on family history; 2) To impute additional genetic markers to determine whether prediction can be improved, and to identify the subset of markers that is most useful in predicting T2D; 3) To develop prediction models for T2D risk given a certain body mass index (BMI), by including as predictors the interaction of BMI and genotypes. This project will greatly enhance our ability to predict an individual's susceptibility to T2D within various populations, leading to earlier and targeted prevention strategies, will increase our understanding of the genetic basis of T2D, and will provide critical training for Dr. Klimentidis' development as an independent scientist.      Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries. In this application, we propose to use state-of-the-art statistical methods that enable us to account for thousands of genetic variants simultaneously, in order to build and test predictive models for T2D susceptibility among individuals of European, Mexican, and African descent. This project has the potential to greatly improve prediction of T2D susceptibility in several ethnic groups, provide a better understanding of the specific genetic factors that play a role in T2D susceptibility, and ultimately bring us closer to the era of personalized medicine in which improved prediction ability results in earlier patient-oriented prevention and treatment.

"BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization Genomic data is big and getting ever bigger, but current analysis methods will not scale to the analysis of thousands or millions of genomes. Consequently, a critical technical challenge is to develop new methods that can analyze these enormous data sets. In this proposal, we describe a new computational framework for drawing inferences from massive genomic data sets. Our approach leverages submodular summarization methods that have been developed for analyzing text corpora. We will apply these methods to five big data problems in genomics: 1) identifying functional elements characteristic o f a given human cell type; 2) identifying genomic features associated with a particular subclass of cancer; 3-4) identifying genomic variants representative of ancestrally or phenotypically defined human populations; and 5) finding a set of microbial genes that characterize a given site on the human body. This project will advance discovery and understanding on two fronts. First, we will develop novel methods for summarizing genomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data sets. Indeed, to our knowledge, this grant proposes the first application of summarization methods to genomic data of any kind. The proposed research will significantly advance our ability to apply submodularity to these summarization tasks, particularly with respect to identifying and creating a library of distance functions that have bee validated with respect to the five tasks outlined in the proposal. Second, we will apply our novel methods to problems of profound importance. Indeed, significant progress toward any one of our five tasks would represent an important advance in our scientific understanding of human history, biology or disease. The impact of this project will grow as the big data problem grows, even after the project is complete. The results of this project, both the software that we develop and the summaries that we produce, will be useful for answering a wide array of questions in any field that must cope with big data. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to an explosion of genomic data. This data contains valuable knowledge about human biology and human disease, but few existing computational methods are designed to scale to the joint analysis of tens of thousands of human genomes. This proposal adapts and extends recent advances from the field of natural language processing to characterize cancer subtvoesdiscover ofinetic variants associated with disease and characterize human microbial populations.",BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization,8599826,R01CA180777,"['Bees', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Population', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'coping', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'human disease', 'microbial', 'novel', 'software development']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,214832,0.007030281802969877
"New Physical Methodologies for Genomic Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite substantial efforts in developing sequencing technologies and computational software, spanning over 30 years, the full genome of any but the simplest organisms is still unable to automatically reconstructed. The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes. These proposed advancements will be cradled within a new generation of nanofluidic devices engendering novel means for molecular control and detection. Such efforts will be directed by state-of-the art computer simulations that will model novel aspects of the new platforms for allowing rapid loops of design/implementation/testing. The main thrust of these technological developments will be carefully guided and serve a broad-based bioinformatics framework that will be developed for this work while laying the basis for highly integrated approaches to genome assembly and analysis.          Development of new machines and software is proposed, which will rapidly analyze a person's genome and reveal new types of information that doctors will be able to use for treating patients. The machines that will be developed are actually very small devices that may one day be sufficiently miniaturized to fit in a person's hand.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.              DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms.

"DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR JOINT GENE-ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key challenge for genetic analysis today is to account for the bulk of the phenotypic variance in complex traits that is attributable to genetic factors, but remains unexplained after multiple well-powered GWAS (Goldstein 2009; Hirschhorn 2009; Kraft and Hunter 2009). Many believe that systematically testing datasets for joint gene-environment effects (GxE) and gene-gene (GxG) effects will be essential in order to understand the genetics of complex phenotypes. However, the new era of high throughput, high-density genomic data (genotypes and sequencing) has given rise to serious computational and statistical challenges for the analysis of joint effects. The goal of this project is to develop effective strategies for the statistical analysis of joint-gene environment effects. The specific aims are to (1) identify strengths and weaknesses of multiple analytic approaches to joint GxE effects, and (2) develop new methods for coordinated meta-analysis. To accomplish Aim 1, we will systematically examine and compare traditional (e.g. regression based) and modern (e.g. partitioning, machine learning, information theoretic) analysis methods for case-control and quantitative phenotypes. The primary product will be specific guidance as to the conditions under which each method performs well. To accomplish Aim 2, we will extend recent joint-effects methods to a meta-analytic framework and develop improvements to currently used methods. For both aims, we will also analyze real data related to smoking, thereby improving our understanding of genetic and environmental contributors to smoking and addiction risk. These analyses of real data will be guided by bioinformatics-based variant prioritization. This study therefore will provide both guidance and tools needed to move the field of joint effects analysis forward. As a result, it will ultimately have a significant impact on our ability to account for the currently unexplained genetic contribution to phenotypic variance for complex traits.        Many diseases that greatly impact public health (such as heart disease, diabetes, and nicotine addiction) are the result of a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors. The purpose of this grant is to improve data analysis strategies (applicable to a wide variety of diseases) for the detection of joint effects of genes and environment. We will apply these methods to analyze existing data on smokers to improve our understanding of gene-environment effects on nicotine addiction.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.        While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to quickly identify data sets of interest, expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate test incorporating multiple phenotypes, and perform larger meta-analyses easily by honing in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest with increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.

"Pattern Discovery for comparative epigenomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a training program that will prepare an effective independent investigator in computational genomics. The candidate has a PhD in biology from the University of Cambridge and will extend his skills in both computational and wet-lab methods through a two-year program of organized mentorship and training, and a structured five-year research program.  This program will promote the command of machine learning as applied to functional genomics data. Dr. William Noble will mentor the candidate's scientific development. Dr. Noble is a recognized leader in computational biology and machine learning. He holds a dual appointment as Associate Professor in Genome Sciences and Com- puter Science and Engineering, and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Dr. Jeff Bilmes, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, will contribute to the mentoring effort, and a committee of experienced genome and computational biologists will advise on science and the candidate's career goals.  Research will focus on the analysis of multiple tracks of data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE Project. These experiments allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the structure of human chromatin, revealing the behavior of transcription factors, the organization of epigenetic modifications, and the locations of accessible DNA across the entire genome at up to single-base resolution. A current challenge is to discover joint patterns across multiple tracks of these functional genomics results simultaneously. This project will (1) develop computational methods for identifying such patterns, providing new ways of finding both well-understood genomic features and novel functional elements, (2) apply those methods to characterize the similarities and differences among different biological samples, establishing a better understanding of chromatin, the bounds of its variation, and its role in human disease, and (3) validate computational findings with laboratory experiments. The project will use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), a type of probabilistic graphical model, to represent the statistical dependencies between observed data, such as sequencing tag density, on an inferred hidden state sequence.  The Department of Genome Sciences of the University Of Washington School Of Medicine provides an ideal setting for training a new independent investigator with an extensive program of formal and informal education for postdoctoral scientists, opportunities for collaboration with researchers with expertise in diverse areas, and modern computational and laboratory resources. This environment maximizes the potential for the candidate to obtain the training and perform the research necessary to establish himself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program.         The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology. Additionally, the research will result in improved methodology and software resources for analyzing functional genomics data, and a better understanding of how chromatin state affects molecular biology and human disease.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.                  The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease.

"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes. One approach to studying multigenic interactions is to introduce combinations of mutations in model organisms and observe how they affect the cell. This project proposes to develop computational strategies to guide and interpret these combinatorial perturbation studies, which will ultimately help us better understand and treat multigenic diseases.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.              Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases.

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health.    Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts.

"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for visual diseases.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.                  The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.                ",Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics,8264613,R01EY022300,"['Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2012,322000,-0.012229461871671399

"Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning  Detecting Genome-Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning Epistasis is the interaction between two or more genes to affect phenotype. It is now widely accepted that epistasis plays an important role in susceptibility to many common diseases. The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled genome-wide association studies (GWAS or GWA studies). It is compelling that we be able to detect epistasis using GWAS data. However, so far GWA studies have mainly focused on the association of a single gene or loci with a disease. The crucial challenge to analyzing epistasis using GWAS data is finding a way to efficiently handle high-dimensional data sets. The only possible solution is to design efficient algorithms that allow us to find the most relevant epistasic relationships without doing an exhaustive investigation. To the Principal Investigator's knowledge, no current method can do this. This career award will investigate this problem. The specific aims are as follows: (Aim 1) develop and evaluate efficient Bayesian network-based methods for learning candidate genes associated with diseases from GWAS sets. Such genes would provide candidates for follow-up biological studies, (Aim 2) implement the methods in a pilot GWAS system for use by researchers when conducting a GWAS, (Aim 3) develop simulated genome-wide data sets and evaluate the pilot system using these data sets, and (Aim 4) conduct GWA studies concerning breast cancer and lung cancer. Aim 1 will be addressed by developing a succinct Bayesian network model representing epistasis, efficient algorithms which are tailored to investigating such models, integration of the algorithms into methods for learning epistasis, and using simulated datasets to test the effectiveness of the methods and compare their performance to other methods. Aim 2 will be met by implementing the methods in a pilot GWAS system. Aim 3 will be satisfied by developing synthetic data sets similar to those found in GWA studies, and using them to evaluate the system. Aim 4 will be achieved by conducting GWA studies concerning breast and lung cancer. By conducting these studies, we can (1) substantiate previous results concerning the genetic basis of these diseases; (2) possibly obtain interesting new findings pertaining to these diseases. The main hypothesis is that the proposed method will be an advance over existing methods in that it will make it computationally feasible to learn epistatic relationships from genome-wide data and it will therefore yield better discovery performance than existing methods.  Learning gene-gene interactions from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data is an important and challenging task in genetic epidemiology. This project will develop and evaluate a pilot GWAS system for performing this task. Advances obtained in analyzing GWAS data sets could enable us to learn the genetic basis of many diseases and thereby substantially improve the quality of personalized patient care.",Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning,8372706,R00LM010822,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Family history of', 'GAB2 gene', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Programming', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'network models']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2012,166150,-0.008317132513764147
"Whole-Genome Prediction of Type-2 Diabetes Susceptibility in Various Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's career goal is to become a productive independent investigator in the area of statistical genetics, particularly in the area of genomic-based prediction of type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk. To meet this goal, the applicant proposes a career development plan that includes hands- on and didactic training in statistical learning as applied to quantitative genetics, categorical and case-control data analysis, informatics as applied to high dimensional genetic data, and the biology and genetics of T2D. A highly accomplished and diverse set of investigators with proven track records of successful mentoring will oversee the applicant's career development. The research component of this project seeks to improve our ability to use genetic information to predict an individual's risk of developing T2D Publically available genetic and phenotypic data from sources such as dbGaP (The database of Phenotypes and Genotypes) will be used to develop and test various models for prediction of T2D risk among three racial/ethnic groups. This project will capitalize on newly developed statistical methods that are able to incorporate information from tens of thousands of genetic markers at once, which represent a major advance over current methods that typically take fewer than 100 markers into account. The aims of the study are: 1) To test the hypothesis, in different populations, that individualized whole-genome prediction of T2D (along with standard covariates of sex, age, and BMI) will offer major improvements over current genetics-based prediction models, and will offer equal or greater accuracy than prediction based on family history; 2) To impute additional genetic markers to determine whether prediction can be improved, and to identify the subset of markers that is most useful in predicting T2D; 3) To develop prediction models for T2D risk given a certain body mass index (BMI), by including as predictors the interaction of BMI and genotypes. This project will greatly enhance our ability to predict an individual's susceptibility to T2D within various populations, leading to earlier and targeted prevention strategies, will increase our understanding of the genetic basis of T2D, and will provide critical training for Dr. Klimentidis' development as an independent scientist.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries. In this application, we propose to use state-of-the-art statistical methods that enable us to account for thousands of genetic variants simultaneously, in order to build and test predictive models for T2D susceptibility among individuals of European, Mexican, and African descent. This project has the potential to greatly improve prediction of T2D susceptibility in several ethnic groups, provide a better understanding of the specific genetic factors that play a role in T2D susceptibility, and ultimately bring us closer to the era of personalized medicine in which improved prediction ability results in earlier patient-oriented prevention and treatment.              Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries.

"Research Education in Statistical Genetics of Substance Abuse This application seeks support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse R25 mechanism for pre-doctoral and postdoctoral research positions at the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics (VIPBG) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The overall goal of this research education program is to provide an environment that encourages the development and application of statistical genetics at the highest levels. To accomplish this goal, a research education program in statistical genetics will been developed to foster interdisciplinary research, a key tenet of the NIDA mission, and which we believe is essential to conducting research in this field. Two areas of research focus are identified: Advanced Genetic Epidemiology and Statistical Molecular Genetics. These areas are synergistic and address a diverse variety of statistical methods, both those in current use and those under development. The research education program consists of pre-doctoral and postdoctoral components. Pre-doctoral participants will pursue degrees in either Human and Molecular Genetics or Biostatistics. This component is designed to recruit, at the earliest time in their careers, potential future investigators to research in statistical genetics focused on substance use, abuse and dependence (SUAD). The aim is to create a cohort of PhD graduates who are have been extensively exposed to, and begun to publish research in, this area at the outset of their research training. The postdoctoral component recognizes that many promising young researchers have training in areas relevant to, but not focused on, the statistical genetics of substance use and abuse. This flexible 2-3 year postdoctoral training component will help guide young investigators to this field of study and will provide them with integrated and focused training that will enable them to pursue careers in statistical genetics of SUAD. Research education is intended for individuals with training in mathematics, statistics, biostatistics, genetics, psychology or pharmacology and to those who have completed their clinical requirements for the MD degree. The goal of the postdoctoral component is to educate independent investigators who will contribute to the efforts to identify and characterize the genetic and environmental determinants of SUAD; they are expected to do so at VCU and at other institutions nationwide. To accomplish the overall program goal we will: i) Offer and carefully monitor a multidisciplinary integrated research training program with a range of research opportunities; ii) Meet the needs for training in emerging research areas in SUAD; iii) Provide training to researchers from diverse academic and ethnic backgrounds and intensive mentoring; iv) Provide a specialized curriculum that will merge strengths in SUAD research at our institution; and v) Disseminate course materials, developed software, user guides and example scripts to the wider community by teaching workshops and establishing a website with web casts, pod casts and script libraries.

"New Physical Methodologies for Genomic Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite substantial efforts in developing sequencing technologies and computational software, spanning over 30 years, the full genome of any but the simplest organisms is still unable to automatically reconstructed. The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information.

"DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR JOINT GENE-ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key challenge for genetic analysis today is to account for the bulk of the phenotypic variance in complex traits that is attributable to genetic factors, but remains unexplained after multiple well-powered GWAS (Goldstein 2009; Hirschhorn 2009; Kraft and Hunter 2009). Many believe that systematically testing datasets for joint gene-environment effects (GxE) and gene-gene (GxG) effects will be essential in order to understand the genetics of complex phenotypes. However, the new era of high throughput, high-density genomic data (genotypes and sequencing) has given rise to serious computational and statistical challenges for the analysis of joint effects. The goal of this project is to develop effective strategies for the statistical analysis of joint-gene environment effects. The specific aims are to (1) identify strengths and weaknesses of multiple analytic approaches to joint GxE effects, and (2) develop new methods for coordinated meta-analysis. To accomplish Aim 1, we will systematically examine and compare traditional (e.g. regression based) and modern (e.g. partitioning, machine learning, information theoretic) analysis methods for case-control and quantitative phenotypes. The primary product will be specific guidance as to the conditions under which each method performs well. To accomplish Aim 2, we will extend recent joint-effects methods to a meta-analytic framework and develop improvements to currently used methods. For both aims, we will also analyze real data related to smoking, thereby improving our understanding of genetic and environmental contributors to smoking and addiction risk. These analyses of real data will be guided by bioinformatics-based variant prioritization. This study therefore will provide both guidance and tools needed to move the field of joint effects analysis forward. As a result, it will ultimately have a significant impact on our ability to account for the currently unexplained genetic contribution to phenotypic variance for complex traits.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many diseases that greatly impact public health (such as heart disease, diabetes, and nicotine addiction) are the result of a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors. The purpose of this grant is to improve data analysis strategies (applicable to a wide variety of diseases) for the detection of joint effects of genes and environment. We will apply these methods to analyze existing data on smokers to improve our understanding of gene-environment effects on nicotine addiction.              Many diseases that greatly impact public health (such as heart disease, diabetes, and nicotine addiction) are the result of a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies.

"Pattern Discovery for comparative epigenomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a training program that will prepare an effective independent investigator in computational genomics. The candidate has a PhD in biology from the University of Cambridge and will extend his skills in both computational and wet-lab methods through a two-year program of organized mentorship and training, and a structured five-year research program.  This program will promote the command of machine learning as applied to functional genomics data. Dr. William Noble will mentor the candidate's scientific development. Dr. Noble is a recognized leader in computational biology and machine learning. He holds a dual appointment as Associate Professor in Genome Sciences and Com- puter Science and Engineering, and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Dr. Jeff Bilmes, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, will contribute to the mentoring effort, and a committee of experienced genome and computational biologists will advise on science and the candidate's career goals.  Research will focus on the analysis of multiple tracks of data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE Project. These experiments allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the structure of human chromatin, revealing the behavior of transcription factors, the organization of epigenetic modifications, and the locations of accessible DNA across the entire genome at up to single-base resolution. A current challenge is to discover joint patterns across multiple tracks of these functional genomics results simultaneously. This project will (1) develop computational methods for identifying such patterns, providing new ways of finding both well-understood genomic features and novel functional elements, (2) apply those methods to characterize the similarities and differences among different biological samples, establishing a better understanding of chromatin, the bounds of its variation, and its role in human disease, and (3) validate computational findings with laboratory experiments. The project will use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), a type of probabilistic graphical model, to represent the statistical dependencies between observed data, such as sequencing tag density, on an inferred hidden state sequence.  The Department of Genome Sciences of the University Of Washington School Of Medicine provides an ideal setting for training a new independent investigator with an extensive program of formal and informal education for postdoctoral scientists, opportunities for collaboration with researchers with expertise in diverse areas, and modern computational and laboratory resources. This environment maximizes the potential for the candidate to obtain the training and perform the research necessary to establish himself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8054816,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,513100,0.00931586982489414
"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes. One approach to studying multigenic interactions is to introduce combinations of mutations in model organisms and observe how they affect the cell.

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as our model systems, we propose to develop, evaluate and apply new analytic approaches for high-dimensional data. Ultimately, these methods will allow us to derive information from the vast quantities of molecular and cellular data for personalized, clinical decisions and thus serve as a central component of translational medicine.           The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health. Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables. Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD.

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts.

"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"Statistical Methods for Correlated and High-Dimensional Biomedical Data We propose in the renewal of this MERIT award application to continue developing advanced statistical and computational methods for analysis of correlated and high-dimensional data, which arise frequently in health science research, especially in cancer research. Correlated data are often observed in observational studies and clinical trials, such as longitudinal studies and familial studies. High-dimensional data have emerged rapidly in recent years due to the advance of high-throughput 'omics technologies, e.g, in Genome- Wide Association Studies (GWAS), and genome-wide epigenetic (DNA methylation) studies. Massive next generation sequencing data are soon available. There is an urgent need to develop advanced stati stical and computational methods for analyzing such high throughput 'omics data in observational studies and clinical trials. We propose to develop statistical and computational methods for analysis of (1) genome-wide association studies; (2) sequencing data for studying rare variant effects; (3) genome-wide DNA methylation studies; (4) gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. We will develop methods for both case-control studies and cohort studies, such as longitudinal studies and survival studies. We will study the theoretical properties of the proposed methods and evaluate the finite s ample performance using simulation studies. We will develop efficient numerical algorithms and user-friendly statistical software, and disseminate these tools to health sciences researchers.

"Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Epistasis is the interaction between two or more genes to affect phenotype. It is now widely accepted that epistasis plays an important role in susceptibility to many common diseases. The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled genome-wide association studies (GWAS or GWA studies). It is compelling that we be able to detect epistasis using GWAS data. However, so far GWA studies have mainly focused on the association of a single gene or loci with a disease. The crucial challenge to analyzing epistasis using GWAS data is finding a way to efficiently handle high-dimensional data sets. The only possible solution is to design efficient algorithms that allow us to find the most relevant epistasic relationships without doing an exhaustive investigation. To the Principal Investigator's knowledge, no current method can do this.       This career award will investigate this problem. The specific aims are as follows: (Aim 1) develop and evaluate efficient Bayesian network-based methods for learning candidate genes associated with diseases from GWAS sets. Such genes would provide candidates for follow-up biological studies, (Aim 2) implement the methods in a pilot GWAS system for use by researchers when conducting a GWAS, (Aim 3) develop simulated genome-wide data sets and evaluate the pilot system using these data sets, and (Aim 4) conduct GWA studies concerning breast cancer and lung cancer.       Aim 1 will be addressed by developing a succinct Bayesian network model representing epistasis, efficient algorithms which are tailored to investigating such models, integration of the algorithms into methods for learning epistasis, and using simulated datasets to test the effectiveness of the methods and compare their performance to other methods. Aim 2 will be met by implementing the methods in a pilot GWAS system. Aim 3 will be satisfied by developing synthetic data sets similar to those found in GWA studies, and using them to evaluate the system. Aim 4 will be achieved by conducting GWA studies concerning breast and lung cancer. By conducting these studies, we can (1) substantiate previous results concerning the genetic basis of these diseases; (2) possibly obtain interesting new findings pertaining to these diseases.       The main hypothesis is that the proposed method will be an advance over existing methods in that it will make it computationally feasible to learn epistatic relationships from genome-wide data and it will therefore yield better discovery performance than existing methods.              Learning gene-gene interactions from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data is an important and challenging task in genetic epidemiology. This project will develop and evaluate a pilot GWAS system for performing this task. Advances obtained in analyzing GWAS data sets could enable us to learn the genetic basis of many diseases and thereby substantially improve the quality of personalized patient care.",Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning,8145599,K99LM010822,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Family history of', 'GAB2 gene', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Programming', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'network models']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2011,90000,-0.008711325401658568
"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors.

"Human Variation Detection and Visualization on the DNAnexus Web 2.0 platform    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNAnexus proposes to develop a complete solution for the identification and stratification of personal genetic variation from ultra-high-throughput sequencing projects. The solution will be implemented as a Web 2.0 service and online browsing tool that will integrate public data sources such as the 1000 genomes project, comparative information, and the ENCODE II project data. Users will be able to browse and stratify the identified variation in the context of these genomic annotations, and according to the likely functional impact. In Phase I of our project, we will develop a basic browser for displaying sequence reads that are mapped to a reference genome with our state-of-the-art read mapper. The browser will support viewing mate paired reads as well as display of the variation between these reads and the reference genome. It will facilitate the algorithmic development that we will perform during Phase II, and it will be the foundation for the more sophisticated variation browser also proposed in Phase II. In Phase II, we will develop algorithms for detecting genomic variation, and a state-of-the-art browser for viewing variation in the context of existing genome annotations, functional genomic and comparative genomic data. Our algorithms for detecting variation will support all major types of genomic variation, including SNPs, microindels, larger insertions and deletions, duplications, copy number variations, inversions, and translocations. Our algorithms will be based on state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning methodology for human genome resequencing.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7930715,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,288566,-0.004626603120702942

"Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic variants and environmental factors interacting in a composite and potentially nonlinear manner. Although the genome-wide views provided by advanced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays present an opportunity to discover previously unrecognized genomic patterns, the ability to recognize such complex features of genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association study to discover genetic determinants of health and disease from massive genomic data. The focus of this application is the development and validation of effective computational statistics approaches to detect complex interaction effects of multi-locus SNPs which could be useful for classification and prediction of disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of complex phenotypes. Based on very promising preliminary studies, the specific aims of this R21 application are carefully designed: (1) to refine and evaluate the recently developed significant conditional association (SCA) criterion and heuristic combinatorial interaction growing (HCIG) search strategy (specifically designed to discover complex interaction effects of multi-locus jointly-predictive SNPs), test and validate on real SNP based realistic simulations and compare with a panel of most relevant existing methods; and (2) to apply SCA- HCIG method to the real SNP data of NIAMS-funded FMS cohort in relationship to metabolic syndrome etc. and develop SNP marker based classification/ prediction models, assessed by the prediction power and initial biological plausibility of the implicated SNP subsets. This proposal represents a unique cross-disciplinary collaboration focusing on the development of new analytical methods to more effectively identify interacting susceptibility SNPs and environmental factors that can be used to determine individual risk to a specific disease and to estimate prognosis and response to treatment. The results could also suggest novel preventive intervetions and therapeutic targets, reduce the burden of diseases, and accelerate the realization of truly personalized medicine.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Wang, Yue (Joseph), Ph.D. Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects Project Narrative  Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic and environmental factors.

"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes.

"Multi-point and multi-locus analysis of genomic association data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a new and powerful approach to investigate the effect of inherited genetic variation on risks of complex diseases.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.          Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health. Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables. Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD.

"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma. The work proposed here will contribute both statistical methodology to modeling genomic data with graphical structures, to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and methods for high-dimensional data analysis, and offer insight into each of the clinical areas represented by the various data sets to evaluate these new methods.

"Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envirnonmental Network Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The efforts of the human genome project are beginning to provide important findings for human health. Technological advances in the laboratory, particularly in characterizing human genomic variation, have created new approaches for studying the human genome. However, current statistical and computational strategies are taking only partial advantage of this wealth of information. In the quest for disease susceptibility genes for common, complex disease, we are faced with many challenges. Selecting genetic, clinical, and environmental factors important for the trait of interest is increasingly more difficult as high throughput data generation technologies are developed. We know that genes do not act in isolation, thus numerous other factors are likely important in complex disease phenotypes. However, techniques for robust statistical modeling of important variables to predict clinical outcomes are limited in their capability for interaction effects. Ultimately, we want to know what factors are important to provide superior prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, interpretation of statistical models in a meaningful way for biomedical research has been lacking due to the inherent difficulty in making such connections. Thus, a technology that embraces the complexity of human disease and integrates multiple data sources including biological knowledge from the public domain, through a powerful analytical framework is essential for dissecting the architecture of common diseases. ATHENA: the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations is a novel framework that incorporates variable selection, modeling, and interpretation to learn more about diseases of public health interest. As the field gains experience in analyzing large scale genomic data, it is crucial that we learn from each other and develop and codify the best strategies.            Many common, complex diseases are likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Out ability to extract all of the meaningful information from very large genomic and phenotypic datasets has been limited by our analytic strategies.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases.

"Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Epistasis is the interaction between two or more genes to affect phenotype. It is now widely accepted that epistasis plays an important role in susceptibility to many common diseases. The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled genome-wide association studies (GWAS or GWA studies). It is compelling that we be able to detect epistasis using GWAS data. However, so far GWA studies have mainly focused on the association of a single gene or loci with a disease. The crucial challenge to analyzing epistasis using GWAS data is finding a way to efficiently handle high-dimensional data sets. The only possible solution is to design efficient algorithms that allow us to find the most relevant epistasic relationships without doing an exhaustive investigation. To the Principal Investigator's knowledge, no current method can do this.       This career award will investigate this problem. The specific aims are as follows: (Aim 1) develop and evaluate efficient Bayesian network-based methods for learning candidate genes associated with diseases from GWAS sets. Such genes would provide candidates for follow-up biological studies, (Aim 2) implement the methods in a pilot GWAS system for use by researchers when conducting a GWAS, (Aim 3) develop simulated genome-wide data sets and evaluate the pilot system using these data sets, and (Aim 4) conduct GWA studies concerning breast cancer and lung cancer.       Aim 1 will be addressed by developing a succinct Bayesian network model representing epistasis, efficient algorithms which are tailored to investigating such models, integration of the algorithms into methods for learning epistasis, and using simulated datasets to test the effectiveness of the methods and compare their performance to other methods. Aim 2 will be met by implementing the methods in a pilot GWAS system. Aim 3 will be satisfied by developing synthetic data sets similar to those found in GWA studies, and using them to evaluate the system. Aim 4 will be achieved by conducting GWA studies concerning breast and lung cancer. By conducting these studies, we can (1) substantiate previous results concerning the genetic basis of these diseases; (2) possibly obtain interesting new findings pertaining to these diseases.       The main hypothesis is that the proposed method will be an advance over existing methods in that it will make it computationally feasible to learn epistatic relationships from genome-wide data and it will therefore yield better discovery performance than existing methods.              Learning gene-gene interactions from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data is an important and challenging task in genetic epidemiology. This project will develop and evaluate a pilot GWAS system for performing this task.

"Pathway-based analysis of addiction susceptibility genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to alcohol and substance dependence is known to be influenced by genetic factors. However, few specific genetic variations that alter susceptibility to addiction have been identified. This is partly because addiction is a polygenic trait, influenced by many genetic variations, each with a small marginal effect. Phenotypic characteristics are controlled by networks of interacting biochemical and physiological pathways influenced by the products of specific genes. While single genetic variants result in small changes in susceptibility to complex diseases, it is the combined effects of genes within a biochemical pathway that likely drive phenotype expression.  The research proposed in this application aims to apply novel pathway-based methods to analyze existing data from a genome wide association study of alcoholism. Case-control alcohol dependence data from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), collected by Dr. Laura Bierut and colleagues, will be analyzed. The methods that will be applied take into account known relationships between genes and their products and assess the effect of gene-sets that represent biological pathways, rather than assessing individual gene effects. Once significant pathways are identified, comprehensive analyses of genes within these pathways will be performed, to characterize the genetic effects, including interactions between genetic variations. These analyses will utilize random forest methods and LASSO logistic regression with gene-gene interaction effects.  The long term goals of this research are to improve the detection of interacting genetic risk factors for substance addiction and subtypes of substance use disorders, by applying optimal statistical techniques. While studying all possible interactions between SNPs from a genome-wide scan may not be practical, a focused approach of investigating genetic interactions within a relevant pathway is expected to be more powerful and yield interpretable results.  Analysis of existing data using new statistical methods that account for the relationships between genes that act as part of common neural or molecular pathways has great potential to identify genetic variations that contribute to individual differences in addiction susceptibility. Discovery of such genetic risk factors has important implications including increasing our understanding of the pathways of development of addiction and risk prediction. Perhaps more importantly, this knowledge is expected to help identify subtypes of addiction that require different interventions leading to personalized treatment with increased success rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified. Recently, new methods for analyzing genetic data have been proposed that take into account known relationships between genes that contribute to common biological pathways.

"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           n/a",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7809627,K08DE016956,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft Palate', 'Cleft lip with or without cleft palate', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'computer based statistical methods', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oral cleft', 'psychologic', 'skills', 'surveillance study']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2010,129456,0.0352333085003466
"Machine Learning to Identify Complex Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The focus of this application is the development and validation of new computational approaches to identify complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors (features) which could be used to help identify individuals at high risk for a specific disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the conditions in question. Specific Aims of the application include: 1 )To adapt a variety of statistical machine learning methods to the analysis of simulated high density genome scan and environmental exposure data and to evaluate their ability to identify SNPs and environmental factors that are jointly predictive of a binary trait; 2)To apply the described feature selection and model building techniques to the genome-wide SNP genotype data collected from two NHLBI-funded genome-wide association studies: a) the SNPs and Atherosclerosis (SEA) study predicting premature atherosclerosis, and b) the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics of Statins (CAPS) Study predicting LDL cholesterol; 3) to develop a study-specific publicly accessible web-site designed to help disseminate the methods and results of the project and 4) to support the NIH-wide Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI). This proposal represents a unique collaboration focusing on the development of new methods to more effectively identify interacting genetic and environmental factors that account for variation in risk for common cardiovascular and other disease phenotypes. If the risk is determined, in part by a gene-environment interaction, the preventive intervention could include altering the environmental exposure. Furthermore, determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that jointly influence risk may reveal new biologic pathways that would be appropriate targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Together, improved risk stratification and new pathophysiologic insights would be expected to reduce the burden of disease and accelerate the realization of true personalized medicine. Relevance of this research to public health: This project aims to develop new approaches to identify the relationship between genetic and environmental factors which could then be used to identify people at high risk for a disease. Determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that influence a person's risk of disease may help doctors reduce risk for disease and reveal new treatments for disease.

"The Statistical and Computational Analysis of Flow Cytometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Flow cytometry is a data-rich technology that plays a critical role in basic research and clinical therapy for a variety of human diseases. Recent technological developments have greatly increased the areas of application and data throughput, and corresponding innovative analysis methods are needed.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7682282,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,291480,-0.004626603120702942
"Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic variants and environmental factors interacting in a composite and potentially nonlinear manner. Although the genome-wide views provided by advanced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays present an opportunity to discover previously unrecognized genomic patterns, the ability to recognize such complex features of genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association study to discover genetic determinants of health and disease from massive genomic data. The focus of this application is the development and validation of effective computational statistics approaches to detect complex interaction effects of multi-locus SNPs which could be useful for classification and prediction of disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of complex phenotypes. Based on very promising preliminary studies, the specific aims of this R21 application are carefully designed: (1) to refine and evaluate the recently developed significant conditional association (SCA) criterion and heuristic combinatorial interaction growing (HCIG) search strategy (specifically designed to discover complex interaction effects of multi-locus jointly-predictive SNPs), test and validate on real SNP based realistic simulations and compare with a panel of most relevant existing methods; and (2) to apply SCA- HCIG method to the real SNP data of NIAMS-funded FMS cohort in relationship to metabolic syndrome etc. and develop SNP marker based classification/ prediction models, assessed by the prediction power and initial biological plausibility of the implicated SNP subsets. This proposal represents a unique cross-disciplinary collaboration focusing on the development of new analytical methods to more effectively identify interacting susceptibility SNPs and environmental factors that can be used to determine individual risk to a specific disease and to estimate prognosis and response to treatment. The results could also suggest novel preventive intervetions and therapeutic targets, reduce the burden of diseases, and accelerate the realization of truly personalized medicine.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Wang, Yue (Joseph), Ph.D. Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects Project Narrative  Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic and environmental factors.

"Multi-point and multi-locus analysis of genomic association data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a new and powerful approach to investigate the effect of inherited genetic variation on risks of complex diseases. With recent advances in genotyping technology, genome-wide association studies are now becoming a reality. Data from GWAS are expected in an accelerated rate. Despite tremendous efforts in developing efficient algorithms for mapping complex diseases/traits, single-locus based approaches are still the primary method for GWAS. However, it is known that usually multiple genetic factors, environmental factors as well as their interactions play an important role in the etiology of complex diseases. Novel and practical approaches to simultaneously model multiple variables and their interactions from hundreds of thousands single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are greatly needed. In this project, we propose to develop efficient algorithms and practical statistical tools to address two important problems in the context of genome- wide association studies: multi-point analysis and multi-locus analysis. For multi-point analysis, our Dynamic Hidden Chain Markov Model (DHCMM) can jointly model historical recombination and muta- tions, haplotype structures and frequencies, and associations, which is expected to be more effective than existing approaches. For multi-locus analysis, we propose to use an advanced machine learning approach to jointly screen SNPs that are predictive of diseases.

"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma. The work proposed here will contribute both statistical methodology to modeling genomic data with graphical structures, to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and methods for high-dimensional data analysis, and offer insight into each of the clinical areas represented by the various data sets to evaluate these new methods.

"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7633295,R01DA018341,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Coiled Bodies', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'System', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'egg', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'neurotransmission', 'rapid technique', 'tool']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2009,293485,0.009379531501250954
"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.           Project Narrative We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome.

"Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an integrated desktop application to combine data from expression array, RNA transcript array, proteomics, SNP array (for polymorphism an analysis, as well as LOH and copy number determination), methylation array, histone modification array, promoter array, and microRNA array and metabolomics technologies. Current approaches to analysis of individual `omic' technologies suffer from problems of fragmentation, that present an incomplete view of the workings of the cell. However, effective integration into a single analytic platform is non-trivial. There is a need for a consistent approach, infrastructure, and interface between array types, to maximize ease of use, while recognizing and accommodating the specific computational and statistical requirements, and biological context, of each array. A central challenge is the need to create and work with lists of genomic regions of interest (GROIs) for each sample: we propose three novel approaches to aid in identification of GROIs. These lists must then be integrated with rectangular (sample by feature) data arrays to facilitate statistical analysis. Integration between array types occurs at the computational level, through a unified software package, statistically, through tools that seek statistical relationships between features from different arrays, biologically, through use of annotations (particularly gene ontology, protein- protein and protein-DNA interactions, and pathway membership) that document functional relationships between features, and through genomic interactions that suggest relationships between features that map to the same regions of the genome. The end product will support analysis of each platform separately, with a comprehensive suite of data management, statistical and heuristic analytic tools and the means to place findings of interest into a meaningful biological context through cross-reference to extensive biobases. Beyond that, a range of methods - statistical, biological and genomic - will be available to explore interactions and associations between platforms.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the large-scale array technologies have provided an unprecedented capability to model cellular processes, both in normal functioning and disease states, this capability is utterly dependent on the availability of complex data management, computational, statistical and informatic software tools.  The utility of the next generation of arrays - which focus on critical regulation and control functions of the cell - will be stymied by an initial lack of suitable bioinformatic tools.

"Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envirnonmental Network Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The efforts of the human genome project are beginning to provide important findings for human health. Technological advances in the laboratory, particularly in characterizing human genomic variation, have created new approaches for studying the human genome. However, current statistical and computational strategies are taking only partial advantage of this wealth of information. In the quest for disease susceptibility genes for common, complex disease, we are faced with many challenges. Selecting genetic, clinical, and environmental factors important for the trait of interest is increasingly more difficult as high throughput data generation technologies are developed. We know that genes do not act in isolation, thus numerous other factors are likely important in complex disease phenotypes. However, techniques for robust statistical modeling of important variables to predict clinical outcomes are limited in their capability for interaction effects. Ultimately, we want to know what factors are important to provide superior prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, interpretation of statistical models in a meaningful way for biomedical research has been lacking due to the inherent difficulty in making such connections. Thus, a technology that embraces the complexity of human disease and integrates multiple data sources including biological knowledge from the public domain, through a powerful analytical framework is essential for dissecting the architecture of common diseases. ATHENA: the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations is a novel framework that incorporates variable selection, modeling, and interpretation to learn more about diseases of public health interest. As the field gains experience in analyzing large scale genomic data, it is crucial that we learn from each other and develop and codify the best strategies.            Many common, complex diseases are likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Out ability to extract all of the meaningful information from very large genomic and phenotypic datasets has been limited by our analytic strategies.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.

"Pathway-based analysis of addiction susceptibility genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to alcohol and substance dependence is known to be influenced by genetic factors. However, few specific genetic variations that alter susceptibility to addiction have been identified. This is partly because addiction is a polygenic trait, influenced by many genetic variations, each with a small marginal effect. Phenotypic characteristics are controlled by networks of interacting biochemical and physiological pathways influenced by the products of specific genes. While single genetic variants result in small changes in susceptibility to complex diseases, it is the combined effects of genes within a biochemical pathway that likely drive phenotype expression.  The research proposed in this application aims to apply novel pathway-based methods to analyze existing data from a genome wide association study of alcoholism. Case-control alcohol dependence data from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), collected by Dr. Laura Bierut and colleagues, will be analyzed. The methods that will be applied take into account known relationships between genes and their products and assess the effect of gene-sets that represent biological pathways, rather than assessing individual gene effects. Once significant pathways are identified, comprehensive analyses of genes within these pathways will be performed, to characterize the genetic effects, including interactions between genetic variations. These analyses will utilize random forest methods and LASSO logistic regression with gene-gene interaction effects.  The long term goals of this research are to improve the detection of interacting genetic risk factors for substance addiction and subtypes of substance use disorders, by applying optimal statistical techniques. While studying all possible interactions between SNPs from a genome-wide scan may not be practical, a focused approach of investigating genetic interactions within a relevant pathway is expected to be more powerful and yield interpretable results.  Analysis of existing data using new statistical methods that account for the relationships between genes that act as part of common neural or molecular pathways has great potential to identify genetic variations that contribute to individual differences in addiction susceptibility. Discovery of such genetic risk factors has important implications including increasing our understanding of the pathways of development of addiction and risk prediction. Perhaps more importantly, this knowledge is expected to help identify subtypes of addiction that require different interventions leading to personalized treatment with increased success rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified. Recently, new methods for analyzing genetic data have been proposed that take into account known relationships between genes that contribute to common biological pathways. The research proposed in this application will apply such approaches to analyze data from a genetic study of alcoholism. Results of this study are expected to help identify sets of genes that contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to substance dependence, leading to improved diagnosis and management of addiction based on an individualized treatment approach.           Project Narrative: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified.

"Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use, primarily cigarette smoking, is the greatest source of preventable mortality in the world and costs over $160 million in health-related economic losses in the U.S. alone. Nicotine dependence is the primary reason that smokers continue smoking and that most unassisted quit attempts fail within a single week. It is known that nicotine dependence has a genetic component, but that it is a complex trait, i.e., no single gene is responsible for nicotine dependence. Thus, researchers and funding agencies have devoted considerable effort and support to identifying the genetic underpinnings of the trait through whole genome scans, putting us in a unique position to identify global genetic predictors of nicotine dependence. This study proposes to realize the promise of the NIDA-funded Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND) whole genome data through the accomplishment of two specific aims: (1) to identify the set of genetic variations underlying the complex trait of nicotine dependence using a cutting-edge computational method called Bayesian networks and (2) to validate the prognostic model in an entirely independent population. This proposal represents the very first step of a broader research program aimed at discovering the complex network of interactions underpinning nicotine dependence. The ultimate result of this program will provide a clinical tool, which will accurately assess the risk of dependency, allow for individualized preventive measures, elucidate the molecular processes of dependence and nominate novel targets for the pharmaceutical treatment of nicotine addiction. Nicotine dependence places an enormous burden on individuals and society. Genetic factors are responsible for at least some part of the condition, and the NIDA has already funded a study, called COGEND, that examined over 40,000 genetic variations in people who were nicotine dependent and who were not nicotine dependent. We propose to use cutting-edge techniques to analyze this large dataset to identify a valid predictive model of nicotine dependence that will help us predict, diagnose, and treat this condition.        n/a",Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance,7617627,R21DA025168,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dental Schools', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco use', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'smoking cessation', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2009,175000,-0.01196023453227797

In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           n/a",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7616441,K08DE016956,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft Palate', 'Cleft lip with or without cleft palate', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'computer based statistical methods', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oral cleft', 'psychologic', 'skills', 'surveillance study']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2009,129470,0.0352333085003466
"Machine Learning to Identify Complex Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The focus of this application is the development and validation of new computational approaches to identify complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors (features) which could be used to help identify individuals at high risk for a specific disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the conditions in question. Specific Aims of the application include: 1 )To adapt a variety of statistical machine learning methods to the analysis of simulated high density genome scan and environmental exposure data and to evaluate their ability to identify SNPs and environmental factors that are jointly predictive of a binary trait; 2)To apply the described feature selection and model building techniques to the genome-wide SNP genotype data collected from two NHLBI-funded genome-wide association studies: a) the SNPs and Atherosclerosis (SEA) study predicting premature atherosclerosis, and b) the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics of Statins (CAPS) Study predicting LDL cholesterol; 3) to develop a study-specific publicly accessible web-site designed to help disseminate the methods and results of the project and 4) to support the NIH-wide Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI). This proposal represents a unique collaboration focusing on the development of new methods to more effectively identify interacting genetic and environmental factors that account for variation in risk for common cardiovascular and other disease phenotypes. If the risk is determined, in part by a gene-environment interaction, the preventive intervention could include altering the environmental exposure. Furthermore, determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that jointly influence risk may reveal new biologic pathways that would be appropriate targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Together, improved risk stratification and new pathophysiologic insights would be expected to reduce the burden of disease and accelerate the realization of true personalized medicine. Relevance of this research to public health: This project aims to develop new approaches to identify the relationship between genetic and environmental factors which could then be used to identify people at high risk for a disease. Determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that influence a person's risk of disease may help doctors reduce risk for disease and reveal new treatments for disease.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7488003,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease regression', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,291480,-0.004626603120702942
"The Statistical and Computational Analysis of Flow Cytometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Flow cytometry is a data-rich technology that plays a critical role in basic research and clinical therapy for a variety of human diseases.

"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma. The work proposed here will contribute both statistical methodology to modeling genomic data with graphical structures, to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and methods for high-dimensional data analysis, and offer insight into each of the clinical areas represented by the various data sets to evaluate these new methods.

"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7440354,R01DA018341,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Coiled Bodies', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'System', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'egg', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'neurotransmission', 'rapid technique', 'tool']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2008,282792,0.009379531501250954
"Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an integrated desktop application to combine data from expression array, RNA transcript array, proteomics, SNP array (for polymorphism an analysis, as well as LOH and copy number determination), methylation array, histone modification array, promoter array, and microRNA array and metabolomics technologies. Current approaches to analysis of individual `omic' technologies suffer from problems of fragmentation, that present an incomplete view of the workings of the cell. However, effective integration into a single analytic platform is non-trivial. There is a need for a consistent approach, infrastructure, and interface between array types, to maximize ease of use, while recognizing and accommodating the specific computational and statistical requirements, and biological context, of each array. A central challenge is the need to create and work with lists of genomic regions of interest (GROIs) for each sample: we propose three novel approaches to aid in identification of GROIs. These lists must then be integrated with rectangular (sample by feature) data arrays to facilitate statistical analysis. Integration between array types occurs at the computational level, through a unified software package, statistically, through tools that seek statistical relationships between features from different arrays, biologically, through use of annotations (particularly gene ontology, protein- protein and protein-DNA interactions, and pathway membership) that document functional relationships between features, and through genomic interactions that suggest relationships between features that map to the same regions of the genome. The end product will support analysis of each platform separately, with a comprehensive suite of data management, statistical and heuristic analytic tools and the means to place findings of interest into a meaningful biological context through cross-reference to extensive biobases. Beyond that, a range of methods - statistical, biological and genomic - will be available to explore interactions and associations between platforms.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the large-scale array technologies have provided an unprecedented capability to model cellular processes, both in normal functioning and disease states, this capability is utterly dependent on the availability of complex data management, computational, statistical and informatic software tools.  The utility of the next generation of arrays - which focus on critical regulation and control functions of the cell - will be stymied by an initial lack of suitable bioinformatic tools.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases.

"Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use, primarily cigarette smoking, is the greatest source of preventable mortality in the world and costs over $160 million in health-related economic losses in the U.S. alone. Nicotine dependence is the primary reason that smokers continue smoking and that most unassisted quit attempts fail within a single week. It is known that nicotine dependence has a genetic component, but that it is a complex trait, i.e., no single gene is responsible for nicotine dependence. Thus, researchers and funding agencies have devoted considerable effort and support to identifying the genetic underpinnings of the trait through whole genome scans, putting us in a unique position to identify global genetic predictors of nicotine dependence. This study proposes to realize the promise of the NIDA-funded Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND) whole genome data through the accomplishment of two specific aims: (1) to identify the set of genetic variations underlying the complex trait of nicotine dependence using a cutting-edge computational method called Bayesian networks and (2) to validate the prognostic model in an entirely independent population. This proposal represents the very first step of a broader research program aimed at discovering the complex network of interactions underpinning nicotine dependence. The ultimate result of this program will provide a clinical tool, which will accurately assess the risk of dependency, allow for individualized preventive measures, elucidate the molecular processes of dependence and nominate novel targets for the pharmaceutical treatment of nicotine addiction. Nicotine dependence places an enormous burden on individuals and society. Genetic factors are responsible for at least some part of the condition, and the NIDA has already funded a study, called COGEND, that examined over 40,000 genetic variations in people who were nicotine dependent and who were not nicotine dependent. We propose to use cutting-edge techniques to analyze this large dataset to identify a valid predictive model of nicotine dependence that will help us predict, diagnose, and treat this condition.        n/a",Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance,7509667,R21DA025168,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dental Schools', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco use', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Week', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'smoking cessation', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2008,175000,-0.01196023453227797
"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           n/a",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7393693,K08DE016956,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft Palate', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'computer based statistical methods', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oral cleft', 'psychologic', 'skills']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2008,129484,0.0352333085003466
"Machine Learning to Identify Complex Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The focus of this application is the development and validation of new computational approaches to identify complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors (features) which could be used to help identify individuals at high risk for a specific disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the conditions in question. Specific Aims of the application include: 1 )To adapt a variety of statistical machine learning methods to the analysis of simulated high density genome scan and environmental exposure data and to evaluate their ability to identify SNPs and environmental factors that are jointly predictive of a binary trait; 2)To apply the described feature selection and model building techniques to the genome-wide SNP genotype data collected from two NHLBI-funded genome-wide association studies: a) the SNPs and Atherosclerosis (SEA) study predicting premature atherosclerosis, and b) the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics of Statins (CAPS) Study predicting LDL cholesterol; 3) to develop a study-specific publicly accessible web-site designed to help disseminate the methods and results of the project and 4) to support the NIH-wide Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI). This proposal represents a unique collaboration focusing on the development of new methods to more effectively identify interacting genetic and environmental factors that account for variation in risk for common cardiovascular and other disease phenotypes. If the risk is determined, in part by a gene-environment interaction, the preventive intervention could include altering the environmental exposure. Furthermore, determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that jointly influence risk may reveal new biologic pathways that would be appropriate targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Together, improved risk stratification and new pathophysiologic insights would be expected to reduce the burden of disease and accelerate the realization of true personalized medicine. Relevance of this research to public health: This project aims to develop new approaches to identify the relationship between genetic and environmental factors which could then be used to identify people at high risk for a disease. Determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that influence a person's risk of disease may help doctors reduce risk for disease and reveal new treatments for disease.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution.

"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma. The work proposed here will contribute both statistical methodology to modeling genomic data with graphical structures, to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and methods for high-dimensional data analysis, and offer insight into each of the clinical areas represented by the various data sets to evaluate these new methods.

"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7270627,R01DA018341,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Coiled Bodies', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'System', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'egg', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'neurotransmission', 'rapid technique', 'tool']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2007,279238,0.009379531501250954

"Quantitative Analysis Methods for Complex Trait Genetics DESCRIPTION: (Provided by Applicant): Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for premature death and creates a substantial public health burden. While studies have shown that smoking and nicotine dependence are complex traits influenced by significant genetic components, further research is needed to identify genes that influence susceptibility and resistance. The research goal of this proposal is to develop and evaluate new methods for the genetic analysis of complex traits in the context of career development for the candidate, Dr. Nancy Saccone. Dr. Saccone will use artificial neural networks and logistic regression models as her primary methodological tools, and will develop and apply methods especially suited for studying the complex genetics of nicotine addiction and related phenotypes. Preliminary studies have been promising and indicate that further investigation of genetic methods based on these tools is warranted. The research plan will also extend the scope of these applications to include uses for genetic association analysis, as large-scale disequilibrium and association-based approaches are expected to become increasingly important for complex trait gene mapping. Dr. Saccone has chosen Dr. John Rice as mentor and will work with additional co-mentors and consultants. The training components of this proposal will expand Dr. Saccone?s experience to include: ongoing training in the ethical conduct of research, further training in the clinical and biological aspects of nicotine and other substance addiction, and the development of expertise in the use and analysis of other kinds of genetic data besides genotypic data, such as gene expression array data, which will play increasingly important roles in the study of human complex traits.

However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7095200,R01DA018341,"['Caenorhabditis elegans', 'behavior', 'bioinformatics', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'ethology', 'molecular biology information system', 'neurogenetics', 'phenotype']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2006,293309,0.009379531501250954
"Quantitative Analysis Methods for Complex Trait Genetics DESCRIPTION: (Provided by Applicant): Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for premature death and creates a substantial public health burden. While studies have shown that smoking and nicotine dependence are complex traits influenced by significant genetic components, further research is needed to identify genes that influence susceptibility and resistance. The research goal of this proposal is to develop and evaluate new methods for the genetic analysis of complex traits in the context of career development for the candidate, Dr. Nancy Saccone. Dr. Saccone will use artificial neural networks and logistic regression models as her primary methodological tools, and will develop and apply methods especially suited for studying the complex genetics of nicotine addiction and related phenotypes. Preliminary studies have been promising and indicate that further investigation of genetic methods based on these tools is warranted. The research plan will also extend the scope of these applications to include uses for genetic association analysis, as large-scale disequilibrium and association-based approaches are expected to become increasingly important for complex trait gene mapping. Dr. Saccone has chosen Dr. John Rice as mentor and will work with additional co-mentors and consultants. The training components of this proposal will expand Dr. Saccone?s experience to include: ongoing training in the ethical conduct of research, further training in the clinical and biological aspects of nicotine and other substance addiction, and the development of expertise in the use and analysis of other kinds of genetic data besides genotypic data, such as gene expression array data, which will play increasingly important roles in the study of human complex traits.

"Statistical Methods for Genomic and Proteomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose developing, evaluating and comparing statistical methods in analyzing and interpreting microarray data, including a heart failure dataset collected in the co-Principal Investigator's lab. Some of the proposed methods will incorporate or be applied to other types of genomic or proteomic data. In Aim A.1, we consider detecting differential gene expression. A weighted permutation scheme is proposed to improve permutation-based inference procedures, and these methods will be compared with several recently proposed parametric and semi-parametric methods. We also propose incorporating existing biological data in the statistical methods. In Aim A.2, we study a clustering-based classification (CBC) method for gene function prediction using microarray data. CBC will be compared with other state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests. Other sources of biological data, such as protein-protein interaction data, will be incorporated in the proposed method. In Aim A.3, we consider sample classification and prediction based on gene expression profiles in a general framework called penalized partial least squares (PPLS). PPLS will be compared with other supervised machine learning algorithms. We will extend PPLS to combine microarray data from multiple studies. We plan to implement the proposed statistical methods in R and make the software publicly and freely available.         n/a",Statistical Methods for Genomic and Proteomic Data,6922406,R01HL065462,"['clinical research', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'human data', 'mathematical model', 'microarray technology', 'model design /development', 'proteomics', 'statistics /biometry']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES,R01,2005,174500,-0.007090501583673794

"LINKAGE AND ASSOCIATION OF GENETIC MARKERS AND DISEASE The proposed research aims to: a) Improve the understanding of the               genetics of inherited diseases with unclear modes of transmission.               Studies will evaluate the effectiveness of current methods of analysis,          including classical linkage analysis, sib-pair or affected-pedigree-             member analysis and the use of measures of association in understanding          the underlying genetic mechanisms of such traits.  Simulation studies            will continue to provide a source of family data reflecting confounding          factors thought to be a problem in linkage analysis of certain complex           traits, such as psychiatric or behavioral disorders.  Factors to be              considered include assortative mating, genetic heterogeneity and multi-          locus disease determination.  The ability of current methods to                  correctly analyze traits with one or more of these factors will be               assessed and, where appropriate, alternative methods will be developed           and tested.  b) Apply techniques of neural network pattern matching to           problems of genetic systems.  Applications include: aid in phenotype             definition for traits with multiple clinical problems of genetic                 systems.  Applications include: aid in phenotype definition for traits           with multiple clinical characteristics; determination of risk of disease         based on phenotype, known risk factors and disease profiles in                   relatives; determination of organ transplant success based on HLA                antigen matching patterns; definition of disease phenotype based on              quantitative factors.  c) Develop and apply strategies for ordering              multiple linked loci using pairwise recombination data, radiation hybrid         data, or other physical mapping data.  Some of these ordering strategies         may be adaptable to the development of techniques for integrating map            information obtained by different methods, an important step in                  organizing a comprehensive, reliable map.  d) Carry out classical                linkage analysis for specific genetic diseases.  Currently, a genome             scan is underway to identify a gene or genes for polycystic liver                disease.  Other diseases to be studied include lymphoma and prostate             cancer. Methods to be tested in the simulation studies can be applied            to these analyses in order to better understand the complete genetic             picture, including identification of heterogeneity, by detecting linkage         of different disease forms to different marker loci. Such                        differentiation will help sharpen the clinical definition of various             forms of the diseases.                                                                                                                                            As a result of advances from this work, better mathematical tools for            the study of diseases with complex or ill-defined inheritance patterns           will be available.  Applications to specific diseases will increase              understanding of interactions between clinical definition and                    predisposing genetic factors.  This will increase the precision of               genetic counseling and suggest useful approaches for studying the                mechanisms involved in determining disease state.                                 n/a",LINKAGE AND ASSOCIATION OF GENETIC MARKERS AND DISEASE,6385414,R01GM029177,"['alleles', ' artificial chromosomes', ' artificial intelligence', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' family genetics', ' gene expression', ' genetic disorder', ' genetic markers', ' genetic susceptibility', ' histocompatibility antigens', ' human data', ' human genetic material tag', ' linkage mapping', ' liver disorder', ' lymphoma', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' phenotype', ' prostate neoplasms', ' quantitative trait loci', ' sequence tagged sites']",NIGMS,NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER,R01,2001,198845,0.010397537532430423

Some of these ordering strategies         may be adaptable to the development of techniques for integrating map            information obtained by different methods, an important step in                  organizing a comprehensive, reliable map.  d) Carry out classical                linkage analysis for specific genetic diseases.  Currently, a genome             scan is underway to identify a gene or genes for polycystic liver                disease.  Other diseases to be studied include lymphoma and prostate             cancer. Methods to be tested in the simulation studies can be applied            to these analyses in order to better understand the complete genetic             picture, including identification of heterogeneity, by detecting linkage         of different disease forms to different marker loci. Such                        differentiation will help sharpen the clinical definition of various             forms of the diseases.                                                                                                                                            As a result of advances from this work, better mathematical tools for            the study of diseases with complex or ill-defined inheritance patterns           will be available.  Applications to specific diseases will increase              understanding of interactions between clinical definition and                    predisposing genetic factors.  This will increase the precision of               genetic counseling and suggest useful approaches for studying the                mechanisms involved in determining disease state.                                 n/a",LINKAGE AND ASSOCIATION OF GENETIC MARKERS AND DISEASE,6179464,R01GM029177,"['alleles', ' artificial chromosomes', ' artificial intelligence', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' family genetics', ' gene expression', ' genetic disorder', ' genetic markers', ' genetic susceptibility', ' histocompatibility antigens', ' human data', ' human genetic material tag', ' linkage mapping', ' liver disorder', ' lymphoma', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' phenotype', ' prostate neoplasms', ' quantitative trait loci', ' sequence tagged sites']",NIGMS,NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER,R01,2000,195932,0.010397537532430423
"CLASSIFICATION METHODS FOR DETECTING DISEASE LOCI DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract): Bold steps must be       taken to advance our understanding of the genetic and associated co-             variates affecting the inheritance of complex diseases. To that end, this        proposal will develop improved quantitative methods to detect genetic            factors contributing to increased susceptibility to complex disorders and        implement these methods in software for distribution to the research             community.                                                                                                                                                        The methods will concentrate on the use of classification techniques             applied to allele sharing data and other risk factors which affect the           trait. Allele sharing methods for mapping genes will be extended to              include the classification methods known as latent class models, cluster         analysis, and artificial neural networks, as well as a novel use of              logistic regression Co-variates such as gender, parental diagnosis, or           other concomitant factors will be systematically studied through                 applications to both stimulated and existing data sets. An additional goal       is to determine the optimal distribution of relative pairs (e.g. siblings,       first cousins) for these methods. Of great importance to this proposal is        the development of well-documented, user-friendly software and                   documentation which will be distributed to the scientific community via          the Internet. Existing software developed by the PI will be extensively          expanded for latent class models. Existing cluster analysis software will        be modified and combined for ease of use.                                                                                                                         This proposal consists of theoretical exploration, computer simulation,          data analysis, and software development. First, solutions of theoretical         questions relating to classification techniques will be pursued; second,         adaptation of computer programs to implement the analytic methods, and           investigation into alternative research strategies will be accomplished.         The new strategies will be applied to stimulated data, and finally, to           existing data sets of pedigrees in which a complex trait has been                diagnosed. Findings from this research may contribute to the ability to          locate susceptibility loci in complex traits and to the clarification of         those etiological mechanisms responsible for susceptibility.                      n/a",CLASSIFICATION METHODS FOR DETECTING DISEASE LOCI,6168495,R01AA012239,"['alleles', ' analytical method', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical resource', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' family genetics', ' gene environment interaction', ' gene expression', ' genetic disorder', ' genetic disorder diagnosis', ' genetic mapping', ' genetic markers', ' genetic susceptibility', ' human data', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' quantitative trait loci', ' statistics /biometry']",NIAAA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,180260,-0.002677759440725019
"MODELS IN POPULATION GENETICS The genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region control a variety          Of functions involved in the immune response, and influence                      susceptibility to over 40 diseases.  Our understanding of the structure          and function of the HLA genes, their disease associations, and the               evolutionary features of this multigene family has benefitted from recent        advances in molecular biology, immunology, disease modelling and                 population genetics.  Theoretical studies in the development of models to        determine the modes of inheritance of the HLA associated diseases have           led to a better understanding of the inheritance patterns in insulin             dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,           ankylosing spondylitis, hemochromatosis, celiac disease, and others.  It         is now clear that many of the HLA associated diseases involve                    heterogeneity in their HLA components, as well as non-HLA genetic                components.                                                                                                                                                       The specific aims of our research are to study the genetic components in         the etiology of the HLA associated diseases, and population genetic              features of the HLA system.  A variety of methods to test modes of               inheritance of diseases using marker allele information, will be                 developed.  Methods appropriate for the analysis of marker systems which         are not highly polymorphic, to both detect linkage and determine modes of        inheritance, will be investigated.  The information content of particular        pedigree types for LOD score analysis will be investigated.  Two methods         using patterns of linkage disequilibrium will be investigated to                 determine their usefulness in mapping disease predisposing genes.  A             number of large collaborative data sets of HLA associated diseases will          be analyzed.  A framework for genetic counselling of HLA associated, and         other complex diseases, will be developed.  The results of our studies           are generally applicable to the mapping and characterization of complex          human genetic traits.                                                             n/a",MODELS IN POPULATION GENETICS,6180774,R01GM056688,"['European', "" Hodgkin's disease"", ' MHC class I antigen', ' MHC class II antigen', ' T cell receptor', ' alleles', ' antiserum', ' artificial intelligence', ' biochemical evolution', ' celiac disease', ' computer assisted sequence analysis', ' computer data analysis', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' gene frequency', ' genetic counseling', ' genetic disorder diagnosis', ' genetic markers', ' genetic models', ' genetic polymorphism', ' genotype', ' hereditary hemochromatosis', ' heterozygote', ' histocompatibility antigens', ' histocompatibility gene', ' homozygote', ' human genetic material tag', ' human population genetics', ' immunogenetics', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus', ' linkage disequilibriums', ' mathematical model', ' molecular genetics', ' multiple sclerosis', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' oligonucleotides', ' restriction fragment length polymorphism', ' rheumatoid arthritis', ' serotyping', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2000,283617,0.001463695850387288
"Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies PROJECT SUMMARY Viral hepatitis from hepatitis B (HBV) establishes chronic infections in >250M people worldwide; chronicity is on the rise, and approximately one-third of the world’s population (2 billion) has serologic evidence of exposure. HBV coinfection with HCV and HIV is a hidden consequence of the substance use disorder epidemic. Viral populations have extremely high sequence diversity and rapidly evolve, which explains the vaccine failure rates and viral resistance to existing therapies and makes discovering lasting therapies extremely challenging. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is the method of choice to assess the intra-host virus population, termed a “quasispecies”. While a large set of short DNA sequencing reads are acquired that represent the virions in the quasispecies, computational technologies are limited in their analysis capabilities, resulting in particularly low resolution of complex HBV genomic structures. Another challenge is assembling NGS reads representing short fragment of the host genome into full strains (haplotypes) without knowledge of their true occurrence in the samples. To meet these challenges, GATACA is developing pathogen-specific bioinformatics software, GAT-ML (GATACA Assembly Tool – machine learning [ML]) to support treatment discovery and improve infection control. Its specifically designed algorithm utilizes novel ML methodologies adapted and modified for assisting genome assembly that will allow GAT-ML to reconstruct complete viral haplotypes and populations by learning the ‘language’ of the sequences. Tailored initially for HBV samples, GAT and its new ML system will be integrated for feasibility testing in this Phase I with the following Specific Aims: 1. Specific Aim 1. Build a joint learning system. Train and test natural language processing (NLP) methods on HBV genetic variation. 2. Specific Aim 2. Implement and test the machine learning methods in GAT (GAT-ML). We anticipate a working tool for characterizing HBV haplotypes, validated with multi-sourced datasets, and extensive testing and benchmarking of offline and integrated methods. The proposed project will develop and increase the capabilities of our novel computational tool, GAT, to help researchers identify the full spectrum of genetic features of a viral population—such as emergence and persistence of resistance or baseline polymorphisms regardless of their frequencies—and translate these findings to the development of new or improved antiviral drugs and other applications requiring high analytic sensitivity. GAT will particularly benefit researchers working in preclinical stages of drug development who require rapid, sensitive, and reliable results to inform decisions about which targets to advance to clinical trial testing.",Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies,10011686,R43AI152894,"['Adoption', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HIV', 'HIV/HCV', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Infection Control', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Serological', 'Serotyping', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Virion', 'Virus', 'base', 'chronic infection', 'co-infection', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'design', 'drug development', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'neural network', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pre-clinical', 'structural genomics', 'syntax', 'tool', 'viral resistance']",NIAID,"GATACA, LLC",R43,2020,267225,-0.023979896191639805
"POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION,9957109,R01GM117241,"['Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anopheles Genus', 'Anopheles gambiae', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Catalogs', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Link', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mosquito-borne infectious disease', 'Mutation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'deep neural network', 'fight against', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human disease', 'machine learning method', 'malaria infection', 'malaria mosquito', 'malaria transmission', 'markov model', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'resistance allele', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector mosquito']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,295000,-0.0333496708546078
"Computational Methods for Next-Generation GWAS Project Summary/Abstract  Predicting phenotypes from DNA sequence variation is a major goal for genetics with potential applications in evolutionary biology, crop breeding, and public health. A central challenge in this task is separating genetic and environmental effects on phenotypes. In natural populations breeding structure is often correlated with the environment across space such that different subpopulations experience different environments. For genome-wide association studies (GWAS) this creates a problem: genetic and environmental effects can be confounded by population structure, leading to inflated test statistics and low predictive power across populations (Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015, Mathieson and Mcvean, 2012). Understanding when association studies are biased by population stratification and creating better methods to correct for it are thus important challenges for population genetics over the next decade.  To identify conditions under which existing methods of population stratification correction are subject to bias and develop robust new alternatives suitable for use with the continental-scale genomic datasets that are now routinely available for humans, we propose to use simulations and machine learning to separate the signals of fine-scale ancestry from polygenic phenotype association. In our first aim we will develop simulations of polygenic phenotype evolution in continuous space and use the output to evaluate existing methods of stratification control including linear mixed models, PC correction, and LD score regression. In this aim we will seek to identify the regions of parameter space – i.e. the strength of isolation by distance and the spatial distribution of environmental variation – in which existing methods can be expected to produce reliable effect size estimates, and establish guidelines for applications of GWAS to structured populations.  We will then train machine learning algorithms on real genotype data from humans and mosquitoes to describe continuous structure in large spatial samples using a variational autoencoder, a dimensionality reduction technique based on deep neural networks that can take advantage of both allele frequency and haplotype-based measures of differentiation in a single analysis and thus offer improved control of stratification inflation in GWAS relative to the now standard PCA regression approach. Last we will apply deep learning techniques to the problem of linking phenotypes and genotypes in structured samples by training neural networks on simulated phenotypes and empirical genetic data. By training our networks on empirical genetic data and incorporating contextual information about surrounding haplotype structure into the model, our networks should learn to discriminate causal associations from false positives created by population structure in the sample cohort, which will improve performance when attempting to identify associations with the real phenotype. These methods will be applied to existing genomic datasets of height in humans, tested against the current state-of-the-art approaches, and packaged as scalable software for the broader scientific community. Project Narrative Separating the signals of polygenic trait association and population structure has emerged as a major challenge for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We propose to develop new simulations of populations evolving in continuous space that will allow us to rigorously benchmark existing methods of stratification control in GWAS while fully controlling the underlying demographic and selective process. We will then apply deep learning techniques to develop (1) a new method of dimensionality reduction to test as a covariate for ancestry in GWAS, and (2) a neural network that identifies genotype-phenotype connections while controlling for population structure in the sample cohort.",Computational Methods for Next-Generation GWAS,9910009,F32GM136123,"['Agriculture', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Height', 'Human', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oligogenic Traits', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Variant', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'large scale simulation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'polygenic risk score', 'population stratification', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F32,2020,19290,-0.005368158414604768
"Center for Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation Genomic data hold the promise of revolutionizing our understanding and treatment of human disease. Multiple barriers stand between the acquisition of the data and realizing these and other benefits. Rapid accumulation of genomic data far exceeds our capacity to reliably interpret genomic variation. New developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, combined with increased computing power and domain knowledge, provide hope for the deployment of enhanced computational tools in both basic research and clinical practice. Use of these methods critically depends upon reliable characterization of their performance.  The Center for Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (C-CAGI) will address these needs, through objective evaluation of the state of the art in relating human genetic variation and health. CAGI has had five editions since 2010 with 50 challenges posed to the community taken on by hundreds of predictors, leading to scores of publications about prediction methods and their assessment. We propose for C-CAGI to continue to advance the field of variant interpretation through the following Specific Aims: 1. Develop community experiments to evaluate the quality of computational methods for interpreting genomic variation data. C-CAGI will conduct community experiments in which participants make bona fide blinded predictions of disease related phenotypes on the basis of genomic data. We will engage a diverse predictor community to spur innovation. The CAGI Ethics Forum will vet studies to ensure that privacy and sharing maintain the highest standards and will educate the community. 2. Assess the quality of current computational methods for interpreting genomic variation data; highlight innovations and progress at interactive conferences. Predictions will be evaluated by independent assessors, who will be supported by new assessment approaches from C-CAGI. Results will be presented at CAGI experiment conferences with deep technical engagement, which will be interleaved with reflective CAGIâ meetings that create an environment for a comprehensive evaluation of the field, facilitating identification of major bottlenecks and problems faced by the current genome interpretation approaches. 3. Broadly disseminate the results and conclusions from the CAGI experiments and analysis. C-CAGI will outreach to the broader scientific and clinical community through its publications, and the creation of a calibrated reference integrated into the most common workflows for ready adoption. CAGI will also be represented at international meetings with presentations and workshops. 4. Operate effectively and responsively. C-CAGI will operate efficiently as it closely interacts with hundreds of participants. CAGI will build upon a robust information infrastructure that securely facilitates data dissemination, prediction submission, and assessment. Genomic variation is responsible for numerous rare diseases, for propensity for many common traits and diseases, for drug response, and is a key characteristic of cancer evolution. At present, our ability to characterize genetic differences far exceeds our capacity to interpret them either for basic research understanding or for clinical application.

"Deep learning approaches to decipher the impact of mobile element insertion on alternative splicing in neurological disorders The purpose of this training and research application is to study the functional impact of mobile element insertions (MEIs) in neurological disorders (NDs) using new developments in deep learning techniques. MEIs are transposable DNA fragments that are able to insert throughout the human genome. There are at least 124 independent MEIs associated with human diseases. Approximately 20% of these diseases represent a spectrum of NDs, yet the overall contribute of MEIs to the etiology of NDs has not been systematically estimated. To address this, we will (1) characterize functional MEIs in GTEx cohorts in healthy individuals; (2) build a comprehensive functional map of MEIs to determine tissue-specific and brain-specific impact; and (3) impute transcriptional changes on various NDs where whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data will be generated. The proposed application will also develop an extensive research program for Dr. Dadi Gao, a computational biologist and statistical geneticist who has trained in functional genomic studies of alternative splicing in neurodegenerative disorders and therapeutic targeting of a splicing defect that causes a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. He has developed novel methods to investigate regulation of the transcriptome and to facilitate analyses in drug development. He now seeks to expand his expertise by applying statistical and deep learning models on large cohorts of sequencing data from controls and cases with NDs from post-mortem tissues, then impute functional consequences of MEIs from WGS in large-scale disease cohorts. The training plan consists of two years of mentored research to learn new skills in genome analysis, MEI characterization, and advanced deep learning techniques, followed by three years of shaping an independent laboratory. The research plan is developed to comprehensively explore functional variation in the genome by decomposing transcriptomic changes against MEIs. Dr. Michael Talkowski at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard, and the Broad Institute will serve as the primary mentor, while Dr. Manolis Kellis at MIT and the MIT Computational Biology Group, and the Broad Institute will serve as a co-mentor and close collaborator. These mentors are recognized experts in genomic structural variants, functional genomics, the genetics of neurological disorders, and computational modeling to establish functional elements in the human genome. In addition, a team of independent investigators from basic and translational research will provide Dr. Gao with comprehensive feedback to keep both his science and career development on track. The highly collaborative environment in CGM, MGH, Harvard Medical School, the Broad Institute and the University of Michigan Medical School will prepare Dr. Gao for his transition to an independent investigator. This outstanding mentorship team and training program will facilitate the career development of Dr. Gao as he seeks to redefine the functional maps of MEIs in the human genome and to impute their impact in large-scale neurological disorders. Mobile element insertions (MEIs) represent a largely undefined component of the genetic architecture of neurological disorders, as a number of MEIs have been associated with alternative splicing in these disorders but large-scale genome-wide functional characterization has not been systematically performed across tissues. This program study will functionally characterize the impact of MEIs on alternative splicing from whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing in large cohorts using new developments in deep learning models. These results will enhance our understanding of the etiological role and pathogenic mechanisms associated with MEIs in neuronal development and human neurological disorders.",Deep learning approaches to decipher the impact of mobile element insertion on alternative splicing in neurological disorders,10041366,K99NS118109,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autopsy', 'Basic Science', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dorsal', 'Dystonia', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Excision Repair', 'Familial Dysautonomia', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Filipino', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Haplotypes', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Introns', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mind', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mosaicism', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retroelements', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'TAF1 gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Tissue-Specific Splicing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcription Alteration', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'career development', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'functional genomics', 'functional outcomes', 'gene function', 'genetic architecture', 'genome analysis', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mind control', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2020,91226,-0.015302103268949348
"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns,10022173,K23NS110927,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Archives', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Physiology', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lobar', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'arteriole', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain parenchyma', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypertension control', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'risk variant', 'serial imaging', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,178809,-0.007373373866966872
"Inferring selection from human population genomic data Project Summary/Abstract Identifying genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation is a major challenge in population genetics. Particularly in humans, the task of confidently detecting the action of recent adaptive natural selection (or positive selection) has proved troublesome. Indeed there is considerable controversy over whether recent positive selection has a substantial impact on human genetic variation. The work proposed here will address this problem by creating a more complete map of positive selection across many human populations, identifying selection on de novo mutations as well as selection on previously standing variation.  Specifically, the proposed research seeks to construct a scan for positives election that is more robust and accurate than any currently existing methods (Aim 1). This tool will utilize supervised machine learning techniques allowing it combine information from a number of existing tests for natural selection, and will be tested extensively on a large suite of population genetic simulations presenting a wide range of potentially confounding scenarios. This tool will then be released to the public. Next, it will be applied to 26 human populations in which a large sample of genomes have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project (Aim 2), revealing similarities and differences in the tempo, mode, and targets of adaptive evolution across human populations. Finally, because selection on both beneficial and deleterious mutations skews genetic variation, our method will be used to identify regions of the genome least affected by natural selection, which will in turn be used to produce more accurate inferences of human demographic histories (Aim 3).  The mentored phase of this work will be performed within the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University. This is an intellectually stimulating environment with numerous journal clubs, an excellent seminar series, and several other research groups using computational techniques. The project will be performed under the stewardship of Dr. Andrew Kern, from whom the candidate will also receive training in machine learning and population genetics. Dr. Schrider will also receive training in population genetics and guidance from Dr. Jody Hey (Co-mentor) at nearby Temple University. This training will help Dr. Schrider acquire skills that will aid not only in the completion of the proposed work but also his transition to principle investigator of an internationally recognized independent research program studying the evolutionary forces driving patterns of human genetic variation. Project Narrative Detecting genes underpinning recent human adaptation remains a major challenge, and such genes are often associated with human disease. The work proposed here seeks to use supervised machine learning techniques to detect genomic regions responsible for recent adaptation across 26 different human populations. This work will also clarify human population size and migration histories, information that has implications for the prevalence of disease-causing mutations and efforts to identify them.",Inferring selection from human population genomic data,9868315,R00HG008696,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homo sapiens', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'International', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'de novo mutation', 'disease-causing mutation', 'driving force', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human population genetics', 'machine learning method', 'population migration', 'pressure', 'programs', 'sample fixation', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R00,2020,237600,0.0146522470696343
"Conceptualizing Actionability in Clinical Genomic Screening Project Summary/Abstract. Clinical genomic sequencing (CGS) produces large amounts of data, much of which is hard to characterize or may have a negligible influence on health. The concept of actionability is commonly used to help separate information that may be useful from information that is likely irrelevant for patients. Actionability directs attention to whether genomic information warrants action and reflects its initial development as a strategy to augment diagnosis and treatment in sick patients. As CGS expands towards healthy populations in primary care settings, actionability is still widely embraced despite little consensus regarding its definition and use. Because this ambiguity could become an obstacle to the successful implementation of clinical genomic sequencing in healthy populations, greater clarity about this concept is necessary. The proposed research will fulfill this need by characterizing the emergence and varied meanings of actionability in clinical genomics, focusing on clinical genomics' transition into primary care settings. By identifying underlying values and assumptions related to actionability, this research will push beyond definitional disputes and provide a deeper framework for assessing how genetic information is valued. The specific aims are: 1. Identify and characterize, through in-depth interviews, how genomics experts and primary care providers conceptualize what makes genomic information actionable for healthy populations. 2. Identify and characterize, through a natural language processing (NLP) analysis of published literature, how the concept of actionability emerged, spread, and is used throughout clinical genomics. 3. Convene a workshop with genomics experts, primary care providers, and ELSI scholars to produce a white paper on actionability and the ethical, effective integration of CGS into primary care, guided by the results from Aims 1 and 2. This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award includes a highly-structured, mentored training program that will support the candidate's goal to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI investigator focused on assessing the value of genomic information. To achieve this career goal, the candidate will: 1. Receive training in genetic and genomic science to facilitate collaboration with genomics care teams and make scientifically accurate policy recommendations 2. Build new methodological skills in biomedical informatics and natural language processing to conduct generalizable research 3. Publish and engage with scientific and medical audiences to have a more direct impact on future guidelines and policies. 4. Develop a collaborative and interdisciplinary research network. This training will include coursework, guided readings, network building, and sustained mentorship by a highly-qualified team of faculty with expertise in ELSI research, bioethics, clinical genomics, biomedical informatics, and the history and sociology of medicine. This training will prepare the candidate to transition to an independent ELSI investigator focused on ethical issues related to the actionability of genomic health information – an ELSI research priority in Genetic and Genomic Healthcare.

This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award will prepare the candidate to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI researcher pursing a research program on ethical issues related to the actionability of genomic information.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,9886261,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Community Medicine', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'data preservation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,371859,-0.0002103194942240358
"Advancing Multi-Omics and Electronic Health Records Computational Methodologies PROJECT SUMMARY  Phenomic advances from large-scale electronic health records (EHR) linked to DNA biobanks have pioneered an efficient approach to genetic discovery that has transformed human genetic studies, with the enormous potential to provide constraints on relevant biological mechanisms on a wide spectrum of human phenotypes. Nevertheless, our understanding of the downstream molecular consequences of genetic associations remains limited and impedes our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases. Given their enormous discovery potential for human genomics and precision medicine, genetic analyses in diverse populations offer unprecedented opportunities to identify causal genetic mechanisms underlying human trait variation.  This research proposal aims to address these convergent developments and critical gaps and to exert a powerful influence on efforts to expand our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Here we hypothesize that a comprehensive multi- omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology will provide a robust and rigorous framework. This proposal thus has the following aims: AIM 1: Develop a regularized regression based methodology and a deep learning framework to improve characterization of the genetic architecture of gene expression and to build robust prediction models, extending a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methodology (called PrediXcan) that we developed. AIM 2: Develop statistical causal modeling of trait-associated genetic variation through a convergent TWAS and Mendelian Randomization approach and apply it to thousands of human traits with available GWAS and EHR data. AIM 3: Develop analytic approaches and software tools to further genetic analyses in admixed and multi-ethnic populations and to lay the groundwork for trans-ethnic multi-omic methodologies, using EHR data (e.g., BioVU, UK Biobank, All of Us). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE We will develop a comprehensive multi-omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology that bridges the gap between Genetic Epidemiology and Functional Genomics.

"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,9925808,R01LM012895,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,399965,0.0075533424345318005
"Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa Project Summary/Abstract Background: A major challenge in evolutionary genomics is to characterize the forces shaping present-day patterns of genetic variation. For instance, the extent and manner in which natural selection affects genetic diversity remains highly controversial. Researchers have largely addressed this problem by developing statistical tests or summaries of genome sequence variation that provide insights into the evolutionary forces at play. However, because such approaches typically rely on a single univariate summary of the data, valuable discriminatory information present in the original dataset is lost. A more fruitful strategy would thus be to use multidimensional summaries of genomic data (e.g. a large vector of summary statistics) or even the totality of the input data (e.g. a matrix-representation of a sequence alignment) to make more accurate inferences. An even more powerful approach is to utilize data sets in which the same population is sampled at multiple time points, allowing one to observe evolutionary dynamics in action. Although such genomic time-series data are becoming more prevalent, the development of appropriate computational methodologies has lagged behind the proliferation of such data. Proposal: The Schrider Lab seeks to develop and apply powerful machine learning methods for evolutionary inference. Our work over the next five years will yield powerful software tools leveraging novel representations of genomic datasets, including time-series data. These efforts will dramatically improve researchers' ability to make accurate evolutionary inferences from both population genomic and phylogenetic data. Indeed, preliminary results demonstrate that our methods vastly outperform current approaches in evolutionary genetics. More importantly, we will use these tools to answer pressing evolutionary questions. In particular, our use of time-series data will reveal loci responsible for recent adaptation with much greater confidence than currently possible. Our efforts will help to resolve the controversy over the role of adaptation in shaping patterns of diversity across the human genome. This research has important implications for public health as well, as genes underlying recent adaptations are enriched for disease-associations. Moreover, we are constructing a time-series dataset in the mosquito vector species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We will interrogate these data for evidence of recent and ongoing adaptation—this work will reveal loci responsible for the evolution of resistance to insecticides and other control efforts. Encouraging preliminary data also suggest that our work in phylogenetics will substantially improve inferential power in this important research area. More broadly, the success of the novel approaches described in this proposal has the potential to transform the methodological landscape of evolutionary genomic data analysis. Project Narrative The work proposed here seeks to develop and apply powerful machine-learning based software tools for evolutionary genetic inference in humans, mosquito vectors, and other species. Such efforts have important health implications, as they can identify genes involved in adaptation, which in humans are often associated with disease and in mosquitos are often associated with resistance to insecticides and other control efforts.",Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa,10028474,R35GM138286,"['Address', 'Aedes', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Insecticides', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'statistics', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'vector', 'vector mosquito']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2020,382894,0.019079659714784442
"Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic PROJECT SUMMARY We are in the midst of a genomic revolution; more than 250,000 human genomes have been sequenced, generating over a petabase of genomic data. While these new data hold great promise to impact health, there is a disconnect between genomic discovery and clinical care. Providers frequently misinterpret genomic information, patients often don't understand their own test results, and genomic information about disease risk is infrequently shared between patients and family members. Importantly, ineffective communication and data misinterpretation has devastating consequences- including unnecessary organ removal, missed disease prevention opportunities, and premature death. We are addressing these genomic care gaps by developing and testing tools that optimize the integration of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES, WGS) for general clinical practice. My vision for improving genomic medicine is based on my work within multidisciplinary consortia and addresses the National Human Genome Research Institute's priority research area of improving the effectiveness of healthcare. In the proposed work we will test the effectiveness of a multilevel genomic e-Health intervention in cancer (Aim 1). Our intervention 1) educates physicians and patients about genomics, 2) enables direct-to-patient return-of- results, 3) provides physicians with patient-specific results and resources for interpretation, and 4) facilitates sharing of genomic results within families. We hypothesize that intervention use will result in higher rates of uptake of high-quality, genetically guided care. We will test our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial among academic and community physicians who use WES for their patients. Next, we will use an iterative process, with stakeholder engagement, to adapt and pilot test our tool for Spanish and Mandarin speaking patients and for patients who have diabetes (Aim 2). Finally, we will create and assess new, moderated, social networks as a platform for genomic information sharing (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that providers, patients and family members will engage with the genomic information sharing social networks and find them to be highly useful. Our general approach includes 1) creating the secure social networks, 2) integrating the networks into our e-Health intervention, and 3) using complementary methods, such as interviews and natural language processing, to assess stakeholders' network-related attitudes and network information quality. If successful, we will be well positioned to widely disseminate our e-Health tools. In sum, this work stands to transform how people obtain, process and share genomic information in the context of clinical care. Our tools reconceive genetic communication to allow for multi-directional flow of information, connects multiple stakeholders with one another, and integrates high-quality dynamic web-based resources to improve genomic care. In creating and deploying tools that both respond to and leverage the complexities of our information environment, we intend to transform genomic research and clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ RELEVANCE OF PROJECT TO RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH Widespread utilization of genomic sequencing in medicine creates an urgent need to educate providers and patients. Currently, providers frequently misinterpret genomic information and patients often don't understand their own test results. In order to address this critical need, we propose to design and test multiple e-Health communication tools that will help providers and patients to better understand genomic data, lead to higher quality patient care, and facilitate genomic information sharing within families.",Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic,10003373,R35HG010721,"['Address', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Community Physician', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Social Network', 'Sum', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness testing', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'online resource', 'premature', 'tool', 'uptake', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,R35,2020,540906,0.005595764513038977
"Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) Project Summary/Abstract  The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have enabled the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of disease phenotypes, at the tissue and even the single cell level. This has allowed development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients. Thus, new genomic science educational initiatives need to be continually updated to educate the clinical and translational workforce on how to effectively interpret and apply the findings from genomics studies. Patients of providers who have participated in these educational initiatives also benefit as it allows for more rapid integration of genomic study findings into the clinical care setting. Thus, in response to PAR-19-185, we propose to develop and implement the Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) program that will not only focus on the analysis of genomic data, but also on gene-expression data, the integration of these two data types, as well as introductory theory and application of statistical and machine learning methods. Specifically we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Develop and successfully implement the online and in-person phases of CREiGS to increase the methodologic ingenuity by which researchers tackle important genomics-related clinical problems. 2. Establish a Diversity Recruitment External Advisory Board to ensure that the most effective strategies are employed to recruit URM doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from academic institutions nationwide into CREiGS. 3. Enhance the dissemination phase of CREiGS by packaging and uploading the asynchronous lectures and the online critical thinking/problem solving assessments with solutions for publicly available, online teaching resources. 4. Implement effective methods to evaluate the efficacy of CREiGS by examining:1) the participants' grasp of the CREiGS core competencies, 2) the clarity and quality of the curriculum, 3) program logistics and operation, and 4) the participants' short-term and long-term success attributed to participation in CREiGS. In summary, we posit that CREiGS will provide participants with a solid foundation in genomics science to answer complex, clinical questions. We believe that CREiGS supports the mission of the NHGRI by providing researchers with rigorous training to “accelerate medical breakthroughs that improve human health.” Project Narrative The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have allowed for the development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients.

"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award.

"Leveraging Common Fund data for feature selection in Kids First studies. Project Abstract This project will pilot a process for identifying multi-variant interactions contributing structural birth defect and childhood cancer disorders. This study will focus on analysis of oral-facial clefts, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and congenital heart defects from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from family cohorts taken from Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project (KF).  Typically, tests to link disorders to genome-wide complex multivariate associations are computationally prohibitive. Thus, a first step to making such analyses more reasonable is to limit the number of variables (genes, variants) being tested together. We can reduce the number of possible tests by restricting what data should be tested. This study will seek to reduce the data for testing by utilizing biological knowledge from other two Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. KOMP2 has generated extensive information on mouse knockout developmental phenotypes relevant for matching gene and phenotypes in KF WGS studies. GTEx can be merged with KF loci and relevant tissue-to-phenotype relationships. Thus, using features from other Common Fund data and annotations, we can generate selected subsets of KF variants and genes as feature-reduced KF data.  A comprehensive machine learning (ML) analysis pipeline will then be utilized for the identification of candidate risk factors and characterization of complex patterns of association between these feature-reduced KF data. In addition to performing the more traditional univariate association analyses of genotype vs. phenotype, this pipeline will also identify complex associations including (1) context-dependent genetic effects resulting from non-additive multi-variant interactions, i.e. epistasis, and (2) subgroup-specific associations, i.e. by phenotype and genotypic heterogeneity, where different etiological paths lead to the same/similar phenotypes in the selected KF subject group. This pipeline will include feature selection, modeling, and interpretation of multi-variant interactions.  The outcomes of this study will include (1) pipelines for integrating Common Fund data into Kids First datasets, (2) integrated KF-KOMP2-GTEx datasets including cross-species integration, (3) ML pipelines for multi-variant interaction analyses of phenotype vs genotype in selected, reduced-feature KF data, and (4) results from the aforementioned pipelines for multi-variant interactions for later hypothesis testing. Project Abstract This project will pilot a process for identifying interactions between genetic variants that contribute to structural birth defect and childhood cancer disorders by combining data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project with biological knowledge from other two Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.

"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed understanding of admixture is essential for effective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on phenotype are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simplified models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This proposal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to leverage this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate powerful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as effectively as homogeneous populations. The first step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statistical framework to infer fine-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop effective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major impact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to efficiently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human phenotypes, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on fine-scale genomic structure and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can benefit from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,9990809,R35GM125055,"['Admixture', 'Alleles', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic evolution', 'insight', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structural genomics', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2020,332952,0.032280626974499495
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9916801,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'diverse data', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,341471,-0.026860301066440186
"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9870944,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contig', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2020,397125,0.0004229558486235557
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9893003,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2020,336445,0.0049477686964276525
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9927686,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,340025,0.0007864044326186342
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9889183,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data fusion', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,698402,-0.0014754302590246102
"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics.

"Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data Project Summary This project develops novel statistical inference procedures for biomedical big data (BBD), including data from diverse omics platforms, various medical imaging technologies and electronic health records. Statistical inference, i.e., assess- ing uncertainty, statistical signiﬁcance and conﬁdence, is a key step in computational pipelines that aim to discover new disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments using BBD. However, the development of statistical inference procedures for BBD has lagged behind technological advances. In fact, while point estimation and variable selection procedures for BBD have matured over the past two decades, existing inference procedures are either limited to simple methods for marginal inference and/or lack the ability to integrate biomedical data across multiple studies and plat- forms. This paucity is, in large part, due to the challenges of statistical inference in high-dimensional models, where the number of features is considerably larger than the number of subjects in the study. Motivated by our team's extensive and complementary expertise in analyzing multi-omics data from heterogenous studies, including the TOPMed project on which multiple team members currently collaborate, the current proposal aims to address these challenges. The ﬁrst aim of the project develops a novel inference procedure for conditional parameters in high-dimensional models based on dimension reduction, which facilitates seamless integration of external biological information, as well as biomedical data across multiple studies and platforms. To expand the application of this method to very high-dimensional models that arise in BBD applications, the second aim develops a data-adaptive screening procedure for selecting an optimal subset of relevant variables. The third aim develops a novel inference procedure for high-dimensional mixed linear models. This method expands the application domain of high-dimensional inference procedures to studies with longitu- dinal data and repeated measures, which arise commonly in biomedical applications. The fourth aim develops a novel data-driven procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which facilitates the integration of evidence from multiple BBD sources, while minimizing the false negative rate (FNR) for optimal discovery. Upon evaluation using ex- tensive simulation experiments and application to multi-omics data from the TOPMed project, the last aim implements the proposed methods into easy-to-use open-source software tools leveraging the R programming language and the capabilities of the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments for BBD methods and tools. Public Health Relevance Biomedical big data (BBD), including large collections of omics data, medical imaging data, and electronic health records, offer unprecedented opportunities for discovering disease mechanisms and developing effective treatments. However, despite their tremendous potential, discovery using BBD has been hindered by computational challenges, including limited advances in statistical inference procedures that allow biomedical researchers to investigate uncon- founded associations among biomarkers of interest and various biological phenotypes, while integrating data from multiple BBD sources. The current proposal bridges this gap by developing novel statistical machine learning methods and easy-to-use open-source software for statistical inference in BBD, which are designed to facilitate the integration of data from multiple studies and platforms.",Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data,9969887,R01GM133848,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Galaxy', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'R programming language ', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'computational pipelines', 'data integration', 'design', 'diverse data', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,456980,-0.011678492031729791
"Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data Rapid progress in translational bioinformatics and clinical informatics for precision medicine has  provided many computing and informatics methodologies to provide better prediction, diagnosis and  treatment strategy as a clinical utility. In particular, high dimensional and large-scale  biomedical data sets, ranging from clinical data to ‘omics data, provide an unprecedented  opportunity for translating the newly found knowledge from biomedical big data analytics to  support clinical decisions. The complexity and scale of these big data sets hold great  promise, yet present substantial challenges. As one of important concerns for clinicians,  comorbidity is a well- documented phenomenon in medicine in which one or more medical conditions  exist and potentially interact with one another, thereby influencing the primary clinical  condition. Several studies show variability in the number of comorbid conditions that can  exist at one time, and patterns of disease presentation differ from one chronic condition to  another. Thus, there is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple  comorbidities, but doing so requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease  associations than we currently possess. Previous studies have primarily focused on a  handful of specific comorbidities; investigating the underlying causes of broad disease  comorbidity across the human diseasome has been challenging. Fortunately, in the past  decade, comprehensive collections of disease diagnosis data have become available, primarily  in the form of data from electronic health records (EHRs). Retrospectively, we can use a patient’s  health history to identify comorbidities and apply a data-driven approach to studying disease  comorbidity patterns that considers all possible disease comorbidities. In particular, developing  computing and modeling of large-scale data that integrates newly defined comorbidity patterns with  genomics will hold great potential for uncovering molecular mechanisms of disease. Primarily, we  will elucidate the underlying genetic and non-genetic factors that influence disease comorbidity.  We will apply two orthogonal approaches to identify comorbidities: 1) deriving from disease  co-occurrence using EHR data alone, and 2) deriving from pleiotropic genetic associations using the  EHR-linked biobank dataset. Network-based approaches have the potential to uncover unexpected  relationships between diseases. One of the most significant advantages of our proposal is the  linking of a single-source EHR to genomic data; this provides the opportunity to  revisit individual-level genotype and phenotype data for the design of more targeted  studies and to ask more specific questions. Additionally, our results can be used to develop  a novel comorbidity risk score that combines both clinical data and genetic effects, which might  constitute a new tool for clinical prevention and monitoring. These goals are very much in keeping  with today’s climate of precision medicine, where treatment and prevention are ideally designed to  consider an individual patient’s variability in genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. There is a clear need to improve care for individuals with multiple comorbidities, but this  requires a much more detailed understanding of the trends of disease associations than we  currently possess. An EHR-linked biobank data provides a unique opportunity to investigate  cross-phenotypes associations, and it might broaden the understanding of genetic architecture  that exists between diagnoses, genes, and pleiotropy. In this proposal, we will construct a  disease comorbidity map of 2.1 million patients using longitudinal EHRs in Penn Medicine (Aim 1),  construct a disease-gene map derived from phenome-wide association study using Penn Medicine  Biobank Participants (Aim 2), and develop a novel scoring system using graph-based  machine learning and predict comorbidity risk scores (CRS) for a given disease (Aim 3).",Unravelling genetic basis of comorbidity using EHR-linked biobank data,10034691,R01GM138597,"['Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Source', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'electronic data', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interactive tool', 'large scale data', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'patient variability', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trend']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,486125,0.0022122298223409774
"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9962426,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'multiple data types', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,323659,-0.014198521806819265
"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,9982627,RM1HG009034,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All of Us Research Program', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'CCL4 gene', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Conceptions', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Protection', 'Data Security', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'European Union', 'Family', 'Film', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Identity', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Privacy', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newspapers', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral economics', 'blockchain', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'data access', 'data privacy', 'data sharing', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genomic data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'legal implication', 'minimal risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'news', 'next generation', 'sex', 'social', 'social media']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2020,1112351,-0.008445484198242205
"Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement Project Summary/Abstract The mandate of the PsychENCODE Data Analysis Core (DAC) includes the development of novel integrative methodologies to construct a coherent interpretational framework for the data emerging from the consortium. The complexity of building such a framework lies in the diversity of experimental assays and their associated confounding factors, as well as in the inherent uncertainty regarding how the various target biological components function together. As a result, any analytical and computational methods would need to capture this high dimensionality of structure in the data. While classical, parallel computation advances at an incredible pace and continues to serve the needs of the research community, our experience with the ever- increasing complexity of neuropsychiatric datasets has motivated us to also look at other promising technological avenues. Accordingly, motivated by recent developments in the field of quantum computing (QC), we herein explore the use of QC algorithms as applied to two problems of relevance to the PsychENCODE DAC: (1) the prediction of brain-specific enhancers based on variants and functional genomic assays (Aim S1; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant); and (2) the calculation of the contributions of cell types to tissue-level gene expression and to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder (Aim S2; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant). The nascency of QC hardware technologies and the complexity of simulating quantum algorithms on classical computing resources means that our exploration will be confined to smaller, judiciously chosen datasets.Nevertheless, the work in this supplement will serve to evaluate future prospects for the use of QC algorithms and hardware in genomic analyses. We also consider two different paradigms of QC, the quantum annealer and the quantum gate model, and weigh their efficiency relative to classical computing. Finally, we will incorporate the QC and classical predictions into PsychENCODE consortium's database and online portal for visualizing the relationships between different genetic and genomic elements, and evaluate corroborating evidence for the predictions (Aim S3; related to Aim 2 of the parent grant). Project Narrative The PsychENCODE consortium has conducted extensive functional genomic analyses of samples from individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders aim to discover the complex biological architecture that lead from genetic and epigenetic markers of disease to the observed phenotypes. To reveal this underlying structure, the consortium relies on the use of sophisticated computational methods, including machine learning techniques, implemented on cutting-edge massively parallel computing resources by the consrtium’s Data Analysis Core (DAC). However, the scale and complexity of the tasks place significant burdens on these resources, and suggest the need for exploring alternative computing hardware technologies. This supplement to the DAC parent grant evaluates the promise of the emerging field of quantum computing to speed up large-scale computations and more efficiently explore the model landscape, using a comparative analysis of classical and quantum computing algorithms applied to problems relevant to the PsychENCODE DAC: the annotation of brain-specific enhancers and the quantification of cell-type contributions to bulk tissue gene expression.",Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement,10047746,U01MH116492,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computing resources', 'data framework', 'design', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high dimensionality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'parent grant', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'quantum computing', 'simulation', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2020,195697,-0.00484603998808046
"Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation Project Summary/Abstract: With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the breadth and depth of different omics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of individuals in genomic data science. Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices. Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects, such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Project Narrative: Sharing large-scale functional genomics data is critical for scientific discovery, but comes with important privacy concerns related to the possible misuse of such data. This proposal will quantify and manage the rieslkasted to releasing functional genomics datasets, based on integrating inferred genotypes from the raw sequence files, signal tracks, and microbiome mapped sequences. Finally, we will develop file formats, statistical methodologies, and related software for anonymization of functional genomics data that enable open sharing.",Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation,9970939,R01HG010749,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glean', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'open data', 'privacy preservation', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,523409,-0.007244425616923795
"Estimating Mediation Effects in Prevention Studies The purpose of this competing continuation grant proposal is to develop, evaluate and apply  methodological and statistical procedures to investigate how prevention programs change outcome  variables. These mediation analyses assess the link between program effects on the constructs targeted  by a prevention program and effects on the outcome. As noted by many researchers and federal  agencies, mediation analyses identify the most effective program components and increase  understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to changing outcome variables. Information from  mediation analysis can make interventions more powerful, more efficient, and shorter. The P. I. of this grant received a one-year NIDA small grant and four multi-year grants to develop and evaluate mediation  analysis in prevention research. This work led to many publications and innovations. The proposed  five-year continuation focuses on the further development and refinement of exciting new mediation  analysis statistical developments. Four statistical topics represent next steps in this research and include  analytical and simulation research as well as applications to etiological and prevention data. The work expands on our development of causal mediation and Bayesian mediation methods that hold great promise for mediation analysis. In Study 1, practical causal mediation and Bayesian mediation analyses  for research designs are developed and evaluated. This approach will clarify methods and develop  approaches for dealing with violation of testable and untestable assumptions. Study 2 investigates  important measurement issues for the investigation of mediation. This work will focus on methods to identify critical facets of mediating variables, approaches to understanding whether mediators and  outcomes are redundant, and develop methods for studies with big data. Study 3 continues the development and evaluation of new longitudinal mediation methods for ecological momentary assessment data and other studies with massive data collection. These new methods promise to more accurately model change over time for both individuals and groups of individuals. Study 4 develops methods to  uncover subgroups in mediation analysis including causal mediation methods, multilevel models, and new  approaches based on residuals for identifying individuals for whom mediating processes differ in  effectiveness from other individuals. For each study, we will investigate unique issues with mediation analysis of prevention data including methods for small N and also massive data collection (big data), the RcErLitEicVaANl rCoEle(Soeef imnsetruacstiounrse):ment for mediating mechanisms, and the application of the growing literature on  causal methods and Bayesian methods.

"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community. The proposed work will advance the ﬁeld of statistical genomics and facilitate trans-omics precision medicine studies of chronic diseases.

"Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores PROJECT SUMMARY The key appeal of polygenic risk scores (PRS) is the provision of individual-level estimates of genetic liability to complex disease. These proxies of genetic liability enable a raft of applications across clinical and basic research settings. However, while PRS are set to play a pivotal role in the future of biomedical research, their present formulation is suboptimal since it fails to directly account for substructure in genetic disease risk. The overarching goal of our proposal is to introduce a new generation of pathway-specific PRS, informed by biological function. Rather a single genome-wide PRS for each individual, they will have a set of k PRS over k pathways. Pathways will be defined according to multiscale integration of ‘omics data, exploiting co-expression networks, the transcriptome and the epigenome. The key deliverable from this project will be the production of a powerful and comprehensive pathway-specific PRS computational tool, PRSet, informed by biological function. The rationale is that PRS calculated for individuals by aggregating the effects of all risk variants genome-wide, results in a loss of vital individual-level information. Providing pathway-specific estimates of genetic liability, computed in a scalable, statistically rigorous way, informed by latest multi-omic data, could enable researchers to better decompose heterogenous complex disease, identify key pathways that explain overlap or differences among disorders, and explain problems of portability of PRS between and within populations. Applying our pathway-specific PRS tool, we seek to stratify patients into more homogenous subgroups by their liability over key pathways. We will use PRSet for stratification in three ways: (i) stratifying within SCZ/BiP, testing if liability over different pathways forms multiple routes to disease, (ii) differentiating between SCZ and BiP, testing if key pathways differentiate these highly overlapping disorders, (iii) testing whether variation in treatment response can be explained by pathway liability. Such stratification could help explain past successes, failures and adverse-effects in clinical trials, and provide new therapeutic targets tailored to subsets of patients. Our proposal is significant because the burgeoning application of PRS means that any advance in the PRS approach will have immediate, high impact across psychiatric research. Pathway-specific PRS could open-up routes to hypotheses that cannot be answered by genome-wide PRS. If PRSet reveals that genetic liability is more stratified than presently modelled, then this would call for a focus on pathways and their multi-omic integration, paving a new path towards precision medicine. Our proposal is innovative because we develop the first pathway-specific, function-informed, PRS tool, we propose that disease risk may be influenced by multiple genetic liabilities, and we stratify patients according to pathway-specific genetic risk for the first time. In conclusion, our proposal delivers a tool for the field to perform powerful pathway PRS analyses, better understand genetic liability to disease, and which may offer a more direct route to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are set to play a key role in advancing our understanding of the etiology and treatment of disease. While the application of genome-wide PRS is burgeoning across biomedical research, we propose that pathway-specific PRS have even greater potential to provide etiological insights and will help pave the way to precision medicine.

However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9989904,U01MH115727,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2020,4125261,-0.0022305078326653846
"Privacy-preserving genomic medicine at scale 1 Project Summary  2  3 High-throughput sequencing, biomedical imaging, and electronic health record technologies are 4 generating health-related datasets of unprecedented scale. Integrative analysis of these  5 resources promises to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. Yet, the  6 sensitive nature of these data often requires that they be kept in isolated silos, limiting their 7 usefulness to science. The goal of this project is to develop innovative privacy-preserving  8 algorithms to enable data sharing and drive genomic medicine. Crucially, we will draw upon our  9 past success in secure genome analysis and algorithmic expertise in computational biology to 10 address the imminent need to perform complex integrative analyses securely and at scale. 11 Current privacy-preserving tools are prohibitively too costly to perform the complex 12 calculations required in genomic analysis. We previously leveraged the highly structured nature 13 of biological data and novel optimization strategies to implement efficient pipelines for secure 14 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and drug interaction predictions which scaled to 15 millions of samples. In this project, we will further exploit the unique properties of biomedical data 16 to: (i) develop secure integrative analysis methods for genomic medicine; (ii) develop an easy-to- 17 use programming environment with advanced automated optimizations to facilitate the adoption 18 of privacy-preserving analyses; and (iii) promote the use of our privacy techniques to gain novel 19 biological insights through large-scale collaborative genetic studies of multi-ethnic cohorts. 20 With co-I’s Amarasinghe (MIT) and Cho (Broad Institute), we aim to apply these tools to 21 realize the first multi-institution, multi-national secure genetic studies with our partners at the 22 Swiss Personalized Health Network, UK Biobank, Finnish FinnGen, All of Us, NIH NCBI, Broad 23 and Barcelona Supercomputing Center (Letters of Support). We will also use our privacy- 24 preserving approaches to study genomic origins of polygenic traits for disease as well as 25 neuroimaging and other clinical phenotypes. We will continue to actively integrate our methods 26 into community standards (MPEG-G, GA4GH). 27 Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods and open-source, 28 easy-to-use, production-grade implementations that open the door to secure integration and 29 analysis of massive sets of sensitive genomic and clinical data. With input from our collaborations, 30 we will build these tools and apply them to better understand the molecular causes of human 31 health and its translation to the clinic. Project Narrative Combining genomic and health-related data from millions of patients will empower the development of clinically relevant measures of human health and disease risks. However, this task requires securely sharing sensitive data at an immense scale beyond what existing cryptographic platforms can achieve. Here we develop novel computational methods to enable biomedical data integration, analysis, and interpretation in a privacy-preserving and highly scalable manner.",Privacy-preserving genomic medicine at scale,9998648,R01HG010959,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioimaging', 'clinical development', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'cryptography', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'monomethoxypolyethylene glycol', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'privacy preservation', 'statistics', 'success', 'task analysis', 'theories', 'tool']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,636185,0.03218086315250868
"Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration PROJECT SUMMARY The cell nucleus is a heterogeneous organelle that consists of nuclear bodies such as nuclear lamina, speckles, nucleoli and PML bodies. These structures continuously tether and tug chromatin at the small and large scales to synergistically orchestrate dynamic functions in distinct spatio-temporal compartments. A major obstacle to the production of navigable 4D reference maps and relating structure to function in the nucleus remains understanding how these different scales of organization influence each other. In particular, we have a poor understanding of the large-scale genome organization. Growing evidence suggests that such nuclear compartmentalization is causally connected with vital genome functions in human health and disease. However, the principles of this nuclear compartmentalization, its dynamics during changes in cell conditions, and its functional relevance are poorly understood. One lesson from Phase 1 4DN was the huge gap in throughput between imaging methods, that directly measure large-scale multi-landmark relationships, and genomic methods, that aim for whole genome high-resolution maps but are indirect measurements and provide limited information about large-scale compartments. For this 4DN UM1 Center application, we propose to meet these needs through the following Aims: (1) Generate multi-modal imaging and genomic datasets to reveal the structure, dynamics, and function of nuclear compartmentalization; (2) Develop and apply computational tools for data-driven genome structure modeling and integrative analysis of nuclear compartmentalization; (3) Develop an integrative analysis and visualization platform with navigable 4D reference maps of nuclear organization. The combined datasets and results of our proposed approaches will advance our understanding of nuclear compartmentalization, the interwoven connections among different nuclear components, and their functional significance. Our new integrative analysis tools and data-driven predictive models will produce more complete nuclear organization reference maps that integrate large-scale chromosome structure data from live and super-resolution microscopy with multi-modal genomic data including smaller scale chromatin interaction maps and predict functional relationships and dynamic responses. Our navigable reference maps will be publicly accessible through an analysis platform that provides interactive visualization of multiple data types, thus enabling investigators with diverse expertise to simultaneously explore their own data and related datasets/tools and promoting collaborations that will open new horizons into the role of the 4D nucleome in human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will enhance our understanding of nuclear genome organization and functions that are increasingly being linked to health and disease. Because we develop tools to disseminate this information and enable others to work with our data and their own data, we will also bring nuclear architecture to bear on a broad range of ongoing health related research. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that seeks to obtain fundamental knowledge that will help to improve human health.",Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration,10156141,UM1HG011593,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytology', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interphase Chromosome', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cell cycle genetics', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data exploration', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental function', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'multiscale data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,UM1,2020,2075409,-0.008514665175721555
"lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data PROJECT SUMMARY The onset of most human disease involves numerous molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway, and treatment contexts. This system is probed by thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, and integrative analysis of these data can generate testable hypotheses identifying causal genetic variants and linking them to network level changes in cells to disease phenotypes. This can enable deeper molecular-level understanding of pathophysiology, paving the way to genome-based precision medicine.  The long term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through integrative analysis of high- throughput biological data in a disease context. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration methods, created algorithms for the prediction of disease genes through context-specific and mechanistic network models and analysis of quantitative genetics data, and made novel insights into important biological processes and diseases. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by building public interactive systems capable of real-time user-driven integration that are popular among experimental biologists.  We now propose to connect these gene-level functional network approaches with the underlying genomic variation by deciphering how genomic variants lead to specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. We propose to develop ab initio sequence-level models capable of predicting biochemical effects of any genomic variant (including rare or never observed) on chromatin state and RNA regulation, then link these effects with gene-level regulatory consequences (including tissue-specific transcription and RNA splicing), and finally put genomic sequence directly into the network context via a statistical approach for detecting genes and network neighborhoods with a significantly elevated mutational burden in disease. Our key deliverable will be a user- friendly, interactive web-based framework enabling systems-level variant impact analysis in a network context and an open source library for computational scientists. In addition to systematic analysis across contexts and diseases, we will collaborate with experimentalists to apply our methods to Alzheimer’s, autism spectrum disorders, chronic kidney disease, immune diseases, and congenital heart defects as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to directly contribute to better understanding of these diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE To pave the way for mechanistic interpretation of disease in the genomic context and eventually, precision medicine, we will develop algorithms for de novo prediction of functional biochemical effects of noncoding variants at the DNA regulation and RNA processing levels and then build frameworks for sequence-based prediction of tissue-specific transcription and post-transcriptional RNA processes (starting with splicing). To facilitate discovery of disease mechanisms, we will develop approaches for analyzing these variant effects in a network context, including those developed in the previous grant period (mechanistic and functional networks) and novel network models that integrate exon usage information or enhancer-gene interactions. In addition to verifying top predictions experimentally in our group or by our collaborators in case study areas of neurodegenerative disease, chronic kidney disease, ASD, and congenital heart disease, we will make our methods available to the broader biomedical community through public, interactive user interfaces and open source libraries.",lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9902503,R01GM071966,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histones', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunology', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'congenital heart disorder', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,448294,-0.026385313462382085
"Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats Project Summary (Overall)  The purpose of this renewal application is to continue the successful activities of our center, which uses quantitative genetic techniques to study the genetic basis of drug abuse-related behaviors in outbred rats. When our center was initially funded in June 2014, our goal was to develop outbred N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as a platform for genetic studies of behaviors that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. The first four years of funding have allowed us to establish a vibrant community of investigators using HS rats to study drug abuse and other traits, which we refer to as an ecosystem. This ecosystem includes both the investigators who are directly involved in this renewal application and many others who have obtained separate funding, some from NIDA, and some from other sources. The growth of this ecosystem reflects one of the ways that our center has served as national resource. We are proposing three projects that involved phenotyping HS rats for a variety of traits, including intravenous cocaine and nicotine self-administration, response to novelty, social behavior, reaction time, and delay discounting. Two of those projects are continuations from the prior funding period and are designed to increase our sample size from 1,600 to 3,200 rats per phenotype. We present data showing that such an increase produces an exponential increase in the number of significant findings. This approach parallels human genetics studies of SUD, which have also benefited tremendously from larger sample sizes. We will use these data to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a suite of related techniques. In addition, we will measure gene expression in behaviorally naïve rats using RNASeq and use those data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate GWAS and eQTL data in an effort to identify specific genes that influence the behavioral phenotypes. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also study genetic correlations, perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) and explore a novel strategy called polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS), that is intended to allow translation of polygenic signals across species. Project 4 will use a network-based approach to extend our GWAS to account for known biological networks. This proposed renewal also includes a pilot project core to support new directions and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. Finally we propose an administrative core that supports many activities of the center, including educational, career development and public outreach. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genes in a range of psychologically complex behaviors and will provide novel biological insights that may support future efforts at preventing or treating drug abuse. Project Narrative (Overall)  Using powerful genetic, molecular and statistical techniques, we will study the genetic basis of traits that have well-established relevance to drug abuse. We expect that these studies will enhance our understanding of drug abuse and lead to the identification of specific genes and pathways. These discoveries will improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to drug abuse in humans and may identify new opportunities to treat psychiatric disorders including but not limited to addiction.",Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats,9971494,P50DA037844,"['Adolescent', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crime', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Esthesia', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Individual', 'Intravenous', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Network-based', 'Nicotine', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Self Administration', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Reinforcement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'discounting', 'drug abuse related behavior', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'premature', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P50,2020,2985563,-0.017603372832741937
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.
