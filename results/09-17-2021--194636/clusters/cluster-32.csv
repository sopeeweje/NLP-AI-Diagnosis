"Uncovering Population-Level Cellular Relationships to Behavior via Mesoscale Networks Project Summary/Abstract: There is significant current interest in understanding how neurons relate to whole-brain networks and how these networks coordinate to give rise to behavior. We have recently shown that we can decompose Local Field Potential voltage signals recorded from depth electrodes implanted in multiple brain regions into “electrical functional connectomes,” or electomes, which empirically are consistent between individuals in a population and are predictive of behavior. This provides a unique opportunity to use these consistent network properties to anchor and stratify neurons based on their relationship to whole-brain network dynamics, and this approach only uses data that is currently collected or could be collected with minor changes in protocol. This stratification will be consistent across animals, allowing examination of how neurons in different brains relate to whole-brain networks and to behaviors. This will facilitate closer examination of neuron activity by allowing stronger data aggregation across subjects. Neural encoding and decoding models will be required to be faithful at both the individual neuron level and the multi-region voltage dynamic level, constraining neural relationships by known and learned biological properties. This will be accomplished by first building upon our explainable machine learning approach for learning multi-region networks by including historical data to improve the utility of machine learning during pilot studies and creating novel stochastic optimization approaches for real-time mapping of observed data into the networks. Then, we will develop a model capable of embedding neurons into a shared space, where the embedding succinctly reveals how a neuron relates to the electomes. Finally, these vector embeddings will be used to relate neurons to both behavior and the multi-region dynamics in both single-trial and repeated-trial behavioral tasks. Remarkably, a neuron’s embedding and the state of the mesoscale networks can predict the neural encoding a priori to observing behavior and neural firing simultaneously in a new subject. The overarching goal of this proposal is to learn how neurons’ action potentials, long considered to be a fundamental unit of information, relate to whole-brain spatiotemporal voltage patterns and behavior. To uncover this relationship, we will develop novel computational methods capable of learning networks that relate voltage signals from multiple brain regions based upon our previously developed explainable machine learning approach. These networks will then be used to stratify neurons into subtypes consistent across a population of subjects to facilitate the statistical aggregation of data to uncover relationships between multiple scale of neural activity and behavior.",Uncovering Population-Level Cellular Relationships to Behavior via Mesoscale Networks,9775689,R01EB026937,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Behavioral trial', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'connectome', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'member', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector', 'voltage']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,775000,0.025819750118100487
"Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Maladaptive behaviors are a staple of anxiety disorders, yet how specific neural populations drive these behav- iors is unclear. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and their devastating burden, truly effective therapeutics are still lacking; understanding the underlying pathophysiology is critical. This is not a trivial feat considering the multitude of regions involved and the complexity of associated behaviors. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is one region highly implicated in governing adaptive and pathological anxiety states, and medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) neurons are known to regulate motivated behaviors, including those re- lated to anxiety. How mPFC directly modulates BNST activity in anxiety states though is not known. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to study how mPFC neurons that project to BNST engage in anxiety-related behaviors. Experiments will employ contemporary tools to study the precise neurocircuitry during expression of specific anxiety-related phenotypes. First, in rodent models, anxiety-related behaviors will be identified in the presence of an anxiogenic stimulus using recently developed computer vision and machine learning tools that define behaviors from subsecond modules (Aim 1.1). This is a highly quantitative approach to analyze behavior that will track commonly studied behaviors and, importantly, novel behaviors that have been overlooked in the literature. Second, the role of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons in anxiety-related behaviors will be assessed using inhibitory and excitatory optogenetics in combination with the previously described behavioral analysis (Aim 1.2). This neural population will be targeted using new viral strategies that allow for projection specific targeting. Finally, the physiological neural dynamics of these mPFC neurons during the expression of anxiety- related behaviors will be visualized using mountable, miniature microscopes in mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (Aim 2). This activity will be assessed with concurrent behavioral module recording to understand the neuronal dynamics during anxiety-related behaviors. Collectively, these experiments will determine how BNST-projecting mPFC neurons govern expression of the wide gamut of anxiety-related behaviors. Further, the culmination of this study and studies across the neuroscientific community will bear a clearer understanding of how anxiety-related behaviors arise in mental illnesses and will drive development of promising therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is relevant to public health because understanding the neural pathways that contribute to anxiety- related behaviors will drive understanding of its etiology and development of more effective therapeutics. Further, these experiments align with NIMH's mission to characterize the neural circuits of complex behaviors and mental illnesses.",Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles,9741538,F30MH115693,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Foxes', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Head', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathological anxiety', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Ursidae Family', 'Viral', 'anxiety states', 'anxiety-related behavior', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'calcium indicator', 'conditioned fear', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'grasp', 'imaging approach', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'tool', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F30,2019,36170,0.0031332099327033894
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,9798264,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'axonal guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'programs', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,384007,0.08357092648016018
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",9739115,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'intersectionality', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2019,579461,0.07487034228972012
"Intelligent connectomic analysis tool for dense neuronal circuits Intelligent Connectomic Analysis Tool for Dense Neuronal Circuits Project Summary: The lack of basic understanding of neuronal functions and disease processes is a big factor of failures in creating drugs for neurological diseases. High-resolution maps of the complex connectivity of neuronal circuits correlating with functional and/or molecular markers offer invaluable insights into the functional organization of the neuronal structures, which is a key to understanding the brain in health and disease. There is a strong interest in elucidating and quantifying the connectomics of brain networks with subcellular resolution using electron microscopy (EM) and correlate with functional fluorescence microscopy data. The ultimate goal is to elucidate human brain functions and the mechanisms of human brain disorders. This is critically important to enable new diagnostics and therapies for brain disorders.  The reconstruction and analyses of neuronal networks is challenging in part due to the joint requirement of large volume and high resolution and a large gap in connectomic analysis solutions. There is a strong need for next generation, well supported, integrated, easy to use and highly automated analysis tools to detect and classify neurons, trace arbor branches, identify synapses, spines and synaptic vesicles that increase the throughput of otherwise prohibitively time-consuming analyses in connectomic experiments. There is also a strong need for tools to perform downstream data-driven analysis such as functional inference from structure and phenotypic discovery.  Powered by machine learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with Dr. Rachel Wong and 9 additional labs, this project proposes to create an intelligent connectomic analysis (ICA) tool optimized for dense neuronal circuits. The tool will be commercially supported and integrated with DRVision’s flagship product Aivia to (1) provide accurate and automated neuron tracing in 3D EM and 3D fluorescence data up to multi-terabytes, (2) identify pre- and post-synaptic dendrite segments, (3) correlate light and electron microscopy data, quantify and classify neurons and sub-cellular components, (4) extract and analyze neuron circuits, (5) provide tools for phenotype discoveries, (6) seamlessly integrate the pipeline of ground truth (GT) annotation, editing, and machine learning workflow, and (7) access the required computing infrastructure, database connection, and exchange of data with other tools.

"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,9871513,K99NS114179,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Closure by clamp', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Wind', 'Esthesia', 'Failure', 'Fingers', 'Flying body movement', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Odors', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Walking', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'goal oriented behavior', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory stimulus', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,134007,0.0640004830268399
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9730628,R01NS091421,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'feature detection', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,381916,0.03095816505816981
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9775212,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,628430,0.053869610297311674
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown.

"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9835325,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2019,99879,0.035680548671718465
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning.

"Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit Abstract The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated, well-timed movements. The cerebellar cortex seems to have a particular role in learning to time movements. Since the 1960's and 70's, we have known the architecture of the cerebellar microcircuit, but most analyses of cerebellar function during behavior have focused on Purkinje cells. Here, we propose to investigate the cerebellar cortex at an entirely new level by asking how the full cerebellar microcircuit – mossy fiber, granule cells, Golgi cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells – performs neural computations during motor behavior and motor learning. We strive to “crack” the circuit by identifying all elements, recording their electrical activity during movement and learning, and reconstructing a neural circuit model that reproduces the biological data. We will use three established learning systems that all can learn predictive timing: classical conditioning of the eyelid response (mice), predictive timing of forelimb movements (mice), and direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements (monkeys). Our proposal has six key features. First, optogenetics (in mice) will link the discharge of different cerebellar interneurons during movement and learning to their molecular cell types. Second, a machine-learning clustering analysis (in mice and monkeys) will find analogies among the cell populations recorded in our three preparations and will classify neurons according to their putative cell types based on recordings of many parameters of non-Purkinje cells during movement and motor learning. Third, multi- contact electrodes will allow us to record simultaneously from multiple neighboring single neurons and compute spike-timing cross-correlograms (CCGs) to identify the sign of connections; we also will look for changes in CCGs that provide evidence of specific sites of plasticity during learning. Fourth, gCAMP imaging of the granule cell layer will reveal the temporal structure of inputs to the cerebellar microcircuit, and determine whether those inputs are modified in relation to motor learning. Fifth, a model neural network with realistic cerebellar architecture will reveal a single set of model parameters that will transform the measured inputs to the cerebellum in our three movement systems to the measured responses of all neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Sixth, the model will elucidate how mechanisms of synaptic and cellular plasticity at different sites in the cerebellar microcircuit work together to cause motor learning. Project Narrative The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated and well-timed movements. A better understanding of how the cerebellar circuit works and learns will be important for improving human health in cases of stroke, neuro-degenerative motor disease, developmental motor disorders, and adult movement disorders.",Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit,9814049,R01NS112917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brush Cell', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Forelimb', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Indium-111', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smooth Pursuit', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'commune', 'design', 'experimental study', 'eyeblink conditioning', 'eyelid conditioning', 'granule cell', 'improved', 'learned behavior', 'mossy fiber', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1290521,0.03742661833185764
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels.

"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9775220,U19NS107466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2019,2994145,0.10274282637359386
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,9730645,R01NS104892,"['Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Squid', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'feeding', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,386750,0.062100228464116156
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states.

"The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning As animals move about in the environment, they must be able to rapidly assess and update the meaning of cues around them in order to approach reward and avoid danger. Reversal learning, a paradigm commonly used to test behavioral flexibility, involves switching the association between a stimulus and its outcome. For example, a tone that initially predicted a sweet tastant can come to predict a bitter tastant. Two brain regions, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), are involved in tasks that demand flexible responses to the changing significance of stimuli during reversal learning. While several studies have provided evidence that the OFC and BLA interact during reversal learning, little is known about the specific mechanisms of this interaction. In this grant, we propose to use a combination of genetic and cellular imaging techniques in mice to identify and characterize the physiological response properties during reversal learning of BLA neurons that project to OFC. The reversal learning task we employ involves stimuli of multiple modalities that predict outcomes of both positive and negative value to thoroughly elucidate the differential response properties of BLA neurons to stimuli that change their associated reinforcement outcome (Aim 1). In these experiments, the physiological response properties of neurons identified as projecting from BLA to OFC will be compared to the response properties of the overall population. Then, using an optogenetic approach, we will test the causal role of OFC input onto BLA neurons during reversal learning by inhibiting the specific projections from OFC to BLA to test their causal role on behavioral flexibility and on the nature of representations in BLA (Aim 2). The data analysis for both aims involves collaboration with theoretical neuroscientists to use linear classifiers and other sophisticated techniques to understand the nature and dynamics of neural encoding in BLA and its relation to behavior. These experiments promise to shed light on the mechanisms by which cortico-amygdalar circuits mediate flexibility critical for adaptive emotional responses and behavior, an ability that is impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders. This grant investigates the dynamic interactions between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during a reversal learning task involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. The study promises to elucidate mechanisms fundamental to the flexible updating of emotional behavior, mechanisms that likely become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders.",The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning,9676583,R21MH116348,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quinine', 'Research', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Update', 'Virus', 'anatomic imaging', 'behavior test', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'emotional behavior', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fluorophore', 'genetic approach', 'insight', 'lens', 'neurotoxic', 'optogenetics', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virus genetics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2019,243000,0.04626170500167709
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,9805996,K99MH120343,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Behavior', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Viral', 'cell assembly', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'goal oriented behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,129087,0.027416357876979713
"Generation of Human iPSC-derived Entorhinal Cortex Neurons for Probing Selective Neuronal Vulnerability in Alzheimer's Disease In early phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) only specific types of neurons are affected by pathological lesions. As the disease progresses, additional neurons types gradually start expressing signs of pathology and degeneration throughout the brain. A major obstacle to treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is our lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective neuronal vulnerability. Neurons from the layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ECII) are the most vulnerable neurons of the brain, but there are currently no in vitro culture system for these neurons, preventing both an in-depth analysis of genes involved in neuronal vulnerability, and the search for drugs inhibiting early neurodegeneration affecting these neurons. In the parent RF1 grant, we proposed to identify transcription factors (TFs) involved in specifying ECII neuron identity, using both detailed molecular profiles for ECII and control neurons, which we generated at different points of their development, and cutting-edge functional genomics analyses. These TFs will then be used to drive the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) into ECII neurons. While iPSCs provide a versatile platform that can be differentiated into many different neuron types, concerns have been raised that neurons derived from iPSCs are biologically very young, as the iPSC generation protocol “resets” the biological clock of a cell. AD-associated lesions are age-dependent, and we think that an in vitro paradigm adapted to this study of aging is crucial. In this administrative supplement, we thus want to adapt this iPSC protocol for the direct reprogramming of human fibroblasts, using the TFs identified in the parent grant. Directly reprogrammed fibroblasts are not reset biologically and present a biological age that correlates with the age of the fibroblast donor. After having optimized a protocol for direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into ECII neurons, we will provide a proof of concept that these ECII neurons are a good model for probing selective neuronal vulnerability by studying Tau pathology in neurons reprogrammed from fibroblasts of aging donors and of donors with AD mutations. Overall these ECII neurons directly reprogrammed from fibroblasts would be the first in vitro model for the study of the interplay between selective neuronal vulnerability in AD and aging. In Alzheimer’s diseases (AD), only certain regions of the brain are initially affected, followed later by more wide-ranging degeneration. In our parent grant, we proposed to establish the first cell culture system to model the neurons that are most vulnerable in AD, using stem cells. It was recently shown that culture systems involving stem cells generate cells that are young biologically, and not perfectly suited for the study of age- associated degeneration. We now propose to modify our initial protocol using “fibroblast direct reprogramming”, a protocol that does not involve stem cells, and that yields cells than can be biologically much older. This cell culture system would allow AD researchers to investigate, for the first time, the interaction between age and neuronal vulnerability to AD.",Generation of Human iPSC-derived Entorhinal Cortex Neurons for Probing Selective Neuronal Vulnerability in Alzheimer's Disease,9791605,RF1AG054564,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cells', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Fibroblasts', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Grant', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research Personnel', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stem cells', 'Study models', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'abeta accumulation', 'age related', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'aged', 'entorhinal cortex', 'functional genomics', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'mutant', 'neurofibrillary tangle formation', 'overexpression', 'parent grant', 'presenilin-1', 'prevent', 'stem cell differentiation', 'tau Proteins', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor S-II', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIA,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,RF1,2019,423750,-0.05974363910535216
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9818745,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,1164920,0.023344122464281056
"Tools to broaden access to high-throughput functional connectomics Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to develop a widely adoptable, high-throughput, functional connectomics platform to semi-automatically reconstruct and analyze the synaptic connectivity of functionally characterized neuronal microcircuits. We will develop this pipeline in the context of understanding neural microcircuits that control walking, using the Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC) as a model system. The VNC constitutes over a third of the fly central nervous system, and functions like the spinal cord to control movement and sensation of the limbs. It has a tractable number of neurons (~60,000), many of which are genetically identified and anatomically stereotyped, making it an excellent brain region for developing a comprehensive approach to characterize neuronal circuits. Our approach will integrate several technologies from our labs, including in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in walking flies, high-throughput transmission electron microscopy (EM), automated, deep- learning based connectomic reconstruction, and cell morphology-based analytics. Using this pipeline we will generate the first dense functional connectomes of the VNC, including the sensorimotor leg circuitry from multiple male and female flies. We will use these data to test the hypothesis that there exist specific patterns of synaptic connectivity between functional subtypes of leg proprioceptors and motor neurons. By creating the first connectomes of a microcircuit that orchestrates walking behavior, we anticipate this project will provide new and fundamental insight into the circuit basis of sensorimotor transformation and motor control. It will also create an important resource for the Drosophila and neuroscience communities, through publicly available tools and datasets that integrate connectivity, morphology, and cellular physiology data. Moreover, the technical approaches we develop for high-throughput functional connectomics can be readily applied to other brain regions and across species. Project Narrative Detailed mapping of neural computations and the neuronal circuits that underlie them is crucial for a comprehensive understanding central nervous system function in health and disease. Our goal is to develop an accessible, high-throughput pipeline of tools that we will use to dissect the relationship between neuronal connectivity and function in circuits that control walking. We will focus on sensorimotor transformations in the tractable genetic model organism Drosophila to dissect fundamental principles of proprioceptive feedback in motor control, while improving the speed and accessibility of functional connectomics for the broader scientific community.",Tools to broaden access to high-throughput functional connectomics,9822460,RF1MH117808,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chemical Synapse', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrical Synapse', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Leg', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous System control', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Property', 'Proprioceptor', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Walking', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fly', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'light microscopy', 'male', 'motor control', 'motor neuron function', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'sex', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'two-photon']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,RF1,2019,4347595,0.053401592472465016
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9673799,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'confocal imaging', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2019,553859,0.04436650155601332
"Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex Project Summary/Abstract: For animals to execute complicated behaviors, successful motor planning and execution is essential. Moreover, the sequence of events leading to successful goal-based behavior takes place over a wide range of timescales. For example, when walking from home to work, one must first make an abstract, long-timescale decision to go to work, which much then be translated into a sequence of shorter-timescale right-left turning decisions, which are translated into the finely fluctuating electrical patterns that control the muscles. How motor planning and execution occur simultaneously over many timescales in populations of motor cortex neurons is not well understood. Much work in humans and nonhuman primates have shown that visual and auditory stimuli integrate over multiple timescales. This work has shown that early sensory regions, like primary visual cortex, respond to fast fluctuations in the environment. This information is integrated to longer-timescale information in secondary cortical regions, with the longest- timescale information in frontal and association areas. We therefore hypothesize that secondary motor cortex (M2) neurons control behavior over longer timescales than primary motor cortex (M1) neurons. To study this phenomenon, I have built a setup in which head-fixed mice navigate in virtual reality to a rewarded location. In this setup, I can record video from all sides of the animal for high spatiotemporal resolution measurement of motor behaviors. I have developed machine learning algorithms to extract 3D pose data from these videos. In Aim 1, I will use calcium imaging to record large numbers of neurons in mouse M1 and M2 to correlate the activity of individual neurons and populations to the animal’s ongoing pose kinematics. We will supplement with targeted silicon probe recordings to capture fast neural responses. In Aim 2, I will compare the calcium dynamics in populations of M1 and M2 neurons in mice trained to perform a virtual motor planning task versus mice that have not been trained. We hypothesize that training to plan motor actions increases the timescale of M1/M2 neural activity. In Aim 3, we will use optogenetic silencing in specific regions of cortex to perturb the animal’s motor behavior. We hypothesize that the duration of the perturbed movements will be longer when M2 is perturbed than M1. In this way, we will study how different cortical regions relate to behavior over many timescales. This proposal will broaden our knowledge of cortical processing in general, and motor planning and execution in particular. Patients with mental illness, such as ADHD, autism, and Asperger’s disorder show impaired ability to plan upcoming movements. The first step to successfully treating these illnesses is to better understand how motor planning occurs in general. Project Narrative: This proposal will elucidate how motor planning and execution take place simultaneously, over many timescales, and across brain regions. Better understanding motor planning will help generate new treatments for diseases that affect motor planning, like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.",Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex,9752759,F31NS108450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Asperger Syndrome', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laser Scanning Microscopy', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Stereotyping', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'area striata', 'auditory stimulus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'frontal lobe', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromechanism', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2019,38053,0.04376486751746573
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning Contact PD/PI: Raymond, Jennifer L. Project Summary Synapses between neurons are plastic – able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an “error signal” that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers are other cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circuit uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorders, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls.

"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,9872014,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'loss of function', 'motivated behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2019,126090,0.05931686876477267
"Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The integrated sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities that guide adaptive behavior in mammals emerge from neural circuit operations in the neocortex. Understanding the organization of cortical circuits requires comprehensive knowledge of the basic cellular components. The neocortex consists of approximately 80% glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and 20% GABAergic neurons. Although a minority, GABA interneurons are exceptionally diverse, and this diversity may be crucial in regulating the balance and functional operations of cortical circuits. However, systematic identification, enumeration and classification of GABAergic neurons have been a challenging goal. We hypothesize that distinct transcription programs underlie GABA prototype identity and diversity as defined by their position, morphology and basic innervation pattern. Thus we suggest that transcription profiling provides a fundamental starting point and efficient strategy for cell type discovery. Here we propose a multi-faceted approach that integrates genetic targeting, single cell transcriptomics, statistical and computational analysis, morpho-physiological studies to systematically identify and classify GABAergic neurons. We focus on GABA neurons derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which constitute two-third of cortical interneurons, and for which we have built effective genetic tools. We have established a robust single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) method that allows high resolution transcriptome profiling through single mRNA counting using nucleotide barcodes. We will take a two-step ""Targeted-Saturation"" cell screen approach toward systematic discovery of cortical GABA neurons. First, we will apply scRNAseq to a set of GABA subpopulations, captured by intersectional genetic targeting, and discover their distinct transcription signatures. With these phenotype- characterized populations, we hone our statistical analysis to distinguish biological signal vs experimental noise and artifacts, and shape our computation algorithm based on biological ground truth. Thus in contrast to a unsupervised clustering approach to transcriptome analysis, we incorporate extensive empirical information that enable a biology-motivated supervised approach, where well-delineated phenotypes play the key role of training the algorithm and classifier. Second, we will apply scRNASeq to increasingly broader genetic-defined populations of MGE-derived GABA neurons in the primary motor cortex. We will discover transcriptome-predicted cell types and build 2nd round driver lines that target and validate a subset of novel cell types. Our study will build a comprehensive catalog of a major cohort of cortical GABAergic neurons by integrating transcription profiles and basic cell phenotypes. This will establish a cellular foundation for studying inhibitory circuit organization, function, and dysfunction. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will combine genetic engineering, single cell gene expression profiling, computational analysis, anatomical and physiological approaches to systematically discover GABAergic cell types in the mouse neocortex. These studies will facilitate our understanding of the function of cortical neural circuits and yield insight into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. 1",Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex,9754666,R01MH109665,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth Order', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Embryo', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Medial', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Training', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'insight', 'intersectionality', 'learning algorithm', 'molecular marker', 'nerve supply', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'online resource', 'operation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2019,788983,0.03856557447317314
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9775436,R01DA047869,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,279706,0.08051000192011921
"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input.

"Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics A cell is a highly complex system with distributed molecular physiologies in structured sub- cellular compartments whose interplay with the nuclear genome determine the functional characteristics of the cell. A classic example of distributed genomic processes is found in neurons. Learning and memory requires modulation of individual synapses through RNA localization, localized translation, and localized metabolites such as those from dendritic mitochondria. Dendrites of neurons integrate distributed synaptic signals into both electrical and nuclear transcriptional response. Dysfunction of these distributed genomic functions in neurons can result in a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases such as bipolar and depressive disorders, autism, among others. Understanding complex genomic interactions within a single cell requires new technologies: we need nano-scale ability to make genome-wide measurements at highly localized compartments and to effect highly localized functional genomic manipulations, especially in live tissues. To address this need, we propose to establish a Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics using neurons as model systems. The center will develop new optical and nanotechnology approaches to isolate sub-cellular scale components for genomic, metabolomics, and lipidomic analyses. The center will also develop new mass spectrometry methods, molecular biology methods, and informatics models to create a platform technology for sub-cellular genomics. Many human diseases, especially neuropsychiatric diseases, can be traced to dysfunction of organelles and other sub-cellular components.

"MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION ABSTRACT We will use our expertise in somatosensory organization and plasticity to develop novel and automated solutions for cell identification based upon neural activity, in order to decode the algorithms neural circuits use for information processing. Extracellular recordings in sensory cortex have been thought to primarily represent excitatory neuron activity, since these cells comprise ~80% of the total cell population. However, targeted cell recordings in S1 reveal that firing activity is dominated by inhibitory neurons, and that excitatory neurons can show 10-100 fold lower firing rates depending on cortical layer. Furthermore, new findings that reveal the complex relationship between different subtypes of inhibitory neurons make it difficult to relate blindly-recorded firing activity to local- or network-level computations. Clearly, cell-types matter, and massively parallel extracellular recordings that do not enable the simultaneous identification of multiple cell types will be limited in identifying principles for information transmission and encoding. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the complex spontaneous and evoked spike trains from molecularly-identified neurons will provide unique and cell-type specific signatures that will enable cell identification from in vivo extracellular recordings. In collaboration with computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon, we will develop machine-learning algorithms for cell classification, using data collected from in vitro and in vivo recordings. NARRATIVE  Discovery of the Rosetta stone was an archaeological breakthrough, enabling translation of Egyptian hieroglyphics from parallel texts in ancient Greek. Understanding how the activity of different neuronal subtypes contributes to information processing in the brain is in desperate need of a similar cipher. Detailed studies in the cerebral cortex have revealed principles of how small groups of neurons work together, but these small-scale interactions have been difficult to relate to computations performed by larger groups of neurons, typically recorded without knowledge of cell identity, during animal perception and behavior. We will use advances in molecular-cell identification techniques and machine learning to create an automated classifier to decipher cell identity from dense electrophysiological recordings and decode brain function from neural activity.",MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION,9568053,R21NS104821,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Archaeology', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Classification', 'Clear Cell', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cortical Column', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dissent', 'Distant', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'In Vitro', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Somatostatin', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cell type', 'cognitive process', 'excitatory neuron', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'somatosensory', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,197625,-0.01213072299126066
"Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Maladaptive behaviors are a staple of anxiety disorders, yet how specific neural populations drive these behav- iors is unclear. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and their devastating burden, truly effective therapeutics are still lacking; understanding the underlying pathophysiology is critical. This is not a trivial feat considering the multitude of regions involved and the complexity of associated behaviors. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is one region highly implicated in governing adaptive and pathological anxiety states, and medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) neurons are known to regulate motivated behaviors, including those re- lated to anxiety. How mPFC directly modulates BNST activity in anxiety states though is not known. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to study how mPFC neurons that project to BNST engage in anxiety-related behaviors. Experiments will employ contemporary tools to study the precise neurocircuitry during expression of specific anxiety-related phenotypes. First, in rodent models, anxiety-related behaviors will be identified in the presence of an anxiogenic stimulus using recently developed computer vision and machine learning tools that define behaviors from subsecond modules (Aim 1.1). This is a highly quantitative approach to analyze behavior that will track commonly studied behaviors and, importantly, novel behaviors that have been overlooked in the literature. Second, the role of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons in anxiety-related behaviors will be assessed using inhibitory and excitatory optogenetics in combination with the previously described behavioral analysis (Aim 1.2). This neural population will be targeted using new viral strategies that allow for projection specific targeting. Finally, the physiological neural dynamics of these mPFC neurons during the expression of anxiety- related behaviors will be visualized using mountable, miniature microscopes in mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (Aim 2). This activity will be assessed with concurrent behavioral module recording to understand the neuronal dynamics during anxiety-related behaviors. Collectively, these experiments will determine how BNST-projecting mPFC neurons govern expression of the wide gamut of anxiety-related behaviors. Further, the culmination of this study and studies across the neuroscientific community will bear a clearer understanding of how anxiety-related behaviors arise in mental illnesses and will drive development of promising therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is relevant to public health because understanding the neural pathways that contribute to anxiety- related behaviors will drive understanding of its etiology and development of more effective therapeutics. Further, these experiments align with NIMH's mission to characterize the neural circuits of complex behaviors and mental illnesses.",Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles,9541373,F30MH115693,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Foxes', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Head', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathological anxiety', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Ursidae Family', 'Viral', 'anxiety states', 'anxiety-related behavior', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'calcium indicator', 'conditioned fear', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'grasp', 'imaging approach', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'tool', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F30,2018,35678,0.0031332099327033894
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9509569,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,375839,0.03095816505816981
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9594042,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,661507,0.053869610297311674
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9483798,R01NS094659,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'biophysical properties', 'cell type', 'design', 'expectation', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'object shape', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatial integration', 'targeted treatment']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,350000,0.05502567229022854
"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9632111,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2018,99879,0.035680548671718465
"From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the Gap From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the gap Recent advances in experimental technology promise rapid progress in developing a mechanistic understanding of how neural circuit structure, at the synaptic scale, leads to complex sensory, cognitive, and motor behaviors. Volume EM techniques have advanced to the point that neural tissue can be imaged at synaptic resolution in volumes large enough (~ 100 µm) to contain a entire small neuron . Innovations in machine learning approaches to analyzing these EM images have now permitted automated segmentation of these into 3D representations of every neuronal process within the volume. However, significant technical challenges remain to improve EM acquisition and analysis methods to the point of achieving the millimeter-scale volumes required to reconstruct neuronal assemblies underlying complex behaviors. Tools are needed to improve the reliability of EM systems for the acquisition of such large datasets. Automated methods to identify the cell-type of segmented neurites and to characterize the firing patterns of neurons prior to EM imaging are also needed, as are software tools to query and visualize the resulting rich 3D datasets—essentially allowing neuroscientists to carry out ‘virtual experiments.’ Here we propose to develop a set of tools to address each of these problems. These tools will be developed in the context of the songbird, a powerful model organism to study the neural circuits underlying the production and learning of a complex vocal/motor behavior. Neural recordings in singing birds of every known cell type in cortical, thalamic, and basal ganglia circuits, have led to mechanistic circuit-level hypotheses, which in turn make clear and testable predictions about the ultrastructure of neural circuits. The proposed tools would allow neuroscientists to bridge the gap from vEM data to the virtuous circle of hypothesis driven anatomical experimentation, and data-inspired hypotheses. Our proposal describes three Specific Aims directed toward these goals: · Aim 1: Develop tools to acq uire and to automatically segment millimeter-scale EM data sets · Aim 2: Develop tools to densely identify cell-types of segmented neurites using ultrastructural fingerprints · Aim 3: Develop and test a platform for virtual experimentation in segmented and annotated EM datasets PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this BRAIN Initiative project is to develop tools and resources that will facilitate the detailed analysis of brain microconnectivity. We will develop new approaches and optimize existing techniques to facilitate this important new approach to understanding the basic circuitry and computations underlying brain function. The connectomic tools we develop will be of interest to, and will be made accessible to, the broader scientific community; such tools, and the detailed annotated structural datasets they enable, will facilitate the study of neurobiological mechanisms of brain disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and Huntington’s disease.",From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the Gap,9609873,RF1MH117809,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biophysics', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Distant', 'Dorsal', 'Dreams', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Equipment', 'Fees', 'Fingerprint', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'LOC118430 gene', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Songbirds', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'software development', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,RF1,2018,70863,0.03544430640690889
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning.

"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,9536330,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,407497,0.059397242349843976
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9584824,U19NS107466,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2018,2979311,0.10274282637359386
"Crowdsourcing the Fly Connectome Project Summary We propose to build a next generation crowdsourcing platform (code named “FlyWire”) for mapping the fly connectome using transmission electron microscopy images that were acquired at Janelia Research Campus. FlyWire will depart from EyeWire, a previous crowdsourcing platform, in two major ways: (1) Much higher throughput will be attained by leveraging the latest in deep learning. (2) FlyWirers will consist mainly of fly neuroscientists, while EyeWirers were primarily nonscientists. Once minimum usability and functionality are achieved with the Murthy lab as the pilot users, FlyWire will be opened up to the entire Drosophila neurobiology community. All reconstructions will be shared by the community. To motivate productivity and accuracy, the reconstruction of a neuron and its outgoing synapses will be reported through a “micropublication,” with a quantitative formula for assigning authorship. To guide the development of FlyWire, the Murthy lab will reconstruct all presynaptic and postsynaptic partners of a subset of central brain neurons involved in sensory processing and behavior. We will use the connectome of these neurons as a launching point to investigate how feature­selective sensory responses arise and how they are decoded to change behavior. We will also create software tools for matching FlyWire neurons with light microscopic reconstructions of neurons. The proposed project will complement Janelia’s efforts to obtain the fly connectome with FIB­SEM imaging. Janelia’s final FIB­SEM connectome is estimated to take up to five years, though draft connectomes should become available sooner. FlyWire will provide Drosophila neuroscientists with badly needed information about connectivity in the years before the FIB­SEM connectome becomes available. Multiple connectomes will enable the study of variability across individuals and between sexes (FlyWire will reconstruct a female brain, while the first FIB­ SEM connectome will be of a male brain.) Project Narrative We propose to build a next generation platform for crowdsourcing the fly connectome to a community of neuroscientists. The fly connectome will accelerate progress in circuit neuroscience.

"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,9572441,R01NS104892,"['Accelerometer', 'Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Squid', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'feeding', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,386750,0.062100228464116156
"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9534670,R01EB022899,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Formulation', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'light microscopy', 'mathematical methods', 'neuron component', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuronal circuitry', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector', 'web services']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,423985,0.0856867867243366
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9518000,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2018,570779,0.04436650155601332
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9538277,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,477795,0.044993259968125046
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9692121,R01DA047869,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,254642,0.08051000192011921
"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9563948,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2018,33530,0.04354418627411312
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,9502398,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,341250,0.05208789041870864
"2019 Dendrites: Molecules, Structure and Function Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary Dendrites play a central role in neuronal computation by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs to generate the output of the neuron in the form of action potentials. Recent advances in molecular, electrophysiological and imaging techniques have led to a rapid enhancement in our understanding of the mechanisms that shape dendritic structure, function and connectivity and the contribution of dendritic computation to behavior. Computational and theoretical approaches have further refined our views of dendrites and their unique role in brain function. Notably, dendrite structure and function may undergo plastic changes that contribute to nervous system development and learning, and dysfunction in these mechanisms can lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. The 2019 Gordon Research Conference and Seminar on Dendrites will bring together researchers whose latest findings help clarify how the properties of dendrites enable them to perform complex computations important for sensory-motor processing and higher cognitive function.The goal of this meeting is to exchange knowledge at the frontiers of dendrite research and strengthen communication among researchers from numerous disciplines who investigate dendrites. Project Narrative Neuronal dendrites receive and integrate inputs from other neurons to regulate the information flow through neural circuits.

"Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics A cell is a highly complex system with distributed molecular physiologies in structured sub- cellular compartments whose interplay with the nuclear genome determine the functional characteristics of the cell. A classic example of distributed genomic processes is found in neurons. Learning and memory requires modulation of individual synapses through RNA localization, localized translation, and localized metabolites such as those from dendritic mitochondria. Dendrites of neurons integrate distributed synaptic signals into both electrical and nuclear transcriptional response. Dysfunction of these distributed genomic functions in neurons can result in a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases such as bipolar and depressive disorders, autism, among others. Understanding complex genomic interactions within a single cell requires new technologies: we need nano-scale ability to make genome-wide measurements at highly localized compartments and to effect highly localized functional genomic manipulations, especially in live tissues. To address this need, we propose to establish a Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics using neurons as model systems. The center will develop new optical and nanotechnology approaches to isolate sub-cellular scale components for genomic, metabolomics, and lipidomic analyses. The center will also develop new mass spectrometry methods, molecular biology methods, and informatics models to create a platform technology for sub-cellular genomics. Many human diseases, especially neuropsychiatric diseases, can be traced to dysfunction of organelles and other sub-cellular components.

"Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The integrated sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities that guide adaptive behavior in mammals emerge from neural circuit operations in the neocortex. Understanding the organization of cortical circuits requires comprehensive knowledge of the basic cellular components. The neocortex consists of approximately 80% glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and 20% GABAergic neurons. Although a minority, GABA interneurons are exceptionally diverse, and this diversity may be crucial in regulating the balance and functional operations of cortical circuits. However, systematic identification, enumeration and classification of GABAergic neurons have been a challenging goal. We hypothesize that distinct transcription programs underlie GABA prototype identity and diversity as defined by their position, morphology and basic innervation pattern. Thus we suggest that transcription profiling provides a fundamental starting point and efficient strategy for cell type discovery. Here we propose a multi-faceted approach that integrates genetic targeting, single cell transcriptomics, statistical and computational analysis, morpho-physiological studies to systematically identify and classify GABAergic neurons. We focus on GABA neurons derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which constitute two-third of cortical interneurons, and for which we have built effective genetic tools. We have established a robust single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) method that allows high resolution transcriptome profiling through single mRNA counting using nucleotide barcodes. We will take a two-step ""Targeted-Saturation"" cell screen approach toward systematic discovery of cortical GABA neurons. First, we will apply scRNAseq to a set of GABA subpopulations, captured by intersectional genetic targeting, and discover their distinct transcription signatures. With these phenotype- characterized populations, we hone our statistical analysis to distinguish biological signal vs experimental noise and artifacts, and shape our computation algorithm based on biological ground truth. Thus in contrast to a unsupervised clustering approach to transcriptome analysis, we incorporate extensive empirical information that enable a biology-motivated supervised approach, where well-delineated phenotypes play the key role of training the algorithm and classifier. Second, we will apply scRNASeq to increasingly broader genetic-defined populations of MGE-derived GABA neurons in the primary motor cortex. We will discover transcriptome-predicted cell types and build 2nd round driver lines that target and validate a subset of novel cell types. Our study will build a comprehensive catalog of a major cohort of cortical GABAergic neurons by integrating transcription profiles and basic cell phenotypes. This will establish a cellular foundation for studying inhibitory circuit organization, function, and dysfunction. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will combine genetic engineering, single cell gene expression profiling, computational analysis, anatomical and physiological approaches to systematically discover GABAergic cell types in the mouse neocortex. These studies will facilitate our understanding of the function of cortical neural circuits and yield insight into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. 1",Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex,9531438,R01MH109665,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth Order', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Embryo', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Medial', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Training', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'insight', 'intersectionality', 'molecular marker', 'nerve supply', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'online resource', 'operation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,797983,0.03856557447317314
"MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION ABSTRACT We will use our expertise in somatosensory organization and plasticity to develop novel and automated solutions for cell identification based upon neural activity, in order to decode the algorithms neural circuits use for information processing. Extracellular recordings in sensory cortex have been thought to primarily represent excitatory neuron activity, since these cells comprise ~80% of the total cell population. However, targeted cell recordings in S1 reveal that firing activity is dominated by inhibitory neurons, and that excitatory neurons can show 10-100 fold lower firing rates depending on cortical layer. Furthermore, new findings that reveal the complex relationship between different subtypes of inhibitory neurons make it difficult to relate blindly-recorded firing activity to local- or network-level computations. Clearly, cell-types matter, and massively parallel extracellular recordings that do not enable the simultaneous identification of multiple cell types will be limited in identifying principles for information transmission and encoding. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the complex spontaneous and evoked spike trains from molecularly-identified neurons will provide unique and cell-type specific signatures that will enable cell identification from in vivo extracellular recordings. In collaboration with computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon, we will develop machine-learning algorithms for cell classification, using data collected from in vitro and in vivo recordings. NARRATIVE  Discovery of the Rosetta stone was an archaeological breakthrough, enabling translation of Egyptian hieroglyphics from parallel texts in ancient Greek. Understanding how the activity of different neuronal subtypes contributes to information processing in the brain is in desperate need of a similar cipher. Detailed studies in the cerebral cortex have revealed principles of how small groups of neurons work together, but these small-scale interactions have been difficult to relate to computations performed by larger groups of neurons, typically recorded without knowledge of cell identity, during animal perception and behavior. We will use advances in molecular-cell identification techniques and machine learning to create an automated classifier to decipher cell identity from dense electrophysiological recordings and decode brain function from neural activity.",MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION,9449797,R21NS104821,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Archaeology', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Classification', 'Clear Cell', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cortical Column', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dissent', 'Distant', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'In Vitro', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Somatostatin', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cell type', 'cognitive process', 'excitatory neuron', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'somatosensory', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,237150,-0.01213072299126066
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools.

"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs.

"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them.

"Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits Project Summary  Of the diverse features of the mammalian motor repertoire, skilled limb movements have become some of the more impressive and indispensable ways of interacting with the environment. The susceptibility of these movements to neurodegenerative disease and injury underscores the need for a better understanding of how neural circuits orchestrate these dexterous behaviors. This goal demands sophisticated experimental scrutiny at both neural and behavioral levels, and while the emergence of genetic tools for monitoring and manipulating neural circuits in mice has been transformative, the development of motor behavioral assays has not kept pace. Typically, a single behavioral test is applied to the question at hand, precluding a more comprehensive description of why relevant neural circuits have evolved their particular anatomical and functional attributes. Moreover, in the study of limb motor control, primate-inspired behavioral paradigms tend to be applied to the mouse by default, risking neglect of a more complete and naturalistic account of motor circuit function.  Ethology emphasizes an unbiased study of behavior under natural conditions. This proposal describes an ethological approach for the quantification and categorization of skilled limb movements in mice, enabling a depth and breadth of behavioral analysis that more closely aligns with the complexity of the underlying neural circuits. Several complementary approaches for unbiased behavioral quantification of mouse limb movements in enriched environments will be developed in parallel: a set of optical techniques enabling automated three- dimensional reconstruction of limb and digit posture and trajectory; and an approach that leverages advances in the miniaturization of motion sensors for camera-free limb tracking that can be integrated seamlessly with neural and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Through iterative refinement, this multifaceted strategy should highlight the strengths and mitigate potential drawbacks of each tracking method, providing a suite of complementary quantitative tools. Kinematic, kinetic, EMG and neural data collected across diverse behavioral contexts will be used to guide machine learning-based classification of natural structure in limb movements and in their underlying neural circuits. As a proving ground for how these naturalistic behavioral analyses can be integrated with the genetic dissection of neural circuit function, a set of molecularly defined motor circuits will be probed using novel optogenetic tools that permit selective inhibition at defined axon collateral terminals. This combination of projection specific genetic perturbation and ethologically driven behavioral analyses will provide a powerful lens through which to view the fine-grained functional organization of mammalian motor circuits. More generally, this merging of molecular and systems neuroscience approaches will offer a novel way to explore and compare fine motor control across species, equipping the field with a more comprehensive and standardized approach to study skilled behavior, and helping lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of behavioral deficits associated with neural circuit dysfunction. Project Narrative Skilled limb movements play a central role in mammalian behavior, from the seemingly mundane to the astoundingly athletic – yet little is known about how specific neural circuits orchestrate limb motor output to ensure precision and dexterity. To identify the neural basis of skilled behaviors, a more comprehensive and quantitative understanding of natural limb movements in mice is needed to take better advantage of the powerful genetic accessibility of this model system. The ability to track and define these skilled, natural movements will enable a more sensitive and empirical exploration of the neural control of behavior, and should lay the groundwork for more effective diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits caused by disease or injury.",Neural control of skilled movements: an ethological dissection of genetically tractable mammalian motor circuits,9351131,DP2NS105555,"['Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electromyography', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Injury', 'Kinetics', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'dexterity', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'kinematics', 'lens', 'limb movement', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,DP2,2017,2910000,0.035680548671718465
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. n/a","CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling",9315937,R01NS100049,"['Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Huntington Disease', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'control theory', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional plasticity', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mathematical analysis', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'sensorimotor system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,205290,0.056505447820377586
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,9247804,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Genetic', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Injectable', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,418329,0.11850294971373411
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,9450709,R01NS104892,"['Accelerometer', 'Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Recurrence', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Squid', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'feeding', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,386750,0.062100228464116156
"Cerebellar network mapping with a high-throughput TEM platform Project Summary/Abstract A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to understand how information is processed in neuronal circuits. Ultimately, we would like to understand the relationship between circuit structure and network function. However, the immense complexity of most brain networks has been a significant barrier to progress. Neurons are a primary computational component of networks in the brain, yet we do not have a comprehensive list of their types for even the simplest mammalian neuronal circuit. Moreover, a neuron’s function is fundamentally dependent on how it is connected within its network, yet mammalian neuronal networks consist of billions of cells with trillions of connections. How can we get a handle on such a complex computational machine? Recent advances in large-scale electron microscopy (EM) and molecular genetic tools have allowed us to begin detailed mapping of neural network anatomy and cellular physiology. The cerebellum is an excellent system to validate our novel platform as part of a systematic effort to reverse engineer a functional neural circuit that is involved in motor control and social behavior. Its basic structure is well ordered, relatively simple and sufficiently described to have inspired computational models that capture aspects of cerebellar function. However, even the most advanced models are limited by an incomplete characterization of the cell types and connectivity within the cerebellum. Here, we propose to validate our next-generation large-scale EM platform and provide a comprehensive characterization of cerebellar circuitry. We will use tools recently developed in our lab to a circuit that offers the advantages of relative simplicity and a strong starting foundation. These studies will allow us to understand principles of cerebellar circuit organization and may help us determine the role of specific circuit elements in neurodegenerative disorders. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to understand the organizational principles underlying cerebellar circuits. We will use large-scale electron microscopy to extract cerebellar network anatomy.

"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise.

"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9402502,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2017,581182,0.04436650155601332
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9324362,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Plasticizers', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,479269,0.044993259968125046

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9470632,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2017,33050,0.04354418627411312
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,9284528,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,341250,0.05208789041870864
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects.

"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown.

"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning.

"The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states Abstract  In the last decade it has become increasingly apparent that epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression play an important role in brain function and dysfunction. Disruption in neuroepigenetic developmental processes such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation result in mental retardation and cognitive impairments. More recently, neuroepigenetic processes have also been implicated in adult behaviors, such as addiction and memory. This opens the possibility that these mechanisms may be able to control the establishment and maintenance of behavioral states. However, the underlying mechanisms through which neuroepigenetic processes can mediate changes in circuit excitability to determine behavioral states remain mysterious. Moreover, because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the mammalian brain, we have no knowledge about the genetic loci of integration between the environment and behavior, and the identity of the neural pathways that control them in specific circuits. This presents a major roadblock towards unlocking the interface between brain and environment and their role in human health and disease. Here we propose a three-prong solution to this problem by using: a brain that shows conserved neurochemistry and neuroepigenetic mechanisms, but with orders of magnitude fewer neurons and homogenous circuits compared to mammalian brains, behaviors that are regulated by the environment (hunger and satiety), and an environment that is experimentally controllable (fasting vs. re-feeding; normal diet vs. high sugar diet). Changes in the excitability and plasticity of conserved circuits determine outputs feeding states like hunger and satiety. These changes occur slow, are persistent over hours, depend on the physiological state and are bidirectional. Thus, they could be encoded neuroepigenetically to alter the expression of key genes important to modulate circuit excitability. Furthermore, because a large number of metabolism intermediates functions as cofactors for chromatin modifying enzymes, physiological changes in metabolites and nutrients can directly alter gene expression. My lab has pioneered techniques and established unique collaborations to address the functional role of neuroepigenetic processes in regulating the activity of specific circuits in the context of feeding states. We propose to map how environmental inputs act on chromatin and gene expression to direct the changes in neuronal excitability that underlie output feeding behaviors. First, we will identify the specific chromatin pathways that act in a unique circuit important to switch the behavioral state of the fly between hungry and sated. We will then map the functional genetic loci of integration between physiological state and output behavioral states by examining the occupancy of these pathways on chromatin and their effect on behavior and neural activity. We will then dissect how changes in environmental input (energy scarcity in fasting, energy availability in re-feeding, and energy surplus in a high sugar diet) directly affect gene expression by altering the activity of these pathways and their genetic loci of integration. To this end, we will work with analytical chemists to develop new methods to measure changes in metabolites in the blood, brain and specific circuits and with computational biologists to harness machine learning analysis to integrate metabolism and gene expression datasets to identify the molecular pathways that act at the interface between input and effector mechanisms to regulate output behavioral states. Because the endocrine and physiological changes that underlie hunger and satiety are evolutionary conserved, our approach will provide a model of how the environment can functionally determine bidirectional, flip-flop behavioral states through neuroepigenetic mechanisms. More broadly, these studies will uncover how epigenetic mechanisms may function as gatekeepers of “behavioral states” (normal and abnormal), to provide the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the “conditioning” effect of environments (from nutrients to maternal care) on neural plasticity. Public Health Relevance Statement: The proposed study will identify how nutrients in diet play a key role in regulating hunger and satiety states by changing neuronal activity and behavior. This will pave the way to understanding how the increased consumption of calories is linked to diseases such as depression, cancer, aging and neurodegeneration. More broadly, these experiments will identify in detail the molecular and physiological adaptations of a cellular system to a changing environment, develop new methodologies to study metabolism, and computational tool to integrate large orthogonal gene expression and metabolism datasets.",The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states,9167992,DP2DK113750,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Calories', 'Caring', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data Set', 'Developmental Process', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fasting', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Functional disorder', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hunger', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Retardation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Nutrient', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Adaptation', 'Play', 'Process', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'addiction', 'brain behavior', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'conditioning', 'feeding', 'fly', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'neurochemistry', 'neuronal excitability', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sugar']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,DP2,2016,2009885,0.01526172364886534
"Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, in addition to driving and gating active sensation through taste, smell, and touch. We propose to exploit the advent of molecular and genetic tools to undertake cell lineage marking, cell phenotyping, molecular connectomics, and methods from machine learning and image processing to construct an integrated anatomical and functional atlas of the brainstem. This will enable us to generate anatomical wiring diagrams for the brainstem circuits that control or facial actions. There are three phases to this work. (1) Reveal the identity and organization of brainstem nuclei. Motivated by striking similarities between the developmental plan for the spinal cord and brainstem, we will embrace and extend these efforts to interrogate the molecular composition of neurons that define individual nuclei with sensorimotor circuits in the murine brainstem. (2) Reveal brainstem neuronal circuits and their interactions. We will utilize Tran synaptic viral labeling to delimit pathways from specific muscles that are innervated by facial, trigeminal, hypoglossal, and laryngeal motor nuclei. This will reveal hitherto unknown brainstem circuits, including sites of modulation by higher brain areas. (3) Control the behavior of identified feedback circuits. We will manipulate specific populations of brainstem neurons using a battery of genetic tools to delineate or facial motor actions and motor synergies.  The results from the above efforts will be a quantitative map of the functional organization of neurons in the brainstem that enable studies on computations that underlie or facial behavior. An understanding of these fundamental behaviors bears directly on the more general issue of how nervous systems deal with computations that can be performed autonomously, yet must interact synergistically. Thus our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The work performed under this proposal will serve as the basis for a larger national effort in brainstem neuronal computation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and or facial behaviors such as suckling and chewing that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use the tools of modern molecular neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, and connect circuits with behavioral function. Our procedures and analysis will mitigate many of the difficulties that have limited our ability to discern the structre and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits,9119887,U01NS090595,"['Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Comparative Anatomy', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Embryonic Development', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Jaw', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neck', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nociception', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smell Perception', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Taste Perception', 'Technology', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tongue', 'Touch sensation', 'Trigeminal System', 'Ursidae Family', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'dynamic system', 'feeding', 'image processing', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuronal circuitry', 'orofacial', 'programs', 'sensory input', 'tool', 'visual tracking', 'vocalization']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2016,856447,0.08046270285366672
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,9070769,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Health', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,418411,0.11850294971373411
"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,9109046,R01MH103108,"['Address', 'Adhesions', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'cognitive task', 'combinatorial', 'connectome', 'cost', 'genetic manipulation', 'information processing', 'mental function', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'research study', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,313000,0.09237219785937767
"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9170501,R01EB022899,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Formulation', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'light microscopy', 'mathematical methods', 'neuron component', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuronal circuitry', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'web services']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2016,450322,0.0856867867243366
"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice.

"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,9098854,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2016,248999,0.04273678614704311
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9113674,R01NS072406,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,476856,0.044993259968125046
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,9097799,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,341250,0.05208789041870864
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.                ",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9030044,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'light microscopy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,340627,0.03095816505816981
"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative. The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.",High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits,8856373,R01NS076467,"['2 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Fast Electron', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'design', 'experience', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nanometer', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'young adult']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,1543491,0.051766388918782366

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction.

"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functioning of the normal, healthy brain, such as in sensory processing and motor actions, depends on the precise interactions of millions of nerve cells.  Brain diseases are increasingly linked to changes in these complex interactions between large populations of nerve cells.

Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functioning of the normal, healthy brain, such as in sensory processing and motor actions, depends on the precise interactions of millions of nerve cells.  Brain diseases are increasingly linked to changes in these complex interactions between large populations of nerve cells.   The current project develops novel imaging tools and analysis concepts to simultaneously study large groups of nerve cells in the awake brain with high temporal and cellular resolution, and will lay the groundwork for deeper insights into how the brain processes information and may provide mechanistic insights into brain disorders such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia.",Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics,8935976,U01NS090569,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'auditory discrimination', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cell type', 'density', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'millisecond', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",U01,2015,250000,0.09952263865718285
"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,8899642,R01MH103108,"['Address', 'Adhesions', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'cognitive task', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'genetic manipulation', 'information processing', 'mental function', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'research study', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2015,313000,0.09237219785937767
"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution. In parallel, we will also search for novel naturally occurring opsins in niche environments. The expanded optogenetic toolkit will facilitate the investigation of neuronal circuits in health and disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain disorders take a great toll in the US and worldwide. Progress has been limited by the availability of tools to investigate neuronal circuits with temporal and special specificity until the development of optogenetics.

"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8898252,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2015,249000,0.04273678614704311
"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits. First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states. These detailed datasets and models will reveal general principles of circuit organization, provide a resource for scientists in these two important fields, and allow computational biologists to test and develop algorithms. We will broadly disseminate our tools and methods to the community, enabling researchers to dissect any cell circuit of interest at unprecedented detail. Our work will open the way for reconstructing cellular circuits in human disease and individuals, to improve the accuracy of both diagnosis and treatment.       RELEVANCE:  While it is now possible to rapidly identify genes that contribute to human disease, it is remains a major challenge to explain how these genes work together to carry out their normal functions or cause disease.

"Neural Basis of Shape from Texture DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People often need to judge the shapes and movements of 3-D objects from a distance. Images on the retinae are 2-D, but pattern and motion information contain cues about 3-D shapes. Building on our previous work we expect to make significant progress in understanding 3-D shape perception from these cues, and thus offer a prototype for how the brain extracts information from the world to infer environmental properties. When surfaces have texture patterns, deformations of these patterns in retinal images provide clues for the brain to judge 3-D shape. When signals from the eyes reach the first cortical area V1, they are processed by neurons that are selectively tuned to orientations and spatial frequencies. We parsed texture deformations into orientation flows and spatial frequency gradients, to show that particular orientation flows evoke percepts of specific 3-D shapes, whereas frequency gradients provide cues to relative depth. These results led to models of how later cortical neurons could extract texture patterns and signal 3-D shapes. We now propose to extend our approach beyond static objects. When objects change shape (e.g. by bending, coiling, or contracting) as they move (e.g. walk, tumble, crawl, hop, slide, or swim), changes in the retinal image create patterns of local velocities that provide additional cues to 3-D shape. Since any retinal image can result from projections of many different 3-D objects, the brain relies on prior assumptions to infer the correct shape. Previous studies have only looked at rigid objects and used shape inference models based either on the brain assuming that the object is rigid or that faster points are nearer. We will use novel stimuli that put these prior assumptions in conflict, and thus examine how the brain potentiates a prior. This section will culminate in a model for choosing between conflicting assumptions, something that is often required in perception and cognition. Next, we will use randomly deforming non-rigid 3-D waves to examine how global shape properties, e.g. symmetry, influence perceived object motions by selectively combining disparate outputs of motion sensitive neurons. These results will unveil interactions between the form and motion cortical systems. Finally, we will examine observers' percepts of dynamic shape changes that require more sophisticated analyses of retinal velocity patterns. Neurons in the motion sensitive cortical area MT respond to 1-D motion shear and compression/divergence, so we will extract these qualities and combine them into 2-D velocity patterns of divergence, rotation, and deformation. Neural filters formed by these patterns will be used to explain perceived changes in 3-D shapes. We will base our filters on responses of MT and later cortical neurons to our stimuli, measured in a parallel project. We will thus present the first neural model that can explain observers' percepts of both rigid and non-rigid textured objects. The performance of our model will be compared against the best computer-vision models on motion-capture data from real deforming objects. We expect this project to introduce new ideas, methods and results for understanding visual perception of 3-D shapes and its deficits in neurological patients. Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously. This project will identify how the brain constructs correct and incorrect shape percepts of 3-D objects from texture and motion information. In addition, people with amblyopia, strabismus and convergence-insufficiency often have deficient stereo vision, so they find texture and motion information to be particularly useful in perceiving 3-D shapes, hence our work on separating velocity information into object motion, object shape, and shape deformation may be particularly useful to these people.",Neural Basis of Shape from Texture,8843856,R01EY013312,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amblyopia', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Contracts', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Frequencies', 'Geometry', 'Head Movements', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Rotation', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Space Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Strabismus', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analog', 'area MT', 'area V1', 'base', 'design', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'novel', 'object motion', 'object shape', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sample fixation']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2015,354693,0.0062249775112688645
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.            ",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,8964760,R01NS072406,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Plastics', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,473336,0.044993259968125046
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,8928250,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,341250,0.05208789041870864
"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.

"Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, in addition to driving and gating active sensation through taste, smell, and touch. We propose to exploit the advent of molecular and genetic tools to undertake cell lineage marking, cell phenotyping, molecular connectomics, and methods from machine learning and image processing to construct an integrated anatomical and functional atlas of the brainstem. This will enable us to generate anatomical wiring diagrams for the brainstem circuits that control or facial actions. There are three phases to this work. (1) Reveal the identity and organization of brainstem nuclei. Motivated by striking similarities between the developmental plan for the spinal cord and brainstem, we will embrace and extend these efforts to interrogate the molecular composition of neurons that define individual nuclei with sensorimotor circuits in the murine brainstem. (2) Reveal brainstem neuronal circuits and their interactions. We will utilize Tran synaptic viral labeling to delimit pathways from specific muscles that are innervated by facial, trigeminal, hypoglossal, and laryngeal motor nuclei. This will reveal hitherto unknown brainstem circuits, including sites of modulation by higher brain areas. (3) Control the behavior of identified feedback circuits. We will manipulate specific populations of brainstem neurons using a battery of genetic tools to delineate or facial motor actions and motor synergies.  The results from the above efforts will be a quantitative map of the functional organization of neurons in the brainstem that enable studies on computations that underlie or facial behavior. An understanding of these fundamental behaviors bears directly on the more general issue of how nervous systems deal with computations that can be performed autonomously, yet must interact synergistically. Thus our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The work performed under this proposal will serve as the basis for a larger national effort in brainstem neuronal computation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and or facial behaviors such as suckling and chewing that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use the tools of modern molecular neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, and connect circuits with behavioral function. Our procedures and analysis will mitigate many of the difficulties that have limited our ability to discern the structre and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.                ",Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits,8827174,U01NS090595,"['Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Comparative Anatomy', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Embryonic Development', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Group Meetings', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Jaw', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neck', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nociception', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smell Perception', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Taste Perception', 'Technology', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tongue', 'Touch sensation', 'Trigeminal System', 'Ursidae Family', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer studies', 'feeding', 'image processing', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'nerve stem cell', 'orofacial', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'visual tracking', 'vocalization']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2014,851597,0.08046270285366672
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,8710346,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,418570,0.11850294971373411
"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functioning of the normal, healthy brain, such as in sensory processing and motor actions, depends on the precise interactions of millions of nerve cells.  Brain diseases are increasingly linked to changes in these complex interactions between large populations of nerve cells.

"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.

"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution. In parallel, we will also search for novel naturally occurring opsins in niche environments. The expanded optogenetic toolkit will facilitate the investigation of neuronal circuits in health and disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain disorders take a great toll in the US and worldwide.

"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8892350,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2014,249000,0.04273678614704311
"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits. First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states. These detailed datasets and models will reveal general principles of circuit organization, provide a resource for scientists in these two important fields, and allow computational biologists to test and develop algorithms.

"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits. First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states. These detailed datasets and models will reveal general principles of circuit organization, provide a resource for scientists in these two important fields, and allow computational biologists to test and develop algorithms. We will broadly disseminate our tools and methods to the community, enabling researchers to dissect any cell circuit of interest at unprecedented detail. Our work will open the way for reconstructing cellular circuits in human disease and individuals, to improve the accuracy of both diagnosis and treatment.       RELEVANCE:  While it is now possible to rapidly identify genes that contribute to human disease, it is remains a major challenge to explain how these genes work together to carry out their normal functions or cause disease.

"Neural Basis of Shape from Texture     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People often need to judge the shapes and movements of 3-D objects from a distance. Images on the retinae are 2-D, but pattern and motion information contain cues about 3-D shapes. Building on our previous work we expect to make significant progress in understanding 3-D shape perception from these cues, and thus offer a prototype for how the brain extracts information from the world to infer environmental properties. When surfaces have texture patterns, deformations of these patterns in retinal images provide clues for the brain to judge 3-D shape. When signals from the eyes reach the first cortical area V1, they are processed by neurons that are selectively tuned to orientations and spatial frequencies. We parsed texture deformations into orientation flows and spatial frequency gradients, to show that particular orientation flows evoke percepts of specific 3-D shapes, whereas frequency gradients provide cues to relative depth. These results led to models of how later cortical neurons could extract texture patterns and signal 3-D shapes. We now propose to extend our approach beyond static objects. When objects change shape (e.g. by bending, coiling, or contracting) as they move (e.g. walk, tumble, crawl, hop, slide, or swim), changes in the retinal image create patterns of local velocities that provide additional cues to 3-D shape. Since any retinal image can result from projections of many different 3-D objects, the brain relies on prior assumptions to infer the correct shape. Previous studies have only looked at rigid objects and used shape inference models based either on the brain assuming that the object is rigid or that faster points are nearer. We will use novel stimuli that put these prior assumptions in conflict, and thus examine how the brain potentiates a prior. This section will culminate in a model for choosing between conflicting assumptions, something that is often required in perception and cognition. Next, we will use randomly deforming non-rigid 3-D waves to examine how global shape properties, e.g. symmetry, influence perceived object motions by selectively combining disparate outputs of motion sensitive neurons. These results will unveil interactions between the form and motion cortical systems. Finally, we will examine observers' percepts of dynamic shape changes that require more sophisticated analyses of retinal velocity patterns. Neurons in the motion sensitive cortical area MT respond to 1-D motion shear and compression/divergence, so we will extract these qualities and combine them into 2-D velocity patterns of divergence, rotation, and deformation. Neural filters formed by these patterns will be used to explain perceived changes in 3-D shapes. We will base our filters on responses of MT and later cortical neurons to our stimuli, measured in a parallel project. We will thus present the first neural model that can explain observers' percepts of both rigid and non-rigid textured objects. The performance of our model will be compared against the best computer-vision models on motion-capture data from real deforming objects. We expect this project to introduce new ideas, methods and results for understanding visual perception of 3-D shapes and its deficits in neurological patients.          Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously. This project will identify how the brain constructs correct and incorrect shape percepts of 3-D objects from texture and motion information. In addition, people with amblyopia, strabismus and convergence-insufficiency often have deficient stereo vision, so they find texture and motion information to be particularly useful in perceiving 3-D shapes, hence our work on separating velocity information into object motion, object shape, and shape deformation may be particularly useful to these people.

"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.                ",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,8761846,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,339427,0.05208789041870864
"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.

"Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The subcellular distribution of synapses is critical for the assembly, function, and plasticity of the nervous system and plays a role in its disorders. Underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain largely unknown. While advanced multidimensional images, in conjunction with single-cell genetic techniques, have afforded an unprecedented opportunity to understand synapse development at a new level, there is a knowledge gap in our capacity to effectively quantify subcellular synapses from large quantities of three-dimensional images. This is a significant problem and has hampered large-scale studies of the molecular mechanisms of synapse development, especially in neurons with complex arbor-such as Purkinje cells in mammals and lobula plate tangential cells (LPTC) in Drosophila-where existing approaches do not yield complete or robust synapse quantification for the entire dendritic tree and do not scale to efficient genetic screening. The objective of thi project is to bridge this gap by providing tools for quantitative investigation of subcellular synapse distribution and its molecular mechanisms using three-dimensional microscopy images. Specifically, our highly cross- disciplinary team will pursue two aims: (1) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Holistic and objective description of synapse density will enable automatic detection of mutant patterns. (2) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in different parts of the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Efficient quantification at distinct subcellular locations will assist discovery of novel regulators for different subcellular parts. As a test case, we will use synapse distribution n Drosophila LPTC neurons, which are amenable to both genome-wide genetic screens and genetic manipulations with single-neuron resolution. We will develop reliable methods to characterize the density of inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory cholinergic synapses from three-dimensional fluorescence confocal images. Our algorithms will lead to the next level of mechanistic understanding that controls the subcellular distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and enable a wide range of quantitative analyses for other types of neurons with similar complexity. Powerful multichannel co-analysis and machine learning approaches will be used to improve synapse detection and subcellular compartment extraction for overcoming challenges in 3D confocal image, including staining artifacts and anisotropic resolution. Algorithms will be developed using a model-guided methodology that emphasizes efficiency for large volume 3D images during genetic screening. Pattern-recognition methods will be used to speed up proofreading of the synapse quantification results. A novel ordering strategy will be adapted for neurons of complex dendritic arbor to quantify subcellular synapses in a functionally meaningful way. The project will produce a set of open-source, extensible tools for automatic synapse quantification and proofreading, with friendly graphical-user interfaces, to serve the neuroscience community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying molecular mechanisms for the subcellular distribution of synapses remain largely unknown, which hinders the discovery of novel therapies for many neurological disorders. By developing new, efficient automatic algorithms and open-source tools for quantifying synapses in neurons, this research intends to advance the capacity to effectively analyze large quantities of three-dimensional neuronal images, especially those of complex dendritic arbor. The work will impact public health by enabling a better understanding of disease mechanisms, which is the critical first step toward new treatments, and supports NIH's goal to advance understanding of fundamental biology to uncover the causes of specific diseases.            ",Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor,8574710,R15MH099569,"['Academic Research Enhancement Awards', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic synapse', 'density', 'falls', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,R15,2013,461165,0.02716187684452409
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.            ",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,8558913,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,413444,0.11850294971373411
"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.                ",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,8639755,R01MH103108,"['Address', 'Adhesions', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'genetic manipulation', 'information processing', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2013,313000,0.09237219785937767
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures.

"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits.

"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Neural Basis of Shape from Texture     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People often need to judge the shapes and movements of 3-D objects from a distance. Images on the retinae are 2-D, but pattern and motion information contain cues about 3-D shapes. Building on our previous work we expect to make significant progress in understanding 3-D shape perception from these cues, and thus offer a prototype for how the brain extracts information from the world to infer environmental properties. When surfaces have texture patterns, deformations of these patterns in retinal images provide clues for the brain to judge 3-D shape. When signals from the eyes reach the first cortical area V1, they are processed by neurons that are selectively tuned to orientations and spatial frequencies. We parsed texture deformations into orientation flows and spatial frequency gradients, to show that particular orientation flows evoke percepts of specific 3-D shapes, whereas frequency gradients provide cues to relative depth. These results led to models of how later cortical neurons could extract texture patterns and signal 3-D shapes. We now propose to extend our approach beyond static objects. When objects change shape (e.g. by bending, coiling, or contracting) as they move (e.g. walk, tumble, crawl, hop, slide, or swim), changes in the retinal image create patterns of local velocities that provide additional cues to 3-D shape. Since any retinal image can result from projections of many different 3-D objects, the brain relies on prior assumptions to infer the correct shape. Previous studies have only looked at rigid objects and used shape inference models based either on the brain assuming that the object is rigid or that faster points are nearer. We will use novel stimuli that put these prior assumptions in conflict, and thus examine how the brain potentiates a prior. This section will culminate in a model for choosing between conflicting assumptions, something that is often required in perception and cognition. Next, we will use randomly deforming non-rigid 3-D waves to examine how global shape properties, e.g. symmetry, influence perceived object motions by selectively combining disparate outputs of motion sensitive neurons. These results will unveil interactions between the form and motion cortical systems. Finally, we will examine observers' percepts of dynamic shape changes that require more sophisticated analyses of retinal velocity patterns. Neurons in the motion sensitive cortical area MT respond to 1-D motion shear and compression/divergence, so we will extract these qualities and combine them into 2-D velocity patterns of divergence, rotation, and deformation. Neural filters formed by these patterns will be used to explain perceived changes in 3-D shapes. We will base our filters on responses of MT and later cortical neurons to our stimuli, measured in a parallel project. We will thus present the first neural model that can explain observers' percepts of both rigid and non-rigid textured objects. The performance of our model will be compared against the best computer-vision models on motion-capture data from real deforming objects. We expect this project to introduce new ideas, methods and results for understanding visual perception of 3-D shapes and its deficits in neurological patients.          Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously. This project will identify how the brain constructs correct and incorrect shape percepts of 3-D objects from texture and motion information. In addition, people with amblyopia, strabismus and convergence-insufficiency often have deficient stereo vision, so they find texture and motion information to be particularly useful in perceiving 3-D shapes, hence our work on separating velocity information into object motion, object shape, and shape deformation may be particularly useful to these people.

"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.

Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells.

"Neural Basis of Shape from Texture     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People often need to judge the shapes and movements of 3-D objects from a distance. Images on the retinae are 2-D, but pattern and motion information contain cues about 3-D shapes. Building on our previous work we expect to make significant progress in understanding 3-D shape perception from these cues, and thus offer a prototype for how the brain extracts information from the world to infer environmental properties. When surfaces have texture patterns, deformations of these patterns in retinal images provide clues for the brain to judge 3-D shape. When signals from the eyes reach the first cortical area V1, they are processed by neurons that are selectively tuned to orientations and spatial frequencies. We parsed texture deformations into orientation flows and spatial frequency gradients, to show that particular orientation flows evoke percepts of specific 3-D shapes, whereas frequency gradients provide cues to relative depth. These results led to models of how later cortical neurons could extract texture patterns and signal 3-D shapes. We now propose to extend our approach beyond static objects. When objects change shape (e.g. by bending, coiling, or contracting) as they move (e.g. walk, tumble, crawl, hop, slide, or swim), changes in the retinal image create patterns of local velocities that provide additional cues to 3-D shape. Since any retinal image can result from projections of many different 3-D objects, the brain relies on prior assumptions to infer the correct shape. Previous studies have only looked at rigid objects and used shape inference models based either on the brain assuming that the object is rigid or that faster points are nearer. We will use novel stimuli that put these prior assumptions in conflict, and thus examine how the brain potentiates a prior. This section will culminate in a model for choosing between conflicting assumptions, something that is often required in perception and cognition. Next, we will use randomly deforming non-rigid 3-D waves to examine how global shape properties, e.g. symmetry, influence perceived object motions by selectively combining disparate outputs of motion sensitive neurons. These results will unveil interactions between the form and motion cortical systems. Finally, we will examine observers' percepts of dynamic shape changes that require more sophisticated analyses of retinal velocity patterns. Neurons in the motion sensitive cortical area MT respond to 1-D motion shear and compression/divergence, so we will extract these qualities and combine them into 2-D velocity patterns of divergence, rotation, and deformation. Neural filters formed by these patterns will be used to explain perceived changes in 3-D shapes. We will base our filters on responses of MT and later cortical neurons to our stimuli, measured in a parallel project. We will thus present the first neural model that can explain observers' percepts of both rigid and non-rigid textured objects. The performance of our model will be compared against the best computer-vision models on motion-capture data from real deforming objects. We expect this project to introduce new ideas, methods and results for understanding visual perception of 3-D shapes and its deficits in neurological patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously. This project will identify how the brain constructs correct and incorrect shape percepts of 3-D objects from texture and motion information. In addition, people with amblyopia, strabismus and convergence-insufficiency often have deficient stereo vision, so they find texture and motion information to be particularly useful in perceiving 3-D shapes, hence our work on separating velocity information into object motion, object shape, and shape deformation may be particularly useful to these people.                  Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.        The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.

"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.           The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors.

"Center for Cell Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systematic reconstruction of genetic and molecular circuits in mammalian cells remains a significant, large-scale and unsolved challenge in genomics. The urgency to address it is underscored by the sizeable number of GWAS-derived disease genes whose functions remain largely obscure, limiting our progress towards biological understanding and therapeutic intervention. Recent advances in probing and manipulating cellular circuits on a genomic scale open the way for the development of a systematic method for circuit reconstruction. Here, we propose a Center for Cell Circuits to develop the reagents, technologies, algorithms, protocols and strategies needed to reconstruct molecular circuits. Our preliminary studies chart an initial path towards a universal strategy, which we will fully implement by developing a broad and integrated experimental and computational toolkit. We will develop methods for comprehensive profiling, genetic perturbations and mesoscale monitoring of diverse circuit layers (Aim 1). In parallel, we will develop a computational framework to analyze profiles, derive provisional models, use them to determine targets for perturbation and monitoring, and evaluate, refine and validate circuits based on those experiments (Aim 2). We will develop, test and refine this strategy in the context of two distinct and complementary mammalian circuits. First, we will produce an integrated, multi-layer circuit of the transcriptional response to pathogens in dendritic cells (Aim 3) as an example ofan acute environmental response. Second, we will reconstruct the the circuit of chromatin factors and non-coding RNAs that control chromatin organization and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 4) as an example of the circuitry underlying stable cell states. These detailed datasets and models will reveal general principles of circuit organization, provide a resource for scientists in these two important fields, and allow computational biologists to test and develop algorithms. We will broadly disseminate our tools and methods to the community, enabling researchers to dissect any cell circuit of interest at unprecedented detail. Our work will open the way for reconstructing cellular circuits in human disease and individuals, to improve the accuracy of both diagnosis and treatment.       RELEVANCE:  While it is now possible to rapidly identify genes that contribute to human disease, it is remains a major challenge to explain how these genes work together to carry out their normal functions or cause disease.

"Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate seeks to become independent as a neuroscientist and to work at the interface between neuroscience and physics. The Sloan-Swartz Center at UCSF provides a unique opportunity to become immersed in neuroscience at its cutting edge. While the majority of her time will be spent in research, she will attend a range of systems neuroscience and computer vision courses. The immediate goals of her research are to develop an information-theoretic method that allows for a rigorous statistical analysis of neural responses to natural stimuli, which are non- Gaussian and have strong spatiotemporal correlations; and to use this method to analyze the responses of visual cortical neurons to natural time-varying images. There are numerous indications that the responses of neurons to natural stimuli cannot be completely predicted from their responses to stimuli with simple statistical properties, such as white noise ensembles. However, existing methods for analyzing single neuron responses may be rigorously applied only to Gaussian ensembles. The information-theoretic method involves finding the stimulus dimensions that carry the most information about the neuron's response. The stimulus ensemble is not assumed to be Gaussian. The only assumption made is that the neuron is selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of the high-dimensional stimulus space: responses with respect to the relevant dimensions might be arbitrarily nonlinear. After testing the method on model neurons and verifying that it gives reasonable results for cortical neurons probed by natural scenes, the method will be used to test the categorical distinction between simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex. The method will then be modified so that a large set of directions related to each other via certain symmetry operations, such as translation or scaling, can be simultaneously found, with the goal of systematically probing neurons in extrastriate areas with natural scenes. n/a",Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli,7418710,K25MH068904,"['Accidents', 'Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Area', 'Area Analyses', 'Auditory', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Drug Formulations', 'Ear', 'Felis catus', 'Fire - disasters', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Physics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rotation', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'indium arsenide', 'interest', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'size', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector', 'voltage']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K25,2008,97809,0.027374027068916076
"CRCNS: Info. Process. & Neuronal Coordination: Neocortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain dysfunctions underlying schizophrenia are poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is likely that a critical aspect of this disease is a breakdown of the normal information processing functions of the neuronal assemblies. This project would study the activity of neuronal populations in sensory neocortex and investigate how neuronal assembly activity is disrupted in the dissociative anesthetic (PCP) model of schizophrenia.      Experimental investigation of this question will require recording large numbers of cells in functioning neural circuits. However, obtaining this data is only the beginning: the computational and statistical machinery to draw meaningful conclusions from such data must also be developed. Here we propose a collaborative research project between a mathematician (Kenneth Harris) and an electrophysiologist (Gyorgy Buzsaki), with the aim of recording, analyzing, and modeling the activity of large neuronal populations in primary sensory cortex and its disruption by psychotomimetic drugs. The project will rely on two techniques we have developed over the last years: large-scale neuronal recordings using silicon microelectrodes; and the data analysis method of peer prediction. The use of silicon probes will allow for estimation of the location of recorded cells, identification of monosynaptic connections between cell pairs, and characterization of neurons as pyramidal cells or interneurons. Experimentally identified assembly structure will be interpreted in the context of this circuit-level information.

"CRCNS: Info. Process. & Neuronal Coordination: Neocortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain dysfunctions underlying schizophrenia are poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is likely that a critical aspect of this disease is a breakdown of the normal information processing functions of the neuronal assemblies. This project would study the activity of neuronal populations in sensory neocortex and investigate how neuronal assembly activity is disrupted in the dissociative anesthetic (PCP) model of schizophrenia.      Experimental investigation of this question will require recording large numbers of cells in functioning neural circuits. However, obtaining this data is only the beginning: the computational and statistical machinery to draw meaningful conclusions from such data must also be developed. Here we propose a collaborative research project between a mathematician (Kenneth Harris) and an electrophysiologist (Gyorgy Buzsaki), with the aim of recording, analyzing, and modeling the activity of large neuronal populations in primary sensory cortex and its disruption by psychotomimetic drugs. The project will rely on two techniques we have developed over the last years: large-scale neuronal recordings using silicon microelectrodes; and the data analysis method of peer prediction. The use of silicon probes will allow for estimation of the location of recorded cells, identification of monosynaptic connections between cell pairs, and characterization of neurons as pyramidal cells or interneurons. Experimentally identified assembly structure will be interpreted in the context of this circuit-level information.      We will investigate the hypothesis that psychotomimetic effects of low doses of dissociative anesthetics are caused by a partial distortion in assembly organization, whereas larger doses cause a more complete distortion resulting anesthesia. If reliable signatures of psychotomimetic doses on assembly structure are found, this will suggest a novel method of drug screening for antipsychotics, whereby candidate drugs are evaluated by their ability to reverse these signatures. n/a",CRCNS: Info.

"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown.

Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal.

"COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Abstract)                                                                                                                              The broad objective of this proposal is to establish a quantitative              algorithmic link between cellular and molecular events involved in reward        processing and the behaviors that these events influence.  In particular, we     will focus on the nature and use of information that midbrain dopamine           systems construct and distribute to neural structures throughout the brain.      The activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral segmental area and               substantia nigra has long been identified with the processing of rewarding       stimuli.  These neurons send axons to brain structures involved in               motivation and goal directed behavior.  These same dopamine systems are          targets for disruption by disease and by drugs of abuse like heroine and         cocaine.  In alert primates, experiments show that the outputs of these          neurons encode errors between the predictions of future rewards and actual       times and magnitudes of future rewards.  The prediction errors are               apparently encoded as changes in the instantaneous spiking rates:  values        above baseline mean that the current state is 'better than predicted',           values below mean that the current state is 'worse than predicted', and no       difference means that 'things are as predicted'.  We have developed a            computational model of the behavior of midbrain dopamine neurons using a         method of adaptive optimizing control called the method of temporal              differences.  The model is consistent with electrophysiological and              behavioral data in monkeys, and also provably executes the appropriate           computational function of determining which actions maximize long-term           rewards.  The long term goal of this project is to provide a computational       connection between the action of dopaminergic mechanisms at the molecular        and cellular level and the consequences of these mechanisms on behaviors         observed in drug addiction.  Three approaches will be used to accomplish         this long term goal:  (1) human behavioral experiments, (2) mathematical         analysis, and (3) computer simulations of virtual creatures in complex           environments.

Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network        and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical           diseases.

"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6331594,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' corticofugal system', ' electrodes', ' electronic recording system', ' laboratory rat', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' neuroregulation', ' sensory discrimination', ' solitary tract nucleus', ' somesthetic sensory cortex', ' stimulus /response', ' thalamic nuclei', ' touch', ' trigeminal nerve', ' vibrissae', ' wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,358050,0.0890519570816944

"COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Abstract)                                                                                                                              The broad objective of this proposal is to establish a quantitative              algorithmic link between cellular and molecular events involved in reward        processing and the behaviors that these events influence.  In particular, we     will focus on the nature and use of information that midbrain dopamine           systems construct and distribute to neural structures throughout the brain.      The activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral segmental area and               substantia nigra has long been identified with the processing of rewarding       stimuli.  These neurons send axons to brain structures involved in               motivation and goal directed behavior.  These same dopamine systems are          targets for disruption by disease and by drugs of abuse like heroine and         cocaine.  In alert primates, experiments show that the outputs of these          neurons encode errors between the predictions of future rewards and actual       times and magnitudes of future rewards.  The prediction errors are               apparently encoded as changes in the instantaneous spiking rates:  values        above baseline mean that the current state is 'better than predicted',           values below mean that the current state is 'worse than predicted', and no       difference means that 'things are as predicted'.  We have developed a            computational model of the behavior of midbrain dopamine neurons using a         method of adaptive optimizing control called the method of temporal              differences.  The model is consistent with electrophysiological and              behavioral data in monkeys, and also provably executes the appropriate           computational function of determining which actions maximize long-term           rewards.  The long term goal of this project is to provide a computational       connection between the action of dopaminergic mechanisms at the molecular        and cellular level and the consequences of these mechanisms on behaviors         observed in drug addiction.  Three approaches will be used to accomplish         this long term goal:  (1) human behavioral experiments, (2) mathematical         analysis, and (3) computer simulations of virtual creatures in complex           environments.  These three methods will focus on the function of                 dopaminergic systems in the primate and will be used to probe how normal         mechanisms for making decisions in the face of rewards can be disrupted in       addiction.                                                                        n/a",COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD,6174750,R01DA011723,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' decision making', ' dopamine', ' drug addiction', ' electrophysiology', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' reinforcer']",NIDA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2000,154327,0.04216428443719245
"Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery At the end of 2020, the IARPA MICrONS program will conclude with an automated reconstruction of all neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex, along with the neurons’ synaptic connectivity and calcium-imaged responses to video stimuli. We believe that this dataset could become the most widely used resource in the field of cortical circuits, but more work is required to realize this potential. We propose to create an online community called Pyr (pronounced “peer”) that takes the result of MICrONS as its starting point. We propose to detect and correct the remaining errors in the automated segmentation through automated algorithms and human proofreading working in tandem. Automated error detection and correction will utilize hand-designed heuristics as well as deep learning and deep metric learning. Proofreading will be crowdsourced to nonscientist volunteers, a concept pioneered by Eyewire, but updated to handle a 1000x larger dataset and far more accurate artificial intelligence. We expect that Pyr will generate more cortical connections than any previous study, by orders of magnitude. This information will be accompanied by calcium-imaged visual responses of 80,000 neurons. With such an enormous and rich dataset, the primary bottleneck will become scientific discovery. We propose to crowdsource discovery by assembling a community of researchers who collaborate with Pyr and each other. Discovery infrastructure will include a “Science API” that allows programmatic access to the primary and derived data through Python functions, an automated system for “materializing” the connectome that makes the result of proofreading available to researchers with essentially zero delay, and a versioning system will insure that analyses are reproducible. We will create a framework enabling the community to contribute their own kinds of annotations, which will be included in materialization. Finally, we will build interactive discovery tools that couple Science API queries with visualization. We envision a community of researchers who will build upon the above discovery infrastructure, creating and sharing analysis tools of their own. They will investigate diverse questions about cortical structure and function, including many that we cannot foresee at all. In the future, Pyr could incorporate other cortical datasets as they become available, with much less engineering effort than the original MICrONS dataset. As with MICrONS, software will be developed in the open in public github repos. This software could be reused by others to build systems similar to Pyr. This project will create Pyr, an online community that makes scientific discoveries about cortical structure and function by reconstructing and analyzing the connections between neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse cortex along with the activity of the same neurons. Pyr will provide fundamental knowledge about normal function of the cortex, which is expected to be useful when studying mouse models of mental disorders.",Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery,10025901,RF1MH123400,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Caring', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Continuing Education', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Mus', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Training', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive load', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'heuristics', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'online community', 'peer', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'visual coding', 'volunteer']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,6000000,0.031605666078065205
"Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function. Project Narrative Our movements are shaped by sensory information, and though much progress has been made in understanding how proprioceptors (muscle sensory neurons) shape motor function, much less is known about how touch receptors (skin sensory neurons) influence motor pathways. To generate a complete picture of how sensory information affects motor actions, this project incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to provide a functional roadmap of how skin touch receptors interact with spinal cord motor centers to shape movement. By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function affected by disease or injury.",Touching on locomotion: an anatomical and functional analysis of spinal cord circuits that shape the way we move,10094597,R01NS119268,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Extensor', 'Flexor', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Hindlimb', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lateral', 'Length', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor Pathways', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Proprioceptor', 'Quality of life', 'Reflex action', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Skin', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord posterior horn', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cutaneous sensory neurons', 'electrical property', 'genetic approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'motor behavior', 'motor function improvement', 'mouse genetics', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'vibration']",NINDS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,433281,0.07985237860797144
"Understanding Multi-Layer Learning in a Biological Circuit Work on learning in neural systems has focused largely on the effects of plasticity at synapses that provide direct input to the neurons being studied. Learning a model of the environment or a complex skill, however, relies on plasticity that is widely distributed and may occur at synapses far from the neurons driving decisions or actions. As is well-known from multi-layer (or 'deep') artificial networks, distributing learning over multiple layers is substantially more powerful but also more difficult to implement than learning at a single layer. The fact that computer scientists have solved such problems has revolutionized artificial intelligence and is rapidly reshaping the human world. Understanding how the brain solves such problems is, undoubtedly, one of the biggest challenges facing neuroscience today. However, progress along these lines has been slow, due in part to the high degree of complexity of learning and memory circuits in mammals, such as hippocampus and neocortex, that have been a major focus of research. This proposal applies integrated experimental and theoretical approaches to a system with unique advantages for understanding learning in multi-layer networks. The electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish is the site of a continual learning process that predicts and cancels self-generated sensory input in order to enhance detection of behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Building on this knowledge, we propose to develop a model of the ELL spanning from cellular biophysics to network dynamics with the goal of explaining how synaptic plasticity widely distributed across processing layers and cell types gives rise to learning. To accomplish this, we will leverage cutting-edge approaches for mapping synaptic connectivity at high-resolution and monitoring neural population activity over the entire time course of learning. The proposed research is expected to yield general insight into how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits. This proposal seeks to understand how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits. To do this we will apply cutting-edge approaches for measuring activity in neuronal populations, mapping circuitry at high-resolution, and theoretical modeling to an advantageous model system—the weakly electric mormryid fish. The research will produce a detailed computational model, spanning from biophysical to network levels, of how learning arises from synaptic plasticity that is widely distributed across processing layers and cell types.",Understanding Multi-Layer Learning in a Biological Circuit,10053457,R01NS118448,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mormyridae', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'skills']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1521512,0.03530912915113807
"Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila. Project Summary/Abstract There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how complex, multi-action, behavioral variability is generated by neural circuits in the brain. Understanding this process is crucial to understanding how many neurological diseases cause restricted and inappropriate selection of actions. The goal of this proposal is to understand how populations of neurons control the behavioral variability in action selection for complex behaviors. We will utilize the fruit fly to investigate this question because despite having a much simpler brain than humans, the fruit fly performs complex behaviors with high variability. We have found that activating just 24 neurons in the fruit fly brain causes variable expression of four distinct aggressive actions: stopping, wing elevation, leg extension, and lunging. The relative simplicity of this system is ideal for pin-pointing the contribution of different sources of variability: cell-autonomous stochasticity in action potential generation, variability at a network-level or variability in muscles or other neurons affected by the 24 neurons. To test these sources for variability, the project will consist of three main aims. The first is to determine whether the actions are discrete states of behavior or lie within a continuum by using advances in machine learning and neuroethology to automate the identification of the aggressive behavioral actions and the transitions between these actions. The second is to test the hypothesis that each action is caused by neurons with similar neuroanatomical connections using neuroimaging, genetic manipulation, and controlled behavioral experiments. The third is to use functional imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and computational modeling to determine the neural basis for the variability of behavior. By combining theory, experimentation, and modeling, we will be able to provide a systems level explanation of the logic behind why animals perform different actions despite consistent levels of neuronal activation. Project Narrative The ability to flexibly and appropriately perform action selection is altered in many neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, the mechanism behind the variability in action selection while performing complex behaviors is not understood. By quantifying, modeling, and decoding the neural logic behind the variability in action selection of a fruit fly, we aim to build new theories about how our own brain works and provide insight into better treatment of diseases affecting proper execution of behaviors.",Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila.,10157174,F31NS120835,"['Action Potentials', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Functional Imaging', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Wing', 'Work', 'appendage', 'base', 'deep neural network', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'insight', 'male', 'markov model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroethology', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'peanut butter', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.03217224924070543
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,9984554,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,384007,0.08357092648016018
"Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior ABSTRACT Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain. Exploratory behaviors are necessary for rodent survival in the natural world and ubiquitous in freely-moving rodent experiments. One neural circuit that may mediate natural exploratory behaviors are the projections from prelimbic cortex (PL, part of rodent prefrontal cortex) to ventral tegmental area (VTA). Stimulation of PL-VTA projections causes increased velocity but is not rewarding, despite the well-known rewarding effect of direct stimulation of VTA-dopamine neurons. Taken together with the fact that VTA has been implicated in exploration, my central hypothesis is that PL-VTA neurons mediate natural exploratory behaviors through downstream effects on a subpopulation of non-dopaminergic VTA neurons. To investigate this hypothesis, I will first develop an unbiased, machine-learning-based method to quantify untrained, freely-moving mouse behaviors (Experiment 1.1). My method will leverage multi-view, high resolution video, supervised body part tracking, and unsupervised machine learning-based postural clustering methods. I will use this method to identify which specific behaviors (rearing, walking, grooming, sniffing, etc.) are affected by optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of PL-VTA cells in the presence and absence of rewards (Experiment 1.2). Preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility of my behavioral quantification method and suggests that PL-VTA stimulation increases exploratory behaviors. Next, to identify the genetically- and target-defined VTA cells that are preferentially synapsed onto by PL projections, I will use a combination of optogenetics, in vitro electrophysiology, transgenic mice, and retrograde tracing. First, I will use transgenic mice to measure the functional strength of PL input specifically onto VTA cells that are dopaminergic, GABAergic, or glutamatergic (Experiment 2.1). In a different set of mice, I will use retrograde tracing to identify if PL synapses preferentially onto VTA cells that project to nucleus accumbens or amygdala (Experiment 2.2). After learning which genetic and target-defined VTA subpopulations receive PL input, I will use retrograde tracing in combination with transgenic labeling to identify specifically which genetically and projection-defined VTA subpopulation receives PL input (Experiment 2.3). Finally, I will use a retrograde cre-dependent virus to selectively infect this VTA subpopulation with ChR2 and use my behavioral quantification pipeline to investigate whether in vivo stimulation of this subpopulation recapitulates the exploratory effects of PL-VTA stimulation (Experiment 2.4). Thus, the project proposed will develop a novel method for quantifying naturalistic behavior and integrate this computational method with diverse experimental methods, including in vivo and in vitro optogenetics, natural behavior, and synaptic physiology. These experiments will contribute novel information on how the PL-VTA circuit mediates naturalistic motor output, independent of the reinforcement effects of VTA-dopamine activity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain, but until recently methods for quantifying spontaneous behavior have been limited. I will develop a novel computational method for assessing how naturalistic exploratory behaviors are mediated by a subset of prefrontal cortex cells and the midbrain cells onto which they synapse. In total, this project will combine computational and experimental methods to map prefrontal-midbrain circuit and identify its effects on natural exploratory behavior.",Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior,10146550,F32MH125546,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Dopaminergic Cell', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Motor output', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Running', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'Synapses', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Walking', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cell cortex', 'cell type', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69926,0.03034873532145952
"Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue Abstract  How is connectivity between neurons related to patterns of activity exhibited by these neurons in vivo? This question of structure-function relations in brain circuits is of fundamental importance. Answering it in a quantitative manner would have far-reaching consequences both for our theories of how brain works and for applications ranging from better disease treatments to new tools for artificial intelligence. However, our current understanding of structure-function relations is relatively poor, in large part because the fine structure of neuronal connectivity has remained largely unknown. In turn, this severely limits connecting modeling to theoretical efforts. This problem is particularly challenging in the case of studying the highly heterogeneous cortical circuits, which are involved in important functions like perception, cognition, and learning.  Fortunately, recent experimental work by our collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science is now resulting in transformational new datasets that characterize connectivity in the mouse cortical area V1 at the level of Cell Types using multi-patch synaptic physiology and at the level of individual neurons using electron microscopy (EM). For the first time in history of neuroscience, we will have connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in ~1 mm3 of V1, plus systematic characterization of synaptic properties.  We will leverage these unique datasets to build and share with the community new models of V1 and use them to study the relationships between cortical connectivity and in vivo activity and computations. We will analyze how multiple features of neuronal code depend on individual cell properties and on higher-order connectivity motifs, which are present in the EM connectome, but not in the statistics-based connectivity inferred from sparse measurements at the Cell Types level or from existing literature. We also will evaluate the consistency of the new models of V1 with predictions made by current theories of structure-function relations.  These models and simulations will be freely shared with the community as a resource that scientists will use to guide future experiment designs, improve biological realism in models, and assist in generating and testing theories. By providing a rich and biologically realistic framework for new theoretical, modeling, and experimental studies, this resource will fuel new discoveries regarding relations between the structure and function of cortical circuits. To improve our understanding of the healthy brain as well as what breaks down in disease, it is essential to develop a quantitative, mechanistic description of how properties of neurons and their connections determine the properties of neural activity in vivo. This project will take advantage of unprecedented experimental datasets from the Allen Institute for Brain Science that contain a systematic characterization of synaptic connections between the cell types present and a connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in the mouse visual cortex. We propose to integrate these data into new, highly realistic network models of cortical circuits, use the models to explore theoretical predictions, and provide them as a resource to fuel future theoretical, modeling, and experimental work in the community.",Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue,10005712,R01EB029813,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'base', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,ALLEN INSTITUTE,R01,2020,600000,0.060465554282836925
"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",9984552,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Postural adjustments', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2020,579461,0.07487034228972012
"Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by partial or complete loss of acquired spoken language, acquired motor skills and stereotypic hand movements. Mutations in X-linked gene methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), a chromatin remodeler and gene regulator, is the causative gene for typical RTT. RTT is hypothesized to be the result of altered synaptic connectivity and plasticity caused by abnormal experience-dependent synapse development and maintenance. However, few experimental paradigms have explored how synaptic plasticity in RTT is affected over time and physiological changes with cellular, circuit and behavioral level granularity. Using Mecp2-null and heterozygous mouse models, we have previously shown that MECP2 regulates the timing of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult auditory cortex in a learned maternal behavior paradigm. We found that Mecp2-heterozygous females (SurHet) were inefficient gatherers, likely due to atypical auditory perception, caused by an abnormal, transient increase in numbers of mature perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are extracellular matrix structures that act as physical barriers for plasticity, and form predominantly around cortical parvalbumin GABAergic neurons. Major questions remain: Pup retrieval behavior is a complex sequence of events involving auditory, tactile, olfactory senses and goal-directed motor events. How do different sensory inputs (pup vocalizations, feel and smell of pups) contribute to the motor outputs (adult vocalizations, goal-directed search and carrying pups by mouth to the nest)? Our aims in this R15 proposal are to (1) characterize vocalizations/syllables and interactions between pups and adult females during pup gathering task, using integrated analysis of audio and video recordings with new machine learning algorithms; (2) identify the time line of altered PNN expression in piriform cortex, a brain region thought to be important for olfactory coding and a relay station for multisensory integration using immunostaining/imaging and then, surgical manipulations of piriform cortex. We hypothesize that expression of mature PNNs in the piriform cortex is regulated by MECP2 and contribute to proper integration and functioning of distinct components of pup retrieval behavior. The results from this study aims to identify novel circuits and mechanisms involved in multisensory integration of vocal communication during complex social behavior, which are one of the most striking yet underexplored phenotypes in RTT. Relevance to health: Rett Syndrome is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder with sensory, motor and social impairments; however, it is currently unknown where and how these impairments develop and change over time in adulthood. This proposal aims to understand how plasticity, the ability of the brain to incorporate and adapt to changes in its environment and surroundings, is affected by mutated genes in RTT and associated neurological disorders. Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). The overall goal is to determine how MECP2 deficiency results in altered experience-dependent plasticity, critical for learning and navigating one's social environment, and to observed stereotypic RTT phenotypes.",Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication.,10045956,R15MH124042,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Tactile', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Ultrasonics', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'deep learning algorithm', 'differential expression', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'girls', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'middle age', 'motor control', 'mouse model', 'multisensory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'piriform cortex', 'programs', 'pup', 'sensory input', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social communication', 'stereotypy', 'undergraduate student', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R15,2020,450753,0.03398253902752586
"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,10012952,K99NS114179,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Closure by clamp', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Wind', 'Esthesia', 'Failure', 'Fingers', 'Flying body movement', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Odors', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Walking', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'goal oriented behavior', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory stimulus', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2020,134007,0.0640004830268399
"Intelligent connectomic analysis tool for dense neuronal circuits Intelligent Connectomic Analysis Tool for Dense Neuronal Circuits Project Summary: The lack of basic understanding of neuronal functions and disease processes is a big factor of failures in creating drugs for neurological diseases. High-resolution maps of the complex connectivity of neuronal circuits correlating with functional and/or molecular markers offer invaluable insights into the functional organization of the neuronal structures, which is a key to understanding the brain in health and disease.

The ultimate goal is to elucidate human brain functions and the mechanisms of human brain disorders. This is critically important to enable new diagnostics and therapies for brain disorders.

"A new mechanistic and technological framework for uncovering the spinal cord neural systems important for functional recovery after injury Project Summary and Abstract Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is known about the neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. Sensory based rehabilitation suggests a strong link between cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory neuron activity and motor recovery. Previous experiments provide strong support for the intermediate zone (IZ) of the spinal cord (SC) as an important site mediating this recovery. However, few studies have assessed the role of specific IZ neurons in functional recovery. Key barriers to progress include lack of characterization of specific cell types within the IZ and a paucity of tools to visualize circuits and test their functions in motor performance and recovery following SCI. Our lab combines sophisticated mouse genetic approaches with sensitive motor movement tracking to understand how sensory information is encoded by the SC to influence behavior. Using this approach, we uncovered that intermediate zone (IZ) parvalbumin positive interneurons (PVs) are important for tactile motor responses and locomotion. We hypothesize that IZ-PVs process sensory information to activate specific muscle groups during locomotion and that they play a critical role in activity-based functional recovery following SCI. The ability to identify circuits important for functional recovery relies on how accurately we can quantify differences in behavioral outcomes. We are implementing an unsupervised approach using 3-D pose dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize both sensitive behavioral biomarkers and uncover key spinal cord circuits important for the recovery process. Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration are improving, and this project both identifies the neural systems and synaptic mechanisms that would be most effective to target such interventions and establishes an AI-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased quantification of motor recovery in rodents. Thus, this project makes original and important contributions to the field of spinal cord research in ways that are specifically aligned with central missions of the NINDS. Moreover, our experimental scrutiny at both the neural and behavioral levels establishes a critical foundation for developing a leading research program and securing independent award funding studying the spinal cord circuits important for sensorimotor function and recovery following SCI. To this end, I have developed a thorough and pragmatic career development plan supported by a strong committee of mentors with extensive track records of laboratory and departmental level mentoring and distinguished portfolios of SCI-specific grant support from the NIH, DoD and private foundations. My career development activities will be focused on four aspects of my academic success. 1) Mentorship and guidance focused on laboratory management. 2) Development and growth of my independent research program and award funding, with a focus on SCI research gap-based training. 3) Navigating institutional responsibilities and fulfilling requirements for promotion and tenure. 4) Expanding my scientific network and profile. Project Narrative Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is known about the spinal cord neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. This project both identifies the spinal cord neural cell types and synaptic mechanisms that would be most effective to target such interventions and establishes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased quantification of motor recovery in rodents.

"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting movements and postures. Although basal ganglia dysfunction is consistently implicated across many forms of dystonia, the underlying pathophysiology is unknown. The major input structure of the basal ganglia is the striatum. The vast majority of neurons in the striatum are GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal pallidum (GPi) to promote movement. Indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum (GPe) to inhibit movement. Although dSPNs and dSPNs are largely segregated into separate pathways, they act in concert and within ensembles of coactivity to select and refine movements. In dystonia patients, this coordinated activity appears to be disrupted as microelectrode recordings in dystonia patients reveal abnormal activity in both GPi and GPe. Although these results implicate abnormal activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs, the abnormal patterns of striatal activity that mediate dystonia are unknown. Several challenges have stymied our ability to understand the abnormal neural code underlying dystonia. First, the information obtained from microelectrode recording in patients is, by necessity, quite limited. Second, because dystonia is induced by movement, recordings must be made in awake unrestrained subjects to obtain authentic results. Third, to meaningfully understand striatal pathophysiology, it is necessary to distinguish between dSPNs and iSPNs, which is challenging to accomplish using microelectrode recordings in vivo because these two distinct cells types are intermingled within the striatum. With the recent development of lightweight miniature fluorescence microscopes that can be used to image the activity of genetically-identified SPNs in freely moving mice, we can overcome these obstacles to understand the physiological substrates of dystonia. For the first experiments to reveal abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia, we will use a knockin mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) in which the striatum is known to play a central role in mediating the dystonia. In fact, both dSPN and iSPN signaling is disrupted in these mice. Thus, we now have an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the neural code of dystonia for the first time. The Specific Aim is to identify abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia. We will test the hypothesis that dystonia is mediated by abnormal neuronal activity and degraded ensemble activity of dSPNs and iSPNs by performing in vivo Ca2+ imaging in freely moving normal or DRD mice that selectively express the GCaMP6f calcium indicator in either dSPNs or iSPNs. Abnormal firing patterns including the degree of spatial clustering of coactive neurons will be assessed using both well-established approaches and a novel analysis of population dynamics using a machine learning algorithm that we recently developed to identify and predict dystonia-specific neuronal ensemble firing patterns. Although dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after tremor and Parkinson’s disease, treatments for dystonia are inadequate because the underlying neuronal dysfunction is not well understood. Understanding abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia will provide a novel platform for the development of therapeutics that target the abnormal neural code, rather than the traditional one-drug-one-target approach.!",Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia,9957592,R21NS116311,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopa-Responsive Dystonia', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine D1 Receptor', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor', 'Dopamine Receptor', 'Dystonia', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Human', 'Image', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Dynamics', 'Posture', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'awake', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence microscope', 'in vivo', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,427605,0.021150841533175705
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain Abstract Neural circuits composed of interconnected neurons with distinct properties lay the physical foundation of any brain function. Identifying connections between individual neurons is central to understand how information is processed and propagated in the brain. While emerging high throughput light microscopy technologies are highly promising in allowing whole brain scale imaging at the single cell level, optical resolution limitation prevents their use in differentiating densely labeled neuronal processes in the same brain. In addition, computational tools for automatically extracting morphological information from intermingled neurons with high accuracy are still lacking. Our team will concurrently develop novel genetic tools for neuronal labeling, super-resolution imaging, and automated neuronal tracing for high-throughput circuit reconstruction. We will apply these tools to obtain densely reconstructed inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex. These tools will be readily applicable for studying other long-standing questions in neuroscience and the resources generated by this project will be useful for future computational tool development. Narrative Neuronal morphology is an important attribute for characterizing neural developmental and degenerative diseases. Abnormal dendritic and/or axonal arbors indicate disfunction in neuronal activity and connectivity. Automated reconstruction of neural circuit from a densely labeled brain remains a technical challenge as the intermingled neuronal processes result in many ambiguities when they appear as running into each other in a light microscopy image. We will develop an integrative strategy, which combines advanced labeling, sample preparing, imaging and computing techniques to permit automated microconnectivity analysis in regular neurobiology labs. Our study on inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex will greatly advance the fundamental knowledge about how inhibition is formed. This is highly relevant to the circuitry mechanism of Autism Spectrum Disorder and many other neural disorder diseases, which are caused by an excitation-inhibition imbalance in the brain.","Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain",10025817,RF1MH123402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Cre driver', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'anatomic imaging', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'learning network', 'light microscopy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,RF1,2020,2900000,0.03147966887844144
"Towards elucidation of circuit mechanisms for feeding-related manual dexterity PROJECT SUMMARY Dexterous food-handling is a critical but still poorly understood type of basic motor behavior. We propose an exploratory research program to investigate how the mouse uses its digits and forepaws to dexterously handle food. Preliminary results suggest that mouse food-handling movements, despite appearing extremely complex, can be decomposed into several types of simpler elements, tentatively identified as distinct and very rapid submovements that exhibit partly stereotyped and partly variable kinematic features. They also suggest that the mouse’s thumb (first digit, or D1; pollex) plays a surprisingly large and previously unrecognized role in dexterous food-handling. To explore these hypotheses and observations, we will first develop an approach for quantitatively characterizing seed-handling behaviors of freely moving mice. For this we will use high-speed, close-up video capture, combined with deep neural network methods for automated markerless tracking (DeepLabCut). We will then develop a novel trial-based paradigm for characterizing seed-handling under the more experimentally controlled conditions of head-fixation. We will combine this approach with tools for optogenetic silencing of either selectively targeted cortical areas or selectively labeled corticospinal neurons in motor cortex, as well as multi- probe/multi-channel linear array recordings of spiking activity in key nodes along sensorimotor pathways. Collectively this work will advance our understanding of the elemental movements involved in the dexterous manipulation of food, providing new insights into this process in a genetically tractable model organism, and opening the way for future studies to dissect the cellular mechanisms in sensorimotor circuits mediating specific aspects of forelimb and digit motor control. NARRATIVE The proposed research on dexterous forelimb behavior is directly relevant to public health because pathology in the neural circuits that mediate these behaviors severely impairs motor control. By elucidating fundamental aspects of these behaviors in a model mammalian organism, the mouse, this research can lead to new treatments of disease, and is thus relevant to those aspects of the NIH mission aimed at improving health through understanding pathophysiological mechanisms in disorders causing disability.",Towards elucidation of circuit mechanisms for feeding-related manual dexterity,9982480,R21NS116886,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Fingers', 'Food', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Kinesiology', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Mastication', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Oral cavity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Sensory', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Thumb structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep neural network', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'free behavior', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,434500,0.038573640534286704
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown.

"Combining Physiological, Genetic, and Computational Approaches with Naturalistic Climbing Behavior to Elucidate the Functional Elements of Descending Motor Control PROJECT SUMMARY Many mammals are distinguished by the exceptional diversity and agility of their limb movement. These qualities are critical to the fitness certain movements confer, and so to the evolutionary success of many species. While brain regions important for limb control have been identified, the neural signal processing that ultimately governs motor commands sent to muscles has remained stubbornly opaque. Mechanistic models of motor system operation in real time during movement are thus lacking. This obscures the etiology of motor deficits caused by neurological disease and stroke, which in turn stymies the development of effective treatments.  A primary cause of this opacity of motor system processing is the ambiguity of the basic functional elements comprising relevant neural circuits. An emerging view posits that these elements may be neuronal subtypes defined by features like axonal target region, target cell identity, and gene expression. Yet the fundamental question of what are the appropriate cellular features for defining functional units remains unanswered. This ambiguity stems from a host of technical limitations. We expect that functionally salient neuronal subtypes will make characteristic contributions to specific phases of movement. Yet traditional methods for silencing neural activity to assess function lack the temporal resolution to discern such specific influence. We also expect that functionally salient subtypes will exhibit distinct activity patterns and interactions with other neuronal populations. But classical methods for measuring neural firing are typically blind to key cellular features. Moreover, the behavioral paradigms used for motor system studies have not captured essential aspects of natural mammalian movement, for which motor system organization may have been adapted over evolution.  Fortunately though, systems neuroscience is currently being revolutionized by advances in physiological, genetic, and computational techniques. I plan to leverage many of these advances and pursue an innovative approach to resolve the basic functional elements within a model motor system population – the subcerebral projection neurons (SPNs) found in motor areas of the neocortex. We will employ a naturalistic climbing paradigm for mice engineered in my lab to overcome limitations of previous motor behavior paradigms. New genetically- mediated targeting strategies will provide access to potential functional subtypes for activity measurement and perturbation. We will novelly couple optogenetic probes, electromyography, and automated behavior decomposition to distinguish precise phases of neuronal subtype influence. Large-scale, multi-area activity recording, optogenetic identification, and machine learning will parse subtypes by their activity and interactions with other neuronal populations. Our work will articulate an interdisciplinary approach applicable to the fundamental question of functional units in other neural systems as well. The mechanistic insight our work begins to build will help elucidate the etiology of movement deficits stemming from conditions like ALS and Huntington’s disease, and following stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project aims to identify basic functional elements within motor circuits to help build mechanistic models of motor system operation in real time during movement execution. The lack of such models has sharply limited our understanding of the etiology of motor deficits stemming from neurological disease and stroke, which in turn stymies the development of effective treatment. The mechanistic insight our work builds will thus help elucidate the etiology of motor deficits and facilitate improved treatment.","Combining Physiological, Genetic, and Computational Approaches with Naturalistic Climbing Behavior to Elucidate the Functional Elements of Descending Motor Control",10002981,DP2NS120847,"['Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Computational Technique', 'Development', 'Electromyography', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Huntington Disease', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'blind', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'stem', 'success', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,DP2,2020,2340462,0.02127640580328522
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10005472,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,628430,0.053869610297311674
"Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit Abstract The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated, well-timed movements. The cerebellar cortex seems to have a particular role in learning to time movements. Since the 1960's and 70's, we have known the architecture of the cerebellar microcircuit, but most analyses of cerebellar function during behavior have focused on Purkinje cells. Here, we propose to investigate the cerebellar cortex at an entirely new level by asking how the full cerebellar microcircuit – mossy fiber, granule cells, Golgi cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells – performs neural computations during motor behavior and motor learning. We strive to “crack” the circuit by identifying all elements, recording their electrical activity during movement and learning, and reconstructing a neural circuit model that reproduces the biological data. We will use three established learning systems that all can learn predictive timing: classical conditioning of the eyelid response (mice), predictive timing of forelimb movements (mice), and direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements (monkeys). Our proposal has six key features. First, optogenetics (in mice) will link the discharge of different cerebellar interneurons during movement and learning to their molecular cell types. Second, a machine-learning clustering analysis (in mice and monkeys) will find analogies among the cell populations recorded in our three preparations and will classify neurons according to their putative cell types based on recordings of many parameters of non-Purkinje cells during movement and motor learning. Third, multi- contact electrodes will allow us to record simultaneously from multiple neighboring single neurons and compute spike-timing cross-correlograms (CCGs) to identify the sign of connections; we also will look for changes in CCGs that provide evidence of specific sites of plasticity during learning. Fourth, gCAMP imaging of the granule cell layer will reveal the temporal structure of inputs to the cerebellar microcircuit, and determine whether those inputs are modified in relation to motor learning. Fifth, a model neural network with realistic cerebellar architecture will reveal a single set of model parameters that will transform the measured inputs to the cerebellum in our three movement systems to the measured responses of all neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Sixth, the model will elucidate how mechanisms of synaptic and cellular plasticity at different sites in the cerebellar microcircuit work together to cause motor learning. Project Narrative The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated and well-timed movements. A better understanding of how the cerebellar circuit works and learns will be important for improving human health in cases of stroke, neuro-degenerative motor disease, developmental motor disorders, and adult movement disorders.",Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit,9976609,R01NS112917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brush Cell', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Forelimb', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smooth Pursuit', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'commune', 'design', 'experimental study', 'eyeblink conditioning', 'eyelid conditioning', 'granule cell', 'improved', 'learned behavior', 'mossy fiber', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1275271,0.03742661833185764
"Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury PROJECT SUMMARY Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes life-long neurological impairment, and there is currently no effective treatment. The premise of this proposal is recent work demonstrating that afferent stimulation paired with treadmill training can enhance standing, stepping, and volitional control in humans and animal models. Therefore, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms by which afferent stimulation drives motor improvement. Tools that can identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient to enhance recovery, and that can facilitate characterization of the helpful neural plasticity, are urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to develop approaches for selective afferent modulation, and apply them to the dissection of the mechanisms underlying recovery from SCI. The objective of this grant is to identify which sets of afferents are important for recovery and how spinal circuits change to facilitate it. To achieve selective modulation of afferents and enable genetic tracing we will use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) that can modulate excitability in specific populations of neurons. To accurately quantify improvement, we will use Deep Learning to analyze large kinematic data sets. Our preliminary data shows strong expression of DREADDs in large diameter DRG neurons, that their activation by CNO can excite or inhibit the H-reflex, and that activation of excitatory DREADDs during treadmill training post-SCI improves stepping. Our main hypothesis is that activation of large afferents by the excitatory DREADD (hM3Dq) during treadmill training will enhance recovery, whereas inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di) will suppress recovery. Four sub- hypotheses will test whether recovery is mediated by increased afferent projection onto 1) motor neurons, or 2) inhibitory interneurons; or by sprouting of 3) reticulospinal and 4) propriospinal circuits. Our Specific Aims are to determine whether selective expression of DREADDs in (Aim 1) all large diameter (proprioceptive and tactile) neurons and (Aim 2) large proprioceptive afferents only can enhance recovery. The rationale for these aims is that afferent stimulation is hypothesized to work through selective excitation of large diameter sensory afferents (LDSA) that both drive motor pools locally and facilitate proprio- and surpraspinal input. To date, it has not been possible to definitively determine which afferents were recruited after electrical stimulation, or to select between afferents of similar diameter. The significance of this work lies in determining whether recovery is mediated exclusively by proprioceptive axons or a combination of proprioceptive and tactile afferents, and uncovering the mechanisms of functional plasticity in the spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 300,000 individuals are living with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the USA without an effective treatment. Recently, spinal cord stimulation during rehabilitation has been found to enable better standing, stepping, and voluntary control in patients with SCI. This study will improve our understanding of these mechanisms by 1) using new genetic tools to identify which afferents are necessary and sufficient for improvement, and 2) using genetic tracing techniques to uncover how spinal circuits are changing to enhance function.",Chemogenetic afferent modulation to understand spinal cord circuit function and plasticity post injury,10051492,R01NS114007,"['Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Caliber', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dissection', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'H-Reflex', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Locomotor Recovery', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue', 'Outcome', 'Parvalbumins', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Contusions', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Synapses', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toes', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Volition', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'density', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'effective therapy', 'feeding', 'functional plasticity', 'human model', 'improved', 'injury recovery', 'kinematics', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'sensory input', 'tool', 'treadmill training', 'vector']",NINDS,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,416293,0.016912655786364698
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9904776,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'confocal imaging', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2020,538317,0.04436650155601332
"Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex Project Summary/Abstract: For animals to execute complicated behaviors, successful motor planning and execution is essential. Moreover, the sequence of events leading to successful goal-based behavior takes place over a wide range of timescales. For example, when walking from home to work, one must first make an abstract, long-timescale decision to go to work, which much then be translated into a sequence of shorter-timescale right-left turning decisions, which are translated into the finely fluctuating electrical patterns that control the muscles. How motor planning and execution occur simultaneously over many timescales in populations of motor cortex neurons is not well understood. Much work in humans and nonhuman primates have shown that visual and auditory stimuli integrate over multiple timescales. This work has shown that early sensory regions, like primary visual cortex, respond to fast fluctuations in the environment. This information is integrated to longer-timescale information in secondary cortical regions, with the longest- timescale information in frontal and association areas. We therefore hypothesize that secondary motor cortex (M2) neurons control behavior over longer timescales than primary motor cortex (M1) neurons. To study this phenomenon, I have built a setup in which head-fixed mice navigate in virtual reality to a rewarded location. In this setup, I can record video from all sides of the animal for high spatiotemporal resolution measurement of motor behaviors. I have developed machine learning algorithms to extract 3D pose data from these videos. In Aim 1, I will use calcium imaging to record large numbers of neurons in mouse M1 and M2 to correlate the activity of individual neurons and populations to the animal’s ongoing pose kinematics. We will supplement with targeted silicon probe recordings to capture fast neural responses. In Aim 2, I will compare the calcium dynamics in populations of M1 and M2 neurons in mice trained to perform a virtual motor planning task versus mice that have not been trained. We hypothesize that training to plan motor actions increases the timescale of M1/M2 neural activity. In Aim 3, we will use optogenetic silencing in specific regions of cortex to perturb the animal’s motor behavior. We hypothesize that the duration of the perturbed movements will be longer when M2 is perturbed than M1. In this way, we will study how different cortical regions relate to behavior over many timescales. This proposal will broaden our knowledge of cortical processing in general, and motor planning and execution in particular. Patients with mental illness, such as ADHD, autism, and Asperger’s disorder show impaired ability to plan upcoming movements. The first step to successfully treating these illnesses is to better understand how motor planning occurs in general. Project Narrative: This proposal will elucidate how motor planning and execution take place simultaneously, over many timescales, and across brain regions. Better understanding motor planning will help generate new treatments for diseases that affect motor planning, like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism.",Multiple timescales of motor planning and execution in mouse cortex,10007591,F31NS108450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Asperger Syndrome', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laser Scanning Microscopy', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Stereotyping', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'area striata', 'auditory stimulus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'frontal lobe', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'neuromechanism', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2020,33236,0.04376486751746573
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,9897551,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,403711,0.059397242349843976

"Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema, which is a common consequence of multiple brain insults, including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury, stroke, metabolic derangements, and seizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures, and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long- term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema, which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead to water accumulation during cytotoxic edema, a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries of the newborn, resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures. Once the pathways are identified, there is the potential for significant advancement in the treatment of neuronal swelling, which is currently lacking.

"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9930683,U19NS107466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2020,2983524,0.10274282637359386
"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease,9973904,R01AG064066,"['20 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Disorientation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mus', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'computational neuroscience', 'entorhinal cortex', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'neuron loss', 'non rapid eye movement', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'rapid eye movement', 'relating to nervous system', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep regulation', 'spatial memory', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'virtual environment', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'way finding']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,645926,-0.03709955552941636
"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined. This project aims to map these downstream functional circuit components using neuronal translabeling approaches and assess their contribution to precise, robust and flexible motor behavior in Drosophila.",Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking,9991417,F32MH123012,"['ARNT gene', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Chest', 'Cloning', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Nerve', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'mind control', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,73010,0.1045998650526821
"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,10015338,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'loss of function', 'motivated behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2020,126090,0.05931686876477267
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9983641,R01DA047869,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,279706,0.08051000192011921
"Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The integrated sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities that guide adaptive behavior in mammals emerge from neural circuit operations in the neocortex. Understanding the organization of cortical circuits requires comprehensive knowledge of the basic cellular components. The neocortex consists of approximately 80% glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and 20% GABAergic neurons. Although a minority, GABA interneurons are exceptionally diverse, and this diversity may be crucial in regulating the balance and functional operations of cortical circuits. However, systematic identification, enumeration and classification of GABAergic neurons have been a challenging goal. We hypothesize that distinct transcription programs underlie GABA prototype identity and diversity as defined by their position, morphology and basic innervation pattern. Thus we suggest that transcription profiling provides a fundamental starting point and efficient strategy for cell type discovery. Here we propose a multi-faceted approach that integrates genetic targeting, single cell transcriptomics, statistical and computational analysis, morpho-physiological studies to systematically identify and classify GABAergic neurons. We focus on GABA neurons derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which constitute two-third of cortical interneurons, and for which we have built effective genetic tools. We have established a robust single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) method that allows high resolution transcriptome profiling through single mRNA counting using nucleotide barcodes. We will take a two-step ""Targeted-Saturation"" cell screen approach toward systematic discovery of cortical GABA neurons. First, we will apply scRNAseq to a set of GABA subpopulations, captured by intersectional genetic targeting, and discover their distinct transcription signatures. With these phenotype- characterized populations, we hone our statistical analysis to distinguish biological signal vs experimental noise and artifacts, and shape our computation algorithm based on biological ground truth. Thus in contrast to a unsupervised clustering approach to transcriptome analysis, we incorporate extensive empirical information that enable a biology-motivated supervised approach, where well-delineated phenotypes play the key role of training the algorithm and classifier. Second, we will apply scRNASeq to increasingly broader genetic-defined populations of MGE-derived GABA neurons in the primary motor cortex. We will discover transcriptome-predicted cell types and build 2nd round driver lines that target and validate a subset of novel cell types. Our study will build a comprehensive catalog of a major cohort of cortical GABAergic neurons by integrating transcription profiles and basic cell phenotypes. This will establish a cellular foundation for studying inhibitory circuit organization, function, and dysfunction. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will combine genetic engineering, single cell gene expression profiling, computational analysis, anatomical and physiological approaches to systematically discover GABAergic cell types in the mouse neocortex. These studies will facilitate our understanding of the function of cortical neural circuits and yield insight into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. 1",Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex,9977809,R01MH109665,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth Order', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Embryo', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Medial', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genetic approach', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'molecular marker', 'nerve supply', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'online resource', 'operation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,61299,0.03856557447317314
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,9911141,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,37429,-0.042983378898004736
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,9994009,K99MH120343,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Behavior', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Viral', 'cell assembly', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'goal oriented behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2020,129087,0.027416357876979713
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,9955382,R01NS104892,"['Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'squid axon', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,386750,0.062100228464116156
"The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning As animals move about in the environment, they must be able to rapidly assess and update the meaning of cues around them in order to approach reward and avoid danger. Reversal learning, a paradigm commonly used to test behavioral flexibility, involves switching the association between a stimulus and its outcome. For example, a tone that initially predicted a sweet tastant can come to predict a bitter tastant. Two brain regions, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), are involved in tasks that demand flexible responses to the changing significance of stimuli during reversal learning. While several studies have provided evidence that the OFC and BLA interact during reversal learning, little is known about the specific mechanisms of this interaction. In this grant, we propose to use a combination of genetic and cellular imaging techniques in mice to identify and characterize the physiological response properties during reversal learning of BLA neurons that project to OFC. The reversal learning task we employ involves stimuli of multiple modalities that predict outcomes of both positive and negative value to thoroughly elucidate the differential response properties of BLA neurons to stimuli that change their associated reinforcement outcome (Aim 1). In these experiments, the physiological response properties of neurons identified as projecting from BLA to OFC will be compared to the response properties of the overall population. Then, using an optogenetic approach, we will test the causal role of OFC input onto BLA neurons during reversal learning by inhibiting the specific projections from OFC to BLA to test their causal role on behavioral flexibility and on the nature of representations in BLA (Aim 2). The data analysis for both aims involves collaboration with theoretical neuroscientists to use linear classifiers and other sophisticated techniques to understand the nature and dynamics of neural encoding in BLA and its relation to behavior. These experiments promise to shed light on the mechanisms by which cortico-amygdalar circuits mediate flexibility critical for adaptive emotional responses and behavior, an ability that is impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders. This grant investigates the dynamic interactions between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during a reversal learning task involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. The study promises to elucidate mechanisms fundamental to the flexible updating of emotional behavior, mechanisms that likely become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders.",The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning,9842566,R21MH116348,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quinine', 'Research', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Update', 'Virus', 'anatomic imaging', 'behavior test', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'emotional behavior', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fluorophore', 'genetic approach', 'insight', 'lens', 'neurotoxic', 'optogenetics', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virus genetics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,202500,0.04626170500167709
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9983219,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1025216,0.023344122464281056
"Systems-level and in situ transcriptomics deconstruction of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor transformation in an innate behavior Project Summary/Abstract In order to control specific behavioral responses, transcriptionally distinct cell types assembled into dynamic brain circuits integrate environmental information with internal states and generate purposeful motor actions. While tools have been developed to independently measure the activity dynamics, connectivity and transcriptional profiles of individual neurons, it remains challenging to integrate this diverse information into a coherent model of behavior. To address this challenge, we aim to uncover the sensorimotor transformations leading to a complex naturalistic behavior, male and female parenting, by developing innovative molecular, imaging and systems-level approaches and by integrating multimodal information obtained from single neurons in behaving animals. In aim 1, we will develop new tools to uncover the activity and the transcriptional identity of neuronal cell types involved in infant-mediated behavior. In aim 2, we will explore in molecular, functional, and behavioral terms how olfactory and other sensory modalities underlie parenting behavior in males and females and in virgin versus mated states. In aim 3, we will investigate how specific hypothalamic cell types process information reflecting behavioral outcomes using a combination of spatial transcriptomic, functional imaging, circuit tracing and behavioral methods. In aim 4, we will combine cell-type based neuronal architecture with activity patterns across key brain regions to formulate predictive models underlying the neural control of parenting. Project Narrative We propose to develop a transformative multimodal experimental platform to uncover the brain-wide architecture of neuronal circuits underlying parenting behavior in molecular, functional, connectivity-based and computational terms. We will use this experimental framework to shed light into the sensory motor transformation underlying parenting behavior as a function of the animal sex and physiological state.",Systems-level and in situ transcriptomics deconstruction of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor transformation in an innate behavior,9971196,R01NS116593,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Child Rearing', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Discipline', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instinct', 'Investigation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preoptic Areas', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'male', 'microendoscopy', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuroregulation', 'olfactory bulb glomeruli', 'predictive modeling', 'pup', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptomics']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2444289,0.07227842737562638
"Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models ABSTRACT  Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer's disease), afflicting tens of millions worldwide. The characteristic disease symptoms arise from basal ganglia dysfunction that occurs secondary to loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Symptomatic treatment is focused either on replacing dopamine or disrupting aberrant activity through deep- brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus or the primary basal ganglia output nucleus in the primate, internal globus pallidus (GPi). This proposal is aimed at understanding the function and dysfunction of basal ganglia circuitry in mice, at the output of the basal ganglia to motor thalamus. In Aim 1, we will develop strategies to identify basal ganglia-recipient motor thalamus neurons in ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamus (VA/VL), and characterize their projection targets and cortical inputs in awake, behaving animals. In Aim 2, we will use sophisticated in vivo strategies to record from posterior EP neurons and VA/VL neurons as animals move their limbs during locomotion, a fixed repetitive behavior. We will perturb activity in this pathway using optogenetics to determine the contribution of activity in these neurons to forelimb movements, and we will examine how activity in this pathway is altered after loss of striatal dopamine. In Aim 3, we will perform similar experiments in mice performing a lever-pulling task, a flexible forelimb movement. We will examine both cued and uncued versions of this task to distinguish activity generated internally vs. externally. Finally, we will examine how loss of striatal dopamine impacts EP and VA/VL activity during flexible forelimb movements. Our overarching goal is to understand how loss of striatal dopamine in PD leads to disruptions in basal ganglia circuit function and motor deficits, in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating PD motor symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) results from a progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, most of which innervate the basal ganglia. Here, we propose to study the effects of dopamine loss in mice, focusing on the function of the entopeduncular nucleus (a rodent equivalent of the internal globus pallidus, major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and a site of deep brain stimulation in PD) and the ventral motor thalamus. Remarkably, the function of these regions remains mysterious, yet they hold great promise for understanding PD and developing new therapeutic strategies for treating PD symptoms.",Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models,9971314,R01NS064984,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Axon', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dopamine', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Eye Movements', 'Forelimb', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homologous Gene', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Subthalamic structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'awake', 'base', 'body position', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'density', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'endopeduncular nucleus', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pars compacta', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NINDS,J.

"Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics A cell is a highly complex system with distributed molecular physiologies in structured sub- cellular compartments whose interplay with the nuclear genome determine the functional characteristics of the cell. A classic example of distributed genomic processes is found in neurons. Learning and memory requires modulation of individual synapses through RNA localization, localized translation, and localized metabolites such as those from dendritic mitochondria. Dendrites of neurons integrate distributed synaptic signals into both electrical and nuclear transcriptional response. Dysfunction of these distributed genomic functions in neurons can result in a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases such as bipolar and depressive disorders, autism, among others. Understanding complex genomic interactions within a single cell requires new technologies: we need nano-scale ability to make genome-wide measurements at highly localized compartments and to effect highly localized functional genomic manipulations, especially in live tissues. To address this need, we propose to establish a Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics using neurons as model systems. The center will develop new optical and nanotechnology approaches to isolate sub-cellular scale components for genomic, metabolomics, and lipidomic analyses. The center will also develop new mass spectrometry methods, molecular biology methods, and informatics models to create a platform technology for sub-cellular genomics. Many human diseases, especially neuropsychiatric diseases, can be traced to dysfunction of organelles and other sub-cellular components.
