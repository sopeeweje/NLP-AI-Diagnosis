"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9838368,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,687155,0.12088371494291192
"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,9664901,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2019,161047,0.02647835218700448
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy. This project develops a novel and practical analytic tool to identify patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease.",Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes,9741187,K01LM012924,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Congestive', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic cardiomyopathy', 'diabetic patient', 'effective intervention', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiologic data', 'heart disease risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research to practice', 'risk prediction model', 'secondary analysis']",NLM,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,185004,0.06784957321712996
"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient. In this project, computational methods and machine learning are proposed to harmonize large amounts of data, including clinical factors, imaging studies and cardiac signals, to provide tools to devise an individualized AF management strategy.",Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation,9821943,K23HL145017,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biometry', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Flecainide', 'Freedom', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life Style Modification', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nonpharmacologic Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Work', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'dofetilide', 'economic implication', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'functional outcomes', 'heart rhythm', 'imaging study', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,193536,0.03667222780135927
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9769734,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2019,228000,0.04275139699990868
"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities. The exploration of additional markers of recovery can continue to provide quantification of heart failure conditions useful for clinicians and patients alike.",Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning,9809933,R21EB028486,"['Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'EFRAC', 'Education', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Gender', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'analytical method', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'heart function', 'heart rate monitor', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rate of change', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2019,208632,0.05883173165624227
"Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), characterized by heart failure symptoms with normal ejection fraction, is highly prevalent. However, most HFpEF patients do not respond to standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and there are no clear and uniform diagnostic criteria to stratify and differentiate HFpEF from HFrEF. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need for us to better understand HFpEF at the molecular and system levels. Unbiased approaches such as machine learning (ML) offer a powerful means to tease out the molecular signatures of HFpEF in relevant disease models. The emerging evidence implicates that metabolism and redox homeostasis are two significant disruptions in cellular processes evidenced by clinical symptoms of HFpEF. Previous studies have identified branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic defect as another major metabolic hallmark in heart failure as well as in metabolic disorders. Moreover, BCAA catabolic defects have been demonstrated to directly impact mitochondrial function and elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in oxidative stress-sensitive post-translational modifications (O-PTMs) that govern protein function and pathways. These exciting discoveries lead to our new hypothesis that O-PTM-mediated proteome remodeling is a dynamic and pervasive molecular change in diseased hearts, affecting proteins with central function in cardiac homeostasis and pathophysiology. To investigate the unique molecular features and pathogenic mechanisms of HFpEF, we highlight a novel HFpEF mouse model that incorporates both genetic predisposition for obesity/diabetes and pressure-overload, the two major risk factors for HFpEF, by performing trans-aortic constriction (TAC) in the ob/ob mice. We have also perfected the experimental tools and data analysis platform to provide O-PTM profiling at the whole-proteome level in hearts. Accordingly, we have strategically formulated the following aims according to three phenotypic levels: At the systemic level, Aim 1 will establish and characterize in vivo mouse models of HFpEF vs. HFrEF by cardiac and mitochondrial function as well as redox status. At the organellar level, Aim 2 will conduct targeted proteomics profiling of the cardiac mitochondria and extract O-PTM signatures using ML-based methods to achieve deep phenotyping of HFpEF and HFrEF. This information will then be integrated and enriched in an O- PTM molecular atlas and knowledge graph. At the molecular level, Aim 3 will target the BCAA catabolic pathway to exhaustively scrutinize its role in HFpEF and HFrEF. A multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE HFpEF is highly prevalent, yet there are few effective treatments or clear criteria to differentiate it from HFrEF. We propose to extract molecular signatures unique to HFpEF and HFrEF using a novel HFpEF mouse model and machine learning-based approaches. We anticipate that a multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway,9716114,R01HL146739,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biology', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Cardiac', 'Catabolism', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Defect', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'EFRAC', 'Enzymes', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glucose', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Homeostasis', 'Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Myocardium', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinness', 'Treatment Failure', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'base', 'computational platform', 'constriction', 'effective therapy', 'empowered', 'exhaustion', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'heart function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'men', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'protein function', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,649707,0.05812639454641299
"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,9625645,K23HL135274,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Self Administration', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavior change', 'big biomedical data', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preempt', 'prevent', 'professor', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,203257,0.09267906526256978
"Mentoring in patient-oriented atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular research PROJECT SUMMARY This application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Alvaro Alonso, with protected time and other support to (1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior clinical investigators and graduate students engaged in patient-oriented cardiovascular research; (2) obtain additional training in omics, machine learning, and mentoring best-practices; and (3) advance Dr. Alonso's ongoing research on the risk factors and mechanisms contributing to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Mentoring activities will build upon the ongoing involvement of Dr. Alonso in several training programs at Emory University, including an NHLBI-funded multidisciplinary T32 training grant on cardiovascular health disparities, the research-track Cardiology fellowship program at the School of Medicine, and the Master of Public Health and PhD programs in epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health. Training will focus on cutting-edge methodological areas in rapid development, including integration of omic technologies and machine learning in patient-oriented research, as well as acquisition of skills in academic, research, and clinical mentoring. Finally, this award will support a research project that extends Dr. Alonso's ongoing work on understanding the factors influencing the development of the AF substrate, understanding AF pathophysiology, and preventing AF-related outcomes. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to identify novel AF phenotypes (phenogroups) using extensive clinical and multi-omic data (“phenomapping”), (2) to discover specific risk factors for the different AF phenogroups, and (3) to determine associations of AF phenogroups with selected endpoints (stroke, heart failure, mortality). These research aims will be carried out in the context of the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, an ongoing prospective registry of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in three Emory-affiliated hospitals currently including approximately 7,000 unique individuals with detailed phenotyping, clinical outcomes, and multi-omic markers. In summary, the activities proposed in this application will favorably impact Dr. Alonso's capabilities to conduct cutting-edge and innovative patient-oriented research on cardiovascular prevention and his ability to perform as a highly qualified mentor for junior clinicians pursuing research on clinical cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite progress, atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia, remains a major public health program. This award will contribute to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of atrial fibrillation.

"Real-Time Virtual Assessment of MitraClip Placement ABSTRACT Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common type of valvular heart disease in patients over the age of 75 years in the US. Despite the prevalence of MR in the elderly population, however, almost half of patients identified with moderate- severe MR are turned down for traditional open-heart surgery due to co-morbidities. MitraClip (MC) is a recent percutaneous approach to treat MR by placement of MC in the center of the mitral valve (MV) to reduce MR. Despite the positive short-term outcomes of the MC procedure in reducing MR, the long-term outcome can be further improved if the effects of MC on both the fluid and solid mechanics of the MV and left ventricle (LV) were available at the time the clip is placed. Recently, we developed a physics-based human cardiac function simulator for the optimal design of a novel annuloplasty ring with a sub-MV element for correction of MR, as well as physics-based simulations of MC placement. The problem with these simulations, as far as clinical applications is concerned, is they are extremely time consuming (3 days to complete simulations on 96-processor cluster). One way to make these time consuming simulations clinically applicable is to run them in advance for a wide range of patient characteristics (e.g., degree of MR, size and shape of the MV and LV, etc.) and MC placements. Currently, when clinicians are ready to place the MC on the MV, they have at their fingertips real-time data on degree of MR, and size and shape of the MV and LV measured using 3D transesophageal echocardiography (RT3D-TEE). We propose the development and validation of a searchable virtual patient atlas (SVPA) that will provide the clinician with detailed predictions of patient outcomes in real time that are based on MC placement and the RT3D-TEE patient-specific data. The first 50 models in our SVPA will be created from existing RT3D-TEE datasets provided by National Heart Centre Singapore, NHCS. Then, we will use our novel-shape dictionary learning models to automatically generate 150 additional models for our SVPA. Machine learning models will be trained with the simulation data in order to create machine learning-FE (ML-FE) surrogates that can predict FE outputs directly from the model geometry. This would enable real-time prediction of patient-specific MC device outcomes. Our preliminary studies using 3D heart simulations clearly show that the main advantage with the ML model over the 3D FE model is speed (i.e., ML runs in 1 CPU second versus 3D FE model runs in 1100 CPU hours!). We will validate the outcome predictions of our SVPA using an additional 50 existing RT3D-TEE datasets with known MC patient outcomes provided by NHCS. After the outcome prediction using SVPA for each case, we will use the dataset and the measured outcome to train the original SVPA further and validate a new dataset with the original and the updated SVPA. We will select the more accurate SVPA (the original or the updated) to determine possible correlations between the primary geometrical parameters and other patient overall biometric information with the MR and optimal MC placement. NARRATIVE A leaky inlet valve of the major pumping chamber of the heart is the most common valvular heart disease in elderly patients. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a device that can be inserted into the patient’s heart using a catheter.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9688580,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral fat', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,653101,0.13615611802074837
"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations. In this study, we will evaluate the epidemiology and outcomes of advanced HF in a geographically-defined population, develop computer algorithms that can accurately and efficiently identify advanced HF, and assess the burdens and experiences of patients living with advanced HF to enable the design of new interventions to improve care and quality of life.",Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes,9815239,R01HL144529,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Mixes', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Refractory Disease', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Ventricular Function', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rural setting']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,598123,0.07527842267669745
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9988737,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,544562,0.025114718403561487
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9650623,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,535600,0.04685929437478486
"Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that represents the end stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) subsequent to progressing myocardial damage or ischemia. In populations at ages 65 and older, coronary artery disease (CAD) serves as the leading cause of HF. Although low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a major evidence for the diagnosis of HF in clinical practice, impaired regional myocardial dysfunction is expected to present the existence of CAD in its early stage.  Heart deformation analysis (HDA) is a cutting-edge myocardial motion analysis technique that is able to automatically track the myocardium borders on time frames and calculate global and regional cardiac functional and motional indices on existing cine images without extra scans. In the present study, we will use the HDA tool to analyze existing cine images of CHARISMA study. From 2009 to 2012, cardiac MRI exams (including coronary wall imaging and cine MRI at two-chamber, four-chamber and short-axis views) and concurrent tests for traditional cardiovascular risk factors were performed on 440 older participants (age: 65 - 84 years old at the time of MRI scans) without documented history of CVDs. During the present R03 project (2019-2021), CHARISMA participants would have been followed-up for 10 - 12 years. We plan to relate newly- acquired regional myocardial motion indices (displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate) to clinical outcomes, existing coronary wall measures and results of lab tests in CHARISMA datasets. We will test the overall hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to present cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic elderly. Three specific aims are: 1) Predict cardiovascular events using baseline regional myocardial motion indices; 2) Relate regional myocardial motion indices to MRI-derived features of coronary remodeling; and 3) Determine correlations between regional myocardial motion indices and traditional cardiovascular risk biomarkers/conditions collected in CHARISMA study.  No new MRI scans or lab tests are required in this project. Through a cost-effective approach, the immediate objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical value of regional myocardial motion for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic older adults, a major target population of cardiovascular prevention. This study will also help us better understand the correlations between impaired myocardial function/motion and subclinical CAD burden. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the selection of quantitative imaging biomarkers and their optimal cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular events in future clinical studies. Project Narrative  In the present study, we will use heart deformation analysis (HDA) to reanalyze existing cardiac MRI data of CHARISMA study.

"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,9800334,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,802772,0.04271501162840644
"HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model HLS17-12. The US FDA is considering to establish a new cardiac safety assessment approach  defined by a new paradigm called, “Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CIPA)”. The CIPA will 1) assess drug effects on each cardiac ion channel type individually using a high- throughput assay ion channel assays, 2) compute net effect on repolarization and risks for  torsade pointes (TdP) using a mathematical model, and 3) confirm the computational prediction by measuring the drug’s effects on action potentials in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human cardiac myocytes (CMs). This paradigm shift, if successful, could reduce the cost of  cardiac safety analyses by replacing or lowering the requirement to perform an expensive ($2-4 million) thorough QT study during clinical trials. Protecting consumers from drug induced  arrhythmia and sudden deaths is a paramount importance for the regulators and pharmaceutical companies as well as lowing the cost of drug development. Many cardiac safety scientists, however, are skeptical about CIPA’s approach since CMs derived from human iPSCs exhibit a poor excitation-contraction coupling due to their immaturity. In addition, a proposed CIPA mathematical model was developed to simulate electrophysiology of human adult CMs, so there is a mismatch between experimental system and computational tool. To address these concerns, we proposed three specific aims in tw0 phases by following Fast- Track SBIR processes. Phase I feasibility Aim 1 will measure drug-induced changes in AP and CaT using human adult heart slices isolated from human donors. Here we will confirm our  successful handling and analyzing human adult heart slices, which will be based on a recently  published protocol by our collaborator, Dr. Igor Efimov, at George Washington University. After this validation, we will move on to perform the following two studies: Aim 2. Compare drug-induced changes in AP and CaT in NuHearts generated from adult CMs and cardiac fibroblasts from same human donor hearts; Aim 3. Validate and improve the computational models and train an artificial intelligence to predict cardiac safety risks of unknow compounds. After our successful completion proposed projects, we can establish an unprecedented cardiac safety assessment platform that can predict safety issues using a well-trained AI without doing any experiments using human heart slices that are rarely accessible for most of the safety  laboratories or biotech firms. Because nearly one third of drug candidates fails to reach market due to its cardiac safety concerns, a better safety assessment approach without increasing its cost is needed to improve productivity of pharmaceutical industry. The proposed project combines computational and experimental analyses of cardiac safety parameters using adult heart cells isolated from a donor heart and its stem cell derived heart muscle cells to build a better but cost-effective cardiac safety assessment system. A successfully validated system enables drug developers to arcuately predict a new drug’s cardiac safety profile by only running cost-effective experiments using stem cell derived heart muscle cells that are accessible to many drug developers.",HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model,9764845,R44HL139248,"['3-Dimensional', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Expert Systems', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Pump', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shipping', 'Ships', 'Slice', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stem cells', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'heart preservation', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'mathematical model', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'response', 'safety assessment', 'screening', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'success']",NHLBI,"INVIVOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,881652,0.0620065762326111
"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,9625162,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,395000,0.019472171018960004
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9687744,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2019,143581,0.02131753724873255
"Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction to the exposure to severe psychological stress, including trauma re-experiencing, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. Our group has conducted seminal work to establish PTSD as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and autonomic dysfunction. A major concern, based on these findings, is that PTSD could increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) through autonomic dysregulation. This has important clinical implications on management of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. Two important metrics that are potentially useful for risk stratification are T-wave alternans (TWA) and Morphological Beat Variability (MVB). We have found in preliminary investigations that TWA may be linked to acute stress and PTSD, but additional study is needed. In this R03 application, we seek to collaborate with Dr. Gari Clifford in Biomedical Informatics to create a custom program that measures TWA and MVB with state-of- the-art signal processing in a recently recruited cohort of male veteran twins with high-resolution ECG data. We will also study for genetic influences with twin modeling and the effects of acute stress with laboratory- based trauma reminder challenges. Our aims are to 1) Examine the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA a) over 24 hours, and b) during trauma recall challenge; 2) Evaluate the potential role for familial and genetic factors by comparing the within-pair difference in MVB and TWA between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD. We hypothesize that MVB and TWA will be higher, on average, during a 24 hour period, and will increase during trauma recall challenge in PTSD subjects compared to those without PTSD. In addition, we hypothesize that the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA will be stronger within DZ pairs than MZ pairs, implying that there is a common genetic pathway linking PTSD and SCD risk. The development of methods to measure these factors, as well as the study of these important mechanisms, will accelerate Dr. Shah’s progress towards research independence, and help to establish him as an expert in the field of mental stress and SCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Posttraumatic stress disorder is a common and debilitating psychiatric condition that is associated with increased heart disease risk. Whether or not this means that it increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia is not known, but important for clinical management.

"Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Abnormalities in heart rate, cardiac conduction (PR and QRS) and repolarization (QT) measured on the ECG predispose to the clinically important cardiac arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) / sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examine the genomic basis of these ECG endophenotypes in order to deconstruct arrhythmias into more proximate traits and discrete components, allowing us to better understand underlying mechanisms, provide insight into arrhythmia generation, and help target development of novel therapies.  The molecular architecture of cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias is not fully understood, but likely involves genomic, epigenomic, and environmental influences. Over the past 10 years, we have identified numerous common loci associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias, yet these common variants account for only a portion of the heritability of electrophysiologic and arrhythmic phenotypes. The agnostic examination of genotype-phenotype associations employed in genome- wide association studies (GWAS) does not incorporate knowledge of functional genomic regions or important biologic relationships. Additionally, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms connecting mostly intergenic and intronic GWAS signals to phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that a systems biology approach integrating genetic sequence variation with omic data (epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) will uncover novel associations and elucidate biologic mechanisms associated with arrhythmia-related phenotypes. We further hypothesize that examining the simultaneous association between sequence variation and multiple cardiac electrophysiologic phenotypes will help uncover additional novel mechanisms associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias.  TOPMed's combination of rich phenotype data, with whole genome sequence (WGS), epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, provides a unique opportunity to more comprehensively explore these hypotheses. We leverage sequence, omic, and phenotype data from multiple cohort studies to efficiently and cost-effectively examine and dissect association of omic factors with cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia risk. Our application is an ambitious yet eminently feasible effort that integrates clinical, genetic, and systems biology expertise. We aim to discover associations using omics data (Aims 1 and 2) and elucidate specific genes and biologic pathways underlying these associations (Aims 3 and 4). Our ultimate goal is to identify pathways, genes, and genetic variation that are clinically relevant, and therefore potentially the target of new therapies, diagnostics, or risk predictions. Narrative Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This proposal aims to use genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, combined with complex systems biology and pleiotropic analyses, to better understand the underlying pathways and genes involved in normal electrophysiology and arrhythmia formation. The identification of biologic factors that influence cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias will provide insight into the mechanisms of arrhythmia generation, and perhaps identify better targets for drug development and prevention.",Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias.,9737693,R01HL141989,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'heart electrical activity', 'insight', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'rare variant', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,490901,0.0450428778790332
"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system.

"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction. The proposed study would be the first large study with gold-standard phenotyping of the heart and lungs and would test highly specific hypothesized based upon recent advances in lung subphenotyping to yield personalized approaches to combined cardiopulmonary disease in COPD.",Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF,9819260,R01HL093081,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DRD1 gene', 'Death Rate', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'FGF10 gene', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoxia', 'Impairment', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'RARA gene', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'heart function', 'heart preservation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'unsupervised learning', 'vasoconstriction']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,2391491,0.0585288784787628
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants. In addition, it will allow to expand a patient orientated research program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research in cardiovascular imaging and that provides an ideal environment to develop future leaders in clinical research.",Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease,9732611,K24HL113128,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Charge', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peer Review Grants', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'effectiveness trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'sex', 'skills', 'synergism', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K24,2019,120852,0.06225851748720882
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9692475,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2019,394737,0.04561596408370336
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,9682500,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Blood Pressure', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2019,172137,0.07214876030466434
"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in stem-cell technology enable patient-derived cells to be turned into functional heart cells, and this is an exciting direction towards personalized medicine; yet, there are many challenges in optimizing these cardiomyocytes to better mimic the real heart – a problem that the proposed engineering tools will help resolve.",Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation,9687111,R01HL144157,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Data', 'Disease model', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'NADH', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'heart cell', 'heart metabolism', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanocarrier', 'optogenetics', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'stem cell technology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'voltage']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,728876,0.06549869925888759
"A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement Abstract In the United States alone, more than three million peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are placed each year to provide IV therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Improper PICC placement is relatively common, is costly, and has serious complications for critically-ill patients. Unfortunately, under blind placement 30-55% of PICC tips are not optimally placed on the first attempt and require repositioning, which has an average direct cost of $223 per patient and often necessitates the removal and reinsertion of the catheter line that carries a 4-6% risk of pneumothorax. Moreover, approximately 17% of these improperly positioned PICCs are placed into the right atrium, which is associated with a multitude of life-threatening complications. Improper placement of PICCs also often requires referral to an interventional radiologist for fluoroscopic-guided central line placement, which is expensive ($1,000) and requires more radiation exposure for the patient. Not surprisingly, over half of all PICCs are administered to patients over the age of 60. Therefore, safe and accurate PICC placement is critical for providing high-quality care to older Americans. Despite serious adverse events associated with blind placement of PICC lines, current vascular access systems have not been widely adopted. The Teleflex ARROW® G4 VPS and the Bard Sherlock 3CG® TCS are PICC guidance systems that employ ECG for positioning the PICC tip into the correct location: the region that includes the lower superior vena cava (SVC) and cavoatrial junction (CAJ). While these procedures often limit the need for a confirmatory X-ray, they have poor and variable successful placement rates (44-84%), are 30-70% more expensive than standard PICCs, require skilled staff, and have significantly longer procedure times as compared to standard, blind PICC placement. Additionally, these guidance systems rely on the use of ECG, which is ineffective for patients with cardiac arrhythmias, a condition that affects approximately 16% of all patients requiring a PICC line. To address the need for accurate, safe, and cost- effective PICC placement, Piccolo Medical has developed the Smart PICC™ system, a point-of-care catheter system that uses unique hemodynamic signatures of different vascular regions for real-time vascular access guidance into the SVC/CAJ. The goals of this Phase II proposal are to validate the accuracy of the Piccolo Smart PICC™ for navigation and placement of a PICC tip into the SVC or CAJ for adult patients with and without cardiac arrhythmias. First, we will verify the sensitivity of the Smart PICC™ system algorithm to identify correct PICC placement in adult patients with both normal and altered cardiac rhythms (Aim 1). Second, we will compare the accuracy of the Smart PICC™ system to the most widely used catheter navigation system (BD’s Sherlock 3CG® TCS) in a head-to-head superiority study (Aim 2).The data obtained will support FDA 510(k) clearance and will allow us to commercialize the system within ~2.5 years of the funding of this proposal. Narrative Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used to provide life-sustaining intravenous therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Commercially available PICC navigation systems can be effective, but have limitations that have impeded adoption into the clinic. We propose an inexpensive, easily operated catheter system for real-time vascular access guidance that addresses the limitations of current systems.","A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement",9919215,R44AG060793,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Arrhythmia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Distal', 'EKG P Wave', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Valves', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardial', 'Navigation System', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiation exposure', 'Randomized', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Right atrial structure', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Savings', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superior vena cava structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thermodilution', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Venous system', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'radiologist', 'sensor']",NIA,"PICCOLO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2019,915143,0.01786597812336713
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9614825,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,826025,0.12088371494291192
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy.

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9584176,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2018,190000,0.04275139699990868
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9475862,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2018,589455,0.10914854939816439
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record.

"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack.

"Real-time Monitoring of Zebrafish ECG with Automated Aberrant Pattern Detection Abstract Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH STTR grant with University of Washington (UW) is to provide a flexible system to assess cardiac electrical activities in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Unlike humans, zebrafish hearts can fully regenerate following cardiac injury, thereby providing a tractable model system to study endogenous heart regeneration. Zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal vertebrate model system for phenotype-based screening owing to their physiological similarity to mammals. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves sedation causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. In this context, we propose and develop 1) a wireless flexible “jacket” to be worn by zebrafish for real-time assessment of electrical cardiac phenotypes, namely ECG; and 2) a simple-yet-novel apparatus to collect ECG of multiple awake fish. Our devices provide pivotal platforms for cardiac phenotype-related investigations. The obtained data will be processed by smart algorithms to detect aberrant ECG patterns in real time. The proposed systems will facilitate related studies using zebrafish models. Further, the success of this platform also paves the avenue for regenerative medicine and developmental biology studies as well as stem cell-based therapies for cardiac repair. In Phase I of this STTR grant, we will develop i) a polymer-based microelectrode array (MEA) jacket that could be comfortably worn by the zebrafish and provide wireless ECG acquisition; and ii) a 4-chamber apparatus for simultaneous recording of ECG in awake fish. Machine learning-based programs with embedded algorithms will be developed to distinguish ECG patterns such as heart rate, ST and QT intervals, thus can identify anomalies, such as arrhythmias or prolonged QTs. For proof of concept, the system will be validated and compared. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase I STTR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of Washington will develop 1) a world-first wireless flexible membrane for zebrafish with a micro-electrode array (MEA) for ECG measurement and electronics for wireless powering and communication with an external unit; 2) a simple-yet-novel 4-chamber apparatus to acquire ECG of 4 awake fish; and 3) Machine learning-based programs to process the data and detect desired patterns. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based screening in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous studies.

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9534732,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,550853,0.025114718403561487
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9418100,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,551823,0.04685929437478486
"CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Training data capitalizing upon the NIH-funded Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as well as recently published guidance documents by the American Heart Association (AHA) and International Society of Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT.) This project will involve a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: bioengineering, advanced heart failure cardiology, cardiac surgery, computer science (machine learning/data mining), medical ethics, and palliative care. Carnegie Mellon University, one of the Nation's leading institutions for Computer Science will coordinate this project to assure a productive collaboration with four clinical sites: Allegheny Health Network (Pittsburgh), U. Colorado Denver, Duke University, and Harvard/Brigham & Women's hospital. By achieve consensus amongst stakeholders, we hope to assure the acceptance of CORA into practice and ultimately improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of the treatment of end-stage heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a debilitating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. Treatment can be very complicated, and for some, may involve advanced technologies like heart-assist devices and stents, and for others palliative care.

"Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that represents the end stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) subsequent to progressing myocardial damage or ischemia. In populations at ages 65 and older, coronary artery disease (CAD) serves as the leading cause of HF. Although low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a major evidence for the diagnosis of HF in clinical practice, impaired regional myocardial dysfunction is expected to present the existence of CAD in its early stage.  Heart deformation analysis (HDA) is a cutting-edge myocardial motion analysis technique that is able to automatically track the myocardium borders on time frames and calculate global and regional cardiac functional and motional indices on existing cine images without extra scans. In the present study, we will use the HDA tool to analyze existing cine images of CHARISMA study. From 2009 to 2012, cardiac MRI exams (including coronary wall imaging and cine MRI at two-chamber, four-chamber and short-axis views) and concurrent tests for traditional cardiovascular risk factors were performed on 440 older participants (age: 65 - 84 years old at the time of MRI scans) without documented history of CVDs. During the present R03 project (2019-2021), CHARISMA participants would have been followed-up for 10 - 12 years. We plan to relate newly- acquired regional myocardial motion indices (displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate) to clinical outcomes, existing coronary wall measures and results of lab tests in CHARISMA datasets. We will test the overall hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to present cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic elderly. Three specific aims are: 1) Predict cardiovascular events using baseline regional myocardial motion indices; 2) Relate regional myocardial motion indices to MRI-derived features of coronary remodeling; and 3) Determine correlations between regional myocardial motion indices and traditional cardiovascular risk biomarkers/conditions collected in CHARISMA study.  No new MRI scans or lab tests are required in this project. Through a cost-effective approach, the immediate objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical value of regional myocardial motion for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic older adults, a major target population of cardiovascular prevention. This study will also help us better understand the correlations between impaired myocardial function/motion and subclinical CAD burden. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the selection of quantitative imaging biomarkers and their optimal cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular events in future clinical studies. Project Narrative  In the present study, we will use heart deformation analysis (HDA) to reanalyze existing cardiac MRI data of CHARISMA study. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to predict cardiovascular risk in older adults.",Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults,9647817,R03HL144891,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chicago', 'Cine Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gelatinase B', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radial', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Smoking', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventricular', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'follow-up', 'healthy aging', 'heart damage', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'myocardial damage', 'quantitative imaging', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2018,79000,-0.020019086284765415
"HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model HLS17-12. The US FDA is considering to establish a new cardiac safety assessment approach de- fined by a new paradigm called, “Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CIPA)”. The CIPA will 1) assess drug effects on each cardiac ion channel type individually using a high- throughput assay ion channel assays, 2) compute net effect on repolarization and risks for tor- sade pointes (TdP) using a mathematical model, and 3) confirm the computational prediction by measuring the drug’s effects on action potentials in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human cardiac myocytes (CMs). This paradigm shift, if successful, could reduce the cost of car- diac safety analyses by replacing or lowering the requirement to perform an expensive ($2-4 million) thorough QT study during clinical trials. Protecting consumers from drug induced ar- rhythmia and sudden deaths is a paramount importance for the regulators and pharmaceutical companies as well as lowing the cost of drug development. Many cardiac safety scientists, however, are skeptical about CIPA’s approach since CMs derived from human iPSCs exhibit a poor excitation-contraction coupling due to their immaturity. In addition, a proposed CIPA mathematical model was developed to simulate electrophysiology of human adult CMs, so there is a mismatch between experimental system and computational tool. To address these concerns, we proposed three specific aims in tw0 phases by following Fast- Track SBIR processes. Phase I feasibility Aim 1 will measure drug-induced changes in AP and CaT using human adult heart slices isolated from human donors. Here we will confirm our suc- cessful handling and analyzing human adult heart slices, which will be based on a recently pub- lished protocol by our collaborator, Dr. Igor Efimov, at George Washington University. After this validation, we will move on to perform the following two studies: Aim 2. Compare drug-induced changes in AP and CaT in NuHearts generated from adult CMs and cardiac fibroblasts from same human donor hearts; Aim 3. Validate and improve the computational models and train an artificial intelligence to predict cardiac safety risks of unknow compounds. After our successful completion proposed projects, we can establish an unprecedented cardiac safety assessment platform that can predict safety issues using a well-trained AI without doing any experiments using human heart slices that are rarely accessible for most of the safety labor- atories or biotech firms. Because nearly one third of drug candidates fails to reach market due to its cardiac safety concerns, a better safety assessment approach without increasing its cost is needed to improve productivity of pharmaceutical industry. The proposed project combines computational and experimental analyses of cardiac safety parameters using adult heart cells isolated from a donor heart and its stem cell derived heart muscle cells to build a better but cost-effective cardiac safety assessment system. A successfully validated system enables drug developers to arcuately predict a new drug’s cardiac safety profile by only running cost-effective experiments using stem cell derived heart muscle cells that are accessible to many drug developers.",HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model,9555779,R44HL139248,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Pump', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shipping', 'Ships', 'Slice', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stem cells', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'man', 'mathematical model', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success']",NHLBI,"INVIVOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2018,349385,0.05646306396262
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9502161,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2018,143581,0.02131753724873255
"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system.

"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants. In addition, it will allow to expand a patient orientated research program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research in cardiovascular imaging and that provides an ideal environment to develop future leaders in clinical research.",Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease,9475268,K24HL113128,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Charge', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peer Review Grants', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'effectiveness trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'sex', 'skills', 'synergism', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K24,2018,120852,0.06225851748720882
"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,9427555,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,395000,0.019472171018960004
"System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Summary BioInVision, Inc. and Case Western Reserve University researchers will develop software for quantitative anal- ysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP), creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with coronary anatomy from computed tomography angi- ography (CTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CTA+CCTP combo could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, if flow is low and no stenosis is present, it will suggest microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and in diabetes. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, not available in any other single modality. It has excellent resolution ena- bling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway now dominated by SPECT myocardial imaging, which includes zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable estimates of flow. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trust- worthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging. With suc- cess, our project could lead to an improved gateway examination that could reduce unnecessary invasive cor- onary angiography, thereby reducing costs, patient discomfort, patient risk, and possibly unnecessary interven- tional therapies.",System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion,9622204,R41HL144271,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary artery', 'Cost Savings', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Iodine', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'blood flow measurement', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'perfusion imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,"BIOINVISION, INC.",R41,2018,224240,-0.04700295553524153
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9505972,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular Abnormalities', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,1319272,0.09219791086780918
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9417961,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'heart function', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'procedure cost', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,658634,0.08836271528162085
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9519828,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2018,392266,0.04561596408370336
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,9504767,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Blood Pressure', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2018,172141,0.07214876030466434
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9281894,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2017,593963,0.10914854939816439
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9310380,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,653101,0.13615611802074837
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9282634,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collimator', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical imaging', 'computer generated', 'cost', 'detector', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'solid state', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,600120,0.055347137452434816
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9363302,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional', 'vascular sonography']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,518262,0.025114718403561487
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9283910,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,544529,0.04685929437478486
"CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Training data capitalizing upon the NIH-funded Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as well as recently published guidance documents by the American Heart Association (AHA) and International Society of Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT.) This project will involve a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: bioengineering, advanced heart failure cardiology, cardiac surgery, computer science (machine learning/data mining), medical ethics, and palliative care. Carnegie Mellon University, one of the Nation's leading institutions for Computer Science will coordinate this project to assure a productive collaboration with four clinical sites: Allegheny Health Network (Pittsburgh), U. Colorado Denver, Duke University, and Harvard/Brigham & Women's hospital. By achieve consensus amongst stakeholders, we hope to assure the acceptance of CORA into practice and ultimately improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of the treatment of end-stage heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a debilitating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions.

"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9324206,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2017,156686,0.06463335086927145
"CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring ReThink Medical, Inc. proposes to develop an ambulatory version of the physiologic monitoring technology it validated in Phase I, the CorBand. The CorBand is designed to track key physiologic parameters that are predictive of cardiac decompensation, to detect the early stages of decompensation, and to relay both the physiologic data and generated alerts to relevant caregivers with the end goal of reducing hospitalizations by enabling proactive/preventative care in the heart failure population. Heart failure effects 5.8 million individuals in the US and the costs associated are approaching $40 billion annually. This technology will not only improve the quality of life for heart failure patients, but also help to reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that puts emphasis on preventative care through health monitoring technologies. Our specific aims include (1) manufacturing a robust version of the device for use in two large, long term, ambulatory studies. It will be validated using patients who have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity levels, and fluid index derived from the CorBand will be compared with data collected from CIEDs manufactured by Medtronic and Boston Scientific and analyzed for correlation. (2) The CorBand will be deployed in a large ambulatory population of HF patients. We will collect the patient's clinical notes and note hospitalization events along with remote physiologic data from the CorBand. We will use this data to further build a predictive model for cardiac decompensation using a number of machine learning approaches. In aim (3), we will perform a controlled study on a population of HF patients. All the subjects will wear the CorBand; we will use the data from half the subjects to predict decompensation events, provide that information to subject's caregiver in order to provide preventative care. The other half will receive usual care. We will then examine the number of HF related hospitalizations in both groups to evaluate the ability of the CorBand to reduce hospitalizations. Our goal is to simplify the management of heart failure while improving the quality of care of the patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel, non-invasive multi-parameter sensor with telemetry for monitoring patients with heart failure combined with an algorithm for detecting early-stage cardiac decompensation with a goal of preventing hospitalizations.",CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring,9335418,R44HL125001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Boston', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cloud Service', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Edema', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'clinical decision-making', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'health care service', 'heart rate variability', 'hemodynamics', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'indexing', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment group']",NHLBI,"RETHINK MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2017,490059,0.11398753333732536
"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9267094,R21AG051077,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Bioenergetics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardium', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'exercise intolerance', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation management', 'respiratory', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,229328,-0.020301413426358658
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants. In addition, it will allow to expand a patient orientated research program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research in cardiovascular imaging and that provides an ideal environment to develop future leaders in clinical research.",Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease,9314834,K24HL113128,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Charge', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peer Review Grants', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'effectiveness trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'sex', 'skills', 'synergism', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K24,2017,121969,0.06225851748720882
"Air Pollution, Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in MESA Abstract Kaufman: Air pollution, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation burden in MESA This proposal examines the impact of ambient air pollutants on the development, burden, and triggering of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Air pollutants, especially particulate matter, have been associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease, especially coronary heart disease and stroke. The incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke is declining due to prevention efforts, while development of heart failure (HF, especially with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and atrial arrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation, AF) are becoming more important components of the burden of cardiovascular disease; the role of environmental factors in these two frequently co-existing conditions diseases is largely unstudied. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is an extraordinarily valuable cohort for understanding predictors and correlates of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, due to participants’ ages, extensive existing phenotyping, and planned assessment in an examination beginning in 2016. In addition, MESA has become the most carefully studied cohort in terms of exposure to ambient air pollutants. This proposed study will extend the air pollutant characterization using innovative low-cost indoor and outdoor home-based monitoring and state-of-the-art modeling approaches incorporating extensive geographic inputs. We will characterize both the relationship between long-term ambient exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), oxides of nitrogen (NOX), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO), and development of early stage heart failure and atrial arrhythmias, and the relationship between short-term exposure to air pollutants and triggering of atrial arrhythmias and AF burden. It is important to understand these relationships since: 1) Air pollutants are associated with cardiovascular mortality; 2) HF and structural disease correlates of HF are risk factors for AF; and 3) HFpEF with AF represents a group at especially high mortality risk. We will estimate long-term (annual average) and short-term (hourly and daily) concentrations of PM2.5, NOX, NO2, O3, and CO, outside and inside all MESA participants’ homes using state-of-the-art monitoring technology and spatiotemporal statistical models. We will use novel low-cost pollutant monitoring sensors at a subset of MESA participant homes and community locations. Early evidence of prevalent HF subtypes and newly emerging sub-phenotypes will be assessed using information from in-exam echocardiographic cardiac parameters, 6-minute walk test results, arterial tonometry, and biomarkers (NTproBNP, sST2, galectin-3). Ambulatory novel two-week ECG monitoring and interrogations of implanted pacemakers and cardioverter-defibrillators will allow us to assess the association between long-term air pollution exposure and AF and short-term air pollution and the triggering of atrial arrhythmias. Through this effort, we will gain unprecedented insight into the role of air pollutants in development of cardiovascular disease, with a focus on HF, especially HFpEF, and on AF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are increasingly important health problems as our population ages. Air pollution exposures have been linked to both HF and AF, but many questions remain about the relationships, and new technologies are available to study this. By understanding the relationship between short- and long-term air pollution exposures and the development of HF and triggering and burden of AF, we can gain critical information to help protect public health, reduce health inequality, and inform air quality regulatory policy.","Air Pollution, Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in MESA",9386363,R56ES026528,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Defibrillators', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exposure to', 'Galectin 3', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocarditis', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'Nitrogen Oxides', 'Obesity', 'Ozone', 'Pacemakers', 'Participant', 'Particulate Matter', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'aging population', 'ambient air pollution', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'cardiogenesis', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'disability', 'environmental agent', 'fine particles', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'innovation', 'insight', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pollutant', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R56,2017,600964,0.08506081155688022
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9313715,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular Abnormalities', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,1338683,0.09219791086780918
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9229057,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,680651,0.08836271528162085
"Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,9348609,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2017,158609,0.08485787310122608
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9365658,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2017,400000,0.04561596408370336
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,9018050,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Cesarean section', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'pressure', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2016,193120,0.04275609781865261
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9043186,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2016,599020,0.10914854939816439
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,9064178,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,695446,0.055347137452434816
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9159185,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,671851,0.13615611802074837
"CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Training data capitalizing upon the NIH-funded Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as well as recently published guidance documents by the American Heart Association (AHA) and International Society of Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT.) This project will involve a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: bioengineering, advanced heart failure cardiology, cardiac surgery, computer science (machine learning/data mining), medical ethics, and palliative care. Carnegie Mellon University, one of the Nation's leading institutions for Computer Science will coordinate this project to assure a productive collaboration with four clinical sites: Allegheny Health Network (Pittsburgh), U. Colorado Denver, Duke University, and Harvard/Brigham & Women's hospital. By achieve consensus amongst stakeholders, we hope to assure the acceptance of CORA into practice and ultimately improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of the treatment of end-stage heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a debilitating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions.

"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9133363,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2016,157765,0.06463335086927145
"CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring ReThink Medical, Inc. proposes to develop an ambulatory version of the physiologic monitoring technology it validated in Phase I, the CorBand. The CorBand is designed to track key physiologic parameters that are predictive of cardiac decompensation, to detect the early stages of decompensation, and to relay both the physiologic data and generated alerts to relevant caregivers with the end goal of reducing hospitalizations by enabling proactive/preventative care in the heart failure population. Heart failure effects 5.8 million individuals in the US and the costs associated are approaching $40 billion annually. This technology will not only improve the quality of life for heart failure patients, but also help to reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that puts emphasis on preventative care through health monitoring technologies. Our specific aims include (1) manufacturing a robust version of the device for use in two large, long term, ambulatory studies. It will be validated using patients who have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity levels, and fluid index derived from the CorBand will be compared with data collected from CIEDs manufactured by Medtronic and Boston Scientific and analyzed for correlation. (2) The CorBand will be deployed in a large ambulatory population of HF patients. We will collect the patient's clinical notes and note hospitalization events along with remote physiologic data from the CorBand. We will use this data to further build a predictive model for cardiac decompensation using a number of machine learning approaches. In aim (3), we will perform a controlled study on a population of HF patients. All the subjects will wear the CorBand; we will use the data from half the subjects to predict decompensation events, provide that information to subject's caregiver in order to provide preventative care. The other half will receive usual care. We will then examine the number of HF related hospitalizations in both groups to evaluate the ability of the CorBand to reduce hospitalizations. Our goal is to simplify the management of heart failure while improving the quality of care of the patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel, non-invasive multi-parameter sensor with telemetry for monitoring patients with heart failure combined with an algorithm for detecting early-stage cardiac decompensation with a goal of preventing hospitalizations.",CorBand: A novel wearable wrist sensor for heart failure remote monitoring,9202845,R44HL125001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Boston', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cloud Service', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Edema', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Office Visits', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'clinical decision-making', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'heart rate variability', 'hemodynamics', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment group']",NHLBI,"RETHINK MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2016,1009410,0.11398753333732536
"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.        ",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9112221,R21AG051077,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Bioenergetics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardium', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'exercise intolerance', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation management', 'respiratory', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,190640,-0.020301413426358658
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9115219,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,1900214,0.09219791086780918
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9004651,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,658634,0.08836271528162085
"Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,9144768,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2016,158304,0.08485787310122608
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.            ",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,8816208,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'improved', 'interest', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2015,234571,0.04275609781865261
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.            ",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,8875394,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2015,634258,0.10914854939816439
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8906912,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,685014,0.055347137452434816
"Improving Heart Transplant Allocation to Reduce High Waitlist Mortality in Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding why women awaiting heart transplantation have a higher mortality rate than men. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing and candidacy for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve healthcare and reduce heart transplant waitlist mortality. The objective of this research application is to use a contemporary cohort to evaluate sex differences in heart transplant waitlist mortality and create a survival model that better predicts need for advanced heart failure therapy. The central hypothesis is that sex differences in heart failure mortality among patients awaiting transplantation are due to sex differences in prognostic risk factors. The rationale for the proposed research is that sex differences in prognostic risk factors have been identified in other heart failure cohorts and creation of risk prediction models has successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify sex-specific risk factors for survival in heart failure patients awaitng heart transplantation and changes in risk factors over time using the national registry (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, SRTR), 2) to develop a survival model for patients awaiting heart transplant using the SRTR database, and 3) to validate that the survival model improves prediction of mortality for the general population of patients awaiting transplantation. The approach is innovative because it challenges and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account the differences between women and men to create a heart failure survival model that will lay the foundation to change a ""rule based"" hear transplant allocation system to a state of the art ""survival model based"" system. The survival model will be created with innovative machine learning statistical methods that do not require advance knowledge of interactions between variables or the parametric relation of variables (linearity or non-linearity) to patient survival. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored sex differences in prognostic risk         factors despite known sex differences in heart failure survival. Furthermore, by creating the first heart failure survival model that includes sex specific risk factors and modern medical/device therapy with adequate representation of women and men we will be significantly advancing the heart failure field. This model, which is derived from our national transplant registry, will improe survival prediction for advanced heart failure patients and can be used to inform and enhance organ allocation policy in the United States. Clinical heart failure studies can also be designed i the future to include women with similar risk of mortality to men in order to improve treatment for both sexes. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because women have a higher mortality rate than men while awaiting heart transplantation and the factors contributing to this disparity have not been identified. Thus the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission to better characterize patients with advanced heart failure and improve health care for both genders.",Improving Heart Transplant Allocation to Reduce High Waitlist Mortality in Women,9125416,R56HL125420,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Databases', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waiting Lists', 'Woman', 'base', 'candidate selection', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'empowered', 'expectation', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'men', 'mortality', 'organ allocation', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'sex', 'time use', 'transplant registry', 'working group']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R56,2015,285869,0.10282276298127613
"CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Training data capitalizing upon the NIH-funded Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as well as recently published guidance documents by the American Heart Association (AHA) and International Society of Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT.) This project will involve a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: bioengineering, advanced heart failure cardiology, cardiac surgery, computer science (machine learning/data mining), medical ethics, and palliative care.

"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,8921191,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2015,159162,0.06463335086927145

"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.                ","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",8864355,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'novel', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,1974550,0.09219791086780918
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction).

"Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,8925840,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2015,158282,0.08485787310122608
"High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging of myocardial perfusion (heart muscle blood flow) at rest and stress allows physicians to detect disease and predict risk in millions of patients in the US each year, but it is currently limited by the need of visual interpretation, which is dependent on doctor's experience. The investigators propose to develop and validate an automated, highly-accurate and objective computer system which will outperform even experienced physicians in interpreting these images using latest generation scanners and novel machine learning computer tools. The computer will be able to better select patients needing treatment and automatically indicate the normal stress-scan immediately, and more accurately than physicians allowing automatic cancellation of the rest imaging, when not needed; this will result in large healthcare savings and reduced radiation to the patients.            ",High Performance Automated System for Analysis of Fast Cardiac SPECT,8762268,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Stress', 'Stress Tests', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,653934,0.055347137452434816
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,8725658,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2014,31657,0.06463335086927145

Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heart failure are hospitalized three million times annually for other causes. These hospitalizations are associated with poor quality of care and high morbidity and mortality. We propose to leverage health information technology to improve outcomes for these patients by creating a novel system of reminders to ensure that hospitalized patients with heart failure receive guideline recommended care.            ",Health Information Technology in Heart Failure Care,8805722,K08HS023683,[' '],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K08,2014,158241,0.08485787310122608
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes.

"Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) affects a large fraction of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. It is associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity, and also results in longer and more expensive hospital stays. While treatments such as prophylactic administration of beta-adrenergic blockers and amiodarone can reduce the incidence of PAF, existing tools to match patients to treatments that are appropriate for their risk need to be improved. Many high-risk patients may benefit from more aggressive treatment than they receive presently. Conversely, many low-risk patients are currently treated in excess of their actual risk of developing PAF. The aim of our research is to develop novel computational markers that can be used to risk stratify patients undergoing cardiac surgery for PAF. Our research uses sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques to discover information in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal related to autonomic and impulse conduction abnormalities. We describe how this information can be combined with existing metrics to identify high risk patients. In addition, we propose the creation of a large public dataset of ECG signals with detailed patient meta-data and outcomes for research by the broader scientific community on predicting PAF. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To develop a public database with ECG signals and detailed patient metadata for research on predictive PAF. We will collect ECG data from over 900 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the University of Michigan Medical Center during the first 12 months of this project with an expected PAF incidence of around 30%. We will share this data and other clinical information (i.e., demographics, comorbidities, laboratory reports, information related to the procedure, and the outcome of PAF) in a de- identified manner with the broader research community through PhysioNet; and (2) To develop and validate novel ECG-based risk markers for PAF. We will explore metrics based on the sympathovagal modulation of the heart, e.g., heart rate turbulence (HRT) and deceleration capacity (DC), which have shown recent promise in predicting ventricular arrhythmias. We will also develop new metrics based on the shape of the ECG to assess atrial myocardial instability. These approaches will be validated on the data collected in Aim 1, and will be used to develop models based on non-parametric machine learning techniques to accurately assess PAF risk.           Postoperative atrial fibrillation commonly occurs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft or valve repair). It is associated with an increased risk of both mortality and morbidity, and increases the cost of hospitalization significantly. Successful management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery therefore relies on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent this event. We propose to develop low-cost, and widely applicable methods that would improve the ability of physicians to identify patients at high risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation. They key concept for this proposal is that ECG signals contain valuable information that can help predict high or low risk cases using sophisticated techniques from signal processing and machine learning. This information can be used to develop clinical tools to improve management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In addition to developing these tools, we also propose the creation of a large public database that can help other researchers with an interest in predicting postoperative atrial fibrillation.",Exploring the Feasibility of Computational Markers to Predict Atrial Fibrillation,8484439,R21LM011026,"['Address', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Amiodarone', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Blinded', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deceleration', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Incidence', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Marker', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Universities', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'millisecond', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'repaired', 'tool', 'valve replacement']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2013,152303,0.045111379756262
"CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY This project aims to produce and beta-test a clinical decision support application for end- stage heart failure, titled CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System. It will be designed for patients with progressive heart failure who may eventually become candidates for ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy. The software will be build upon existing machine learning and data mining technology, developed by the PI and colleagues, designed to predict 90-day mortality following VAD implantation. This Phase- 1 effort will entail development of graphic user interfaces for both patients and clinicians to incorporate personalized prognostic information into a functional decision-support utility. The inference algorithm will also be expanded to encompass adverse events, and risk of readmission. In this Phase-1 feasibility project, CHRiSS will be programmed and beta-tested at West Penn Allegheny Health System (WPAHS). This will entail semi- structured interviews to collect relevant expert knowledge, and mining the electronic medical records (EMR) to calibrate the prognostic algorithm to the institution-specific data. Successful completion of this Phase I project will lead to a multi-center trial in which the software is fully validated. Ultimate succes of this project will result in a software application that will optimize the benefit of VAD therapy to public health, while reducing cost by reducing the unacceptably high rate of adverse events and unnecessary readmissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Heart-assist devices are becoming more commonly used to treat people with severe cardiac failure - who otherwise have few options to return to a normal life. It is estimated that tens of thousands of Americans could benefit from this therapy annually; however, only a few thousand are performed per year. This project aims to develop a software application to better inform patients and doctors about the risks and benefits of this therapy. It will assist patients and doctors to work together when weighing options - with respect to both survival and quality of life. The long-term benefits would be to improve the efficiency of delivering this therapy, thereby reducing the cost, and expanding its distribution to the many people that need it.            ",CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System,8592756,R41HL120428,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Businesses', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Foundations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Heart-Assist Devices', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'implantation', 'improved', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability', 'ventricular assist device']",NHLBI,BLENDERHOUSE,R41,2013,150000,0.07233312468163434

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7588839,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'indexing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2009,196375,0.12853636198416218

"A Cardiac Screening Device DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad, long-term objectives and aims of this project are to provide a reliable and easily-used device for qualified health care professionals to screen for and detect heart murmurs produced from congenital and acquired cardiac defects in children and adults. The device will be designed to distinguish between innocent and pathological heart murmurs with a high degree of accuracy.    The applicant organization, Cardiac Screening Partners, is a joint venture between Cardiac Access, Denver, Colorado and Cardionics, Inc., Webster, Texas. Cardiac Access is comprised of physicians and scientists with a past record of research in cardiac screening (specifically in heart murmurs) and artificial neural networks. Cardionics is a developer and manufacturer of medical devices specifically related to heart and lung sound instrumentation and software.       The proposed research is designed to gather heart sound data from approximately 1600 in children (phase I) and later in adults (phase II). The data will be analyzed using state of the art digital signal analysis processing techniques and custom artificial neural network algorithms. The goal of Phase I research is to build on the success of the preliminary work done by our consultants by further refining and training of artificial neural network algorithms for accuracy in differentiating between innocent and pathologic heart murmurs. n/a",A Cardiac Screening Device,6644431,R43HL073616,"['arrhythmia', ' artificial intelligence', ' child (0-11)', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' electronic recording system', ' heart disorder diagnosis', ' heart function', ' heart sonography', ' human subject', ' sound', ' sound frequency']",NHLBI,CARDIAC SCREENING PARTNERS,R43,2003,99723,0.11699947226822777
"Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under one year old without any apparent warning signs.  It is the leading cause of death of infants between the age of one month and one year in the developed countries. Previous studies have indicated that SIDS victims may suffer from cardiorespiratory failure, which reflects immaturity of autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Heart variability (HRV) has been shown to be a noninvasive and inexpensive way to assess the ANS. Increased heart rate and decreased heart rate variability have been observed in SIDS victims. While it is unclear whether there is a relationship between SIDS and infants who have apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) like apnea and bradycardia, there is a desire to gain a better understanding of the nature of ALTE, their frequency and severity, and the ability of home monitors to detect events and provide an alarm. The Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation (CHIME) study group, formed by NIH, sought to study these issues through the collection of a massive clinical database, which includes physiological, signals from 529 infants recorded in polysomnographic (PSG) studies. The infants were then studied several months using a home monitor which recorded life-threatening events. A classification is available regarding which infants had verified, apparent life-threatening events. Given the wealth of information linking SIDS and heart rate variability (HRV), we desire to investigate whether heart rate variability is effective predictor for life-threatening events. This research will investigate whether HRV can differentiate infants at risk for future apparent life-threatening events (FALTE). First statistical methods will be used to determine if there is significant difference in HRV between normal and FALTE infant groups. Next, the major goal is to design a method to classify infants using HRV, exploring various prediction models including logistic regression, decision tree, and neural networks. The relationship between HRV parameters and all the affected factors will also be studied to provide a clearer understanding of the parameters, and to help determine how to use HRV as a classifier. Successful prediction of infants with future apparent life-threatening events could have clinical significance and provide physicians with an opportunity for treatment.   n/a",Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data,6619652,R03HD042479,"['apnea', ' autonomic nervous system', ' bradycardia', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' infant human (0-1 year)', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' patient monitoring device', ' polysomnography', ' statistics /biometry', ' sudden infant death syndrome']",NICHD,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,78500,0.030083444693649052

"HEART RATE RECOVERY AND MORTALITY  Although there has been considerable attention paid to the                                                                               prognostic significance of the heart rate rise during exercise, only recently        has it been noted that the heart rate fall after exercise, or ""heart-rate            recovery,"" may be an even more powerful predictor of outcome. Heart-rate             recovery after exercise is a consequence of central reactivation of vagal tone.      As impaired parasympathetic function has been associated with increased risk of      death, our hypothesis is that an impaired heart-rate recovery is a powerful and      independent predictor of mortality. Our group recently published the first           report linking heart-rate recovery to long-term mortality in the New England         Journal of Medicine. The proposed project will extend upon that report by            determining the optimal definition of heart-rate recovery, by showing that an        abnormal heart-rate recovery is an independent predictor of mortality in             diverse patient groups, and by developing accurate survival models that              incorporate heart-rate recovery. The overall aim of this project is to use           heart-rate recovery to substantially improve the prognostic value of the             exercise test. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Derive biologically         meaningful mathematical models of heart-rate recovery. Data from over 20,000         patients who have undergone exercise testing at Cleveland Clinic Foundation          between 1990 and 1998 will be used; all of these patients had their tests            performed on exercise workstations which recorded heart rates every 10 seconds       during and after exercise. Heart-rate recovery measures will be the difference       between heart rate at peak exercise and heart rate at different points during        recovery. Modeling will be based on exponential families, using stepwise             selection, bootstrapping, and information theory approaches. Correlates of           different patterns of heart rate recovery will be determined. 2) Using the           results of modeling of heart-recovery derived from the work in Specific Aim 1,       determine a prognostically defined optimal definition of abnormal heart rate         recovery and demonstrate that an abnormal heart rate recovery is a powerful and      independent predictor of mortality in diverse patient groups. Data from              exercise tolerance tests of over 40,000 patients studied at the Cleveland            Clinic Foundation between 1990 and 1999 will be analyzed. Statistical methods        to be used will include the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier product limit method and      the Cox proportional hazards model with bootstrap validation, which will             include use of the random forest technique. 3) Using completely parametric           techniques. develop predictive survival models in which heart-rate recovery is       included along with clinical data and other exercise findings, including             exercise capacity and heart rate changes during exercise. The advantages of the      parametric technique include: a) it allows for modeling of nonproportional           hazards that may permit differential strength of effect at different follow-up       times for different sets of risk factors; b) it generates absolute risk, not         just relative risk; and c) it permits patient-specific prediction. All the data      needed for this project are already electronically available; that fact, along       with the work already done, lends confidence to the feasibility of this              project.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",HEART RATE RECOVERY AND MORTALITY,6530749,R01HL066004,"['cardiovascular stress test', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' heart function', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' human mortality', ' information theory', ' long term survivor', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' parasympathetic nervous system', ' prognosis', ' statistics /biometry', ' vagus nerve']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC FOUNDATION,R01,2002,222000,0.06112396731410325

All the data      needed for this project are already electronically available; that fact, along       with the work already done, lends confidence to the feasibility of this              project.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",HEART RATE RECOVERY AND MORTALITY,6223938,R01HL066004,"['cardiovascular stress test', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' heart function', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' human mortality', ' information theory', ' long term survivor', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' parasympathetic nervous system', ' prognosis', ' statistics /biometry', ' vagus nerve']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC FOUNDATION,R01,2001,222000,0.06112396731410325
"MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS Catheter ablation is a medical procedure that involves the destruction of        small volumes of heart tissue with radiofrequency energy.  To be                 successful, catheter ablation requires precise localization of the tissue        to be destroyed. To accomplish this in a typical ablation procedure, five        catheters containing a total of 19 electrode pairs are utilized to record        potentials (called electrograms) from spatially distinct locations within        the heart throughout the cardiac cycle. Experienced cardiologists                interpret the electrograms to locate the conduction pathways responsible         for the arrhythmia. The pathways are destroyed by applications of                radiofrequency energy, thus treating the arrhythmia.                                                                                                              Ablation procedures are performed by highly trained and experienced              cardiology sub-specialists yet the massive amount of data produced during        these procedures creates a data overload problem that can impede the             performance of even the best practitioners. This may be evidenced by (1)         overlooking important signal features, (2) misinterpreting the signals,          and (3) misinterpreting catheter locations in the heart, all of which may        lead to increased procedure duration and/or applications of radiofrequency       energy to the wrong part of the heart.                                                                                                                            The purpose of this project is to develop a model-based system for               interpreting intracardiac electrograms in near real-time. The system is          intended to assist physicians in ""making sense"" of the enormous amounts of       data recorded during a cardiac electrophysiology study. New computer             algorithms for reasoning about the time- and space-varying nature of             intracardiac electrograms from underlying causal models of the heart will        be developed. The models can be represented as a graph of nodes connected        by arcs. The nodes represent specific an atomic regions of the heart while       the arcs represent the connections between the regions.                                                                                                           The analytic approach will be a variation of the hypothesize-and-test            paradigm. The control loop will be based on the ""tracking"" concept whereby       models will be tracked as long as the data supports the model. Rule-based        knowledge will be utilized to generate models based on the observed data.        The output of the system will be a series of ladder diagrams describing          the data. In the event that the data admits more than a single explanatory       model, ladder diagrams will be generated for all created models.                                                                                                  This proposal is an extension of the applicant's graduate and post-              doctoral project, which used the same approach to the simpler domain of          the interpretation of the body-surface electrocardiogram. The domain of          this proposal is more complex because it adds reasoning with a more              detailed three dimensional cardiac model to the temporal reasoning               required for previous work. Also, this domain requires the ability to            account for simultaneous activation of the heart at multiple locations,          which was performed at a rudimentary level in the previous work.                                                                                                  This project is important for three reasons: (1) it offers new knowledge-        based algorithms for reasoning about time- and space-varying data, (2) a         comprehensive and extensible model of the cardiac conduction will be             created that incorporates the spatial resolution necessary for                   interpreting intracardiac electrograms, and (3) a software tool such the         one proposed may help clinicians improve the quality of health care.              n/a",MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS,6126011,R29LM006004,"['arrhythmia', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' electrocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' heart conduction system', ' human data', ' interactive multimedia', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development']",NLM,SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R29,2000,149839,0.10293032319338792
"Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a serious but increasingly treatable cause of heart failure. Autopsy studies have estimated the prevalence of CA at approximately 25% of all octogenarians, and 15 to 20% of patients with aortic stenosis. Despite the increasing prevalence of CA within the general population and specific subpopulations, its diagnosis as a cause of heart failure is hampered by under recognition and subsequent underdiagnosis in clinical practice. Data suggest that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 2 years and that patients report seeing an average of 5 physicians prior to establishing a definitive diagnosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) testing is the most common initial evaluation because of its wide availability. A recent utilization review in the Medicare population indicated over 7 Million echocardiographic tests are performed each year accounting for $1.2 Billion in healthcare costs. TTEs provide comprehensive information about cardiac structure and function, yet complexity of interpretation has limited its screening performance in patients with CA, and diagnosis can be challenging. Thus, our group seeks to offer a computer vision and machine learning based TTE analysis and screening solution for CA. We are uniquely positioned for accelerated development with a cohort of 359 patients with confirmed CA and 4,862 controls. In Phase I, we will build a deep learning neural network-based image processing pipeline. It maps the TTE sequence into a 2-dimensional space that allows for the identification of the 4-chamber peak diastolic and peak systolic images within the cardiac heartbeat cycle. This will enable our screening model to recognize regional myocardial wall motion changes and hypertrophic patterns that characterize amyloidosis in comparison to controls with normal cardiac function. The operational point defining the performance characteristics of our screening-oriented model (including sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value) will be optimized using an average weighted accuracy (AWA) approach which accounts for CA disease prevalence along with a desired false positive and false negative tradeoff. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal to build and deploy an automated TTE analysis tool, and to evaluate it in a multi- center clinical study. This sets the stage for our long-term goal to implement a computer assisted TTE screening solution to improve identification and by extension care of patients with cardiac amyloidosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE While non-invasive echocardiography is a first line tool for diagnosis for many cardiovascular symptoms, it is underutilized for less common diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis which recently has been shown to be increasingly prevalent in general and specific subpopulations. In this project, we will develop and validate a novel computer-assistive echocardiographic analysis tool to recognize the presence of cardiac amyloidosis. It is our hope that this technology will enhance the screening and subsequent diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, ultimately, leading to improved patient outcomes.",Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis,10081836,R43HL154896,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Laboratories', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Multi-site clinical study', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Myocardial', 'Octogenarian', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Utilization Review', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'case control', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genetic analysis', 'heart function', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'point of care', 'screening', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2020,249373,0.09716793261283285
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9739345,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,687210,0.12088371494291192
"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,9849333,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2020,161047,0.02647835218700448
"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk.

"Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development PROJECT SUMMARY A major unanswered question is how chromatin topology coordinates human development and cellular differentiation, and how genome folding is differentially regulated in human disease. It is thought that three- dimensional (3D) chromatin organization is driven by transcriptional regulators, but fundamental mechanisms of this regulation as it relates to disease-relevant human cells have not been well explored. We propose to elucidate the temporally dynamic 3D nucleome (4DN) that underlies human cardiac differentiation, its molecular underpinnings, and the impact of mutations that underly defective 4DN organization in human congenital heart disease (CHD). CHDs are the most common birth defect and arise from abnormal heart development. The genetic basis of CHD is largely mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers (e.g. WDR5, KMT2D) and transcription factors (TFs, e.g. TBX5, GATA4), many of which also cause adult-onset arrhythmias. The impact of CHD mutations on the 4DN has not been explored. We hypothesize that 3D genome folding is highly regulated during cardiac differentiation and is impacted by disease-causing mutations in transcriptional regulators and non-coding elements. We will use iPS cell models and machine learning to elucidate dynamic 3D chromatin organization in human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells during normal and diseased cardiac differentiation. We propose 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Establish a kilobase-scale 4D map of genome folding in human cardiomyocytes (CM) and endothelial cell (EC) differentiation. We will use directed differentiation of human iPS cells towards the two major cell types of the developing heart: CMs and ECs, and using microC across a fine time course of differentiation we will define at kilobase scale the 3D organization of the genome, capturing the states of developmental intermediates and the final differentiated cells. This aim will generate an essential integrated 4DN template for discovery in cardiac differentiation. In Aim 2: we will Determine the regulatory and disease-related basis for cardiac 3D chromatin organization. We will perform microC in iPS cell lines with CHD-associated mutations in transcriptional regulators, differentiated into CMs and ECs. These findings will establish the degree to which CHD is caused by abnormal genome folding and chromatin states, with important relevance to other human cardiovascular diseases. Finally, Aim 3 will address High-throughput screening of millions of CHD and synthetic non- coding mutations with a deep-learning model of dynamic genome folding. We will build a deep-learning model predicting 3D chromatin contact frequencies across cardiac differentiation at kilobase-resolution. By introducing thousands of CHD patient deletions and other non-coding mutations in silico, we will prioritize variants likely to interact with transcriptional regulators to cause disease through disrupted genome folding. Several candidates will be validated in engineered iPS cells differentiated into CMs and ECs. These results will provide a novel platform for computational discovery of disease variant impact across diverse human diseases PROJECT NARRATIVE Congenital heart defects are present in 1-2 out of 100 births, and are caused by mutations in genes that may control the 3-dimensional organization of chromosomes. We will use human cellular models and Artificial Intelligence to understand how chromosome organization is controlled during heart development and altered by disease processes. This will reveal fundamental concepts of gene regulation and may lead to a better understanding congenital heart defects towards improving diagnosis and treatment.",Genetic determinants of 4D genome folding in human cardiac development,10118056,U01HL157989,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'CCCTC-binding factor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'GATA4 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Diseases', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Development', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'SMARCA2 gene', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cardiogenesis', 'cell type', 'cohesin', 'computational platform', 'congenital heart disorder', 'deep learning', 'disease-causing mutation', 'high throughput screening', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell model', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,J.

"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation.",Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation,9973517,R01EB028278,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Canada', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Catheters', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Ensure', 'Esophageal Fistula', 'Family suidae', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Microbubbles', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'Navigation System', 'Necrotic Lesion', 'Ontario', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Radial', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Surgical Instruments', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'dexterity', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'novel', 'radio frequency', 'real time monitoring', 'robot assistance', 'therapy outcome', 'time use']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,437331,0.06820322681920916
"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10034460,R01HL153447,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Echocardiography', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'High Prevalence', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mission', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Mitral Valve Prolapse', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Prevention', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Screening procedure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'risk prediction model', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,810751,0.033706315864120553
"Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes ABSTRACT Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high healthcare expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identiﬁcation of diabetic patients at high-risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufﬁciently studied problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to per- form early identiﬁcation of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multi-dimensional temporal nature of pa- tient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identiﬁed electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning–based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high- risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multi-site study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic patients are risk of developing diabetic heart disease which can lead to high healthcare expenditure, high resource utilization, and poor patient outcomes. Existing diabetic risk prediction models can suffer from poor calibration and predictive accuracy.

"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy. Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 2-5 million Americans, causing stroke, rapid heart beats, heart failure and even death. In this project, the applicant will apply numerical analysis and machine learning to detailed data acquired from patients undergoing therapy, to better define individual biological types of AF, which may provide a foundation for personalized patient-tailored diagnosis and therapy.",Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation,9995302,R01HL149134,"['Ablation', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dizziness', 'Drug Controls', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'voice recognition', 'voltage']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,785591,0.022594100603140443
"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10079904,R44HL144297,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Auscultation', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Eko', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart murmur', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cloud software', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2020,938347,0.009313241345493278
"Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health problem affecting over 5 million people in the US leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Therapy for this epidemic is suboptimal, with success of 30-70% at 1 year for most therapies. Despite great advances in understanding potential AF mechanisms, these insights have not yet translated into better AF therapy. The scientific focus of the project centers on the issue of identifying novel phenotypes for the heterogeneous conditions that currently fall under the rubric of AF. Machine learning is an approach well-suited to identify novel classifications from large diverse data sets that are traditionally difficult to separate. I will use machine learning and computational methods to analyze detailed clinical, structural, cardiac electrophysiological and biochemical features in patients with AF, to better predict responders and non-responders to various therapies. This may enable prospective guidance to tailor personalized therapy. In performing this project, I will grow as a physician-scientist focused on patient-oriented research in atrial fibrillation. The specific aims of the scientific project are as follows: First, I will create a novel disease taxonomy for AF that classifies patients successfully treated by risk factor modification, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or diverse approaches to ablation, using computational methods and supervised learning on large training data from my collaborators. I will assess the predictive efficacy of these disease partitions in a testing cohort of patients referred for treatment of AF. Second, I will use advanced techniques in machine learning and patient-level analyses to explain why a certain strategy may fail or succeed in an individual, paving the way for clinical use. Third, in a pilot prospective clinical study, I will assess the feasibility and accuracy of these machine learning models. The findings from these experiments may provide an immediate clinical impact by delivering AF therapy options in a patient-specific manner that optimizes benefit while reducing risk. In addition, under the balanced and expert mentorship provided by this award, I will gain the necessary computational modelling, clinical research design and biostatistical methodology experience to design comprehensive studies and be competitive for independent funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder in adults, which may lead to significant morbidity, mortality and economic burden. The results of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy remain suboptimal, despite the fact that mechanistic data in patients are increasing on atrial structure, electrophysiology and clinical risk factors yet are rarely used to individualize AF therapy to each patient. In this project, computational methods and machine learning are proposed to harmonize large amounts of data, including clinical factors, imaging studies and cardiac signals, to provide tools to devise an individualized AF management strategy.",Deep Neural Networks To Treat Atrial Fibrillation,9995010,K23HL145017,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biometry', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Flecainide', 'Freedom', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life Style Modification', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nonpharmacologic Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Work', 'clinical center', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diverse data', 'dofetilide', 'economic implication', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'functional outcomes', 'heart rhythm', 'imaging study', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,0.03667222780135927
"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony.

Patients with NCCM are at increased risk of heart failure, stroke, severe rhythm irregularities and death. Current imaging techniques cannot differentiate pathological from benign hypertrabeculation. In addition, current echo/MRI-based criteria of NCCM lead to over-diagnosis of NCCM, provide no prognostic value, and lead to implantation of defibrillators (ICD) and the use of anticoagulation without a positive benefit in many otherwise healthy individuals with non-compacted myocardium. For a growing population diagnosed with NCCM there is an urgent need for better risk stratification to appropriately allocate (or safely withhold) these impactful preventive measures. Our international consortium combines expertise in myocardial disease, cardiac imaging and advanced computer analytics from 5 centers dedicated to the care of patients with cardiomyopathies, and has the ultimate goal to improve care of patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize that comprehensive analysis of clinical, genetic, structural and functional information will improve risk stratification. In addition, we hypothesize that detailed structural analysis will allow for differentiation of pathological and benign patterns of non-compaction. In a large cohort of adult patients with suspected NCCM we will perform in-depth phenotyping, including clinical information, pedigree data, genetics, echocardiography and MRI, and follow patients for up to 3 years. We will apply machine-learning based analytics to develop predictive models and compare their performance to currently used models and treatment criteria. Secondly, in a subset of patients we will perform high-resolution cardiac CT for detailed structural characterization of the myocardial wall. Novel analytical methods will be developed to characterize the 3D architectural complexity based on pathophysiological hypothesis, but also using hypothesis-free analyses of raw images using deep learning techniques. In addition, we will investigate associations between myocardial structure and regional contractile function, as assessed by echo and MRI. The aim of this proposal is to identify a structural signature associated with pathological non-compaction and improve developed risk prediction models. This international consortium dedicated to NCCM will be the first to collect genetic and multi-modality imaging data. Discovery of pathological structural signatures through innovative imaging techniques, in relation to myocardial contractility, will advance our understanding of NCCM. There is an urgent clinical need for diagnostic techniques that detect pathological non-compaction and identify patients at risk of devastating complications. This study is clinically relevant because the developed predictive models may permit more effective, personalized preventive care in a growing number of individuals diagnosed with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to the public health because recognition of pathological myocardial non- compaction and identification of patients at risk for embolic stroke, ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death will allow for more effective use of life-saving measures, but also avoid unnecessary ICD implantations and anticoagulation in healthy individuals with benign hypertrabeculation. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission that pertains to the discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.",International Consortium for Multimodality Phenotyping in Adults with Non-compaction,9977674,R01HL146754,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Anticoagulation', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defibrillators', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Fractals', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular non-compaction', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Nature', 'Non-compaction cardiomyopathy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive therapy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Savings', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'embolic stroke', 'genetic pedigree', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sudden cardiac death', 'thrombogenesis', 'young adult']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,805761,0.013086979016317916
"Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data Characterizing Patients at Risk for Sepsis Through Big Data SUMMARY The goal of this KL2 research proposal is create an extension of an existing data-driven sepsis algorithm, the artificial intelligence sepsis expert (AISE), by forecasting the type and sequence of sepsis-specific organ failure using clinical data from the electronic medical record, then identifying the incremental benefit received by adding high-resolution data derived from cardiovascular waveforms (arterial waveform and electrocardiographic waves), and small molecule metabolite data over time to provide some mechanistic context. The most important data (features) used in real-time from AISE will be used as inputs for a fuzzy k- means clustering algorithm (“Saving Organs from Sepsis”, or SOS) using retrospectively-collected data, designed to better characterize patients at risk for sepsis by their organ failure. I have selected three organs in particular: shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal component analyses (PCA) data from 2,375 ICU patients with sepsis will be projected onto a novel visual representation for patient phenotyping based on risk of (trajectory toward) different types of organ failure. I will identify if this SOS algorithm can accurately forecast new organ failure within 12 hours based on SOS. To better understand the impact of specific features on organ failure, I will test the ability of each high- resolution features, and metabolomics data to forecast septic shock. Among those who develop septic shock, I will measure all nine high-resolution features from the beginning of the ICU stay up to shock onset and compare those changes to those who develop sepsis but not septic shock, and those who do not develop sepsis. I will then see if the collective addition of high-resolution data improves performance of septic shock forecasting. Finally, I will conduct a prospective observational study to collect metabolomic information in a 60- patient study to identify the incremental improvement of adding metabolomics data to SOS for predicting septic shock, over SOS with just EMR and waveform data. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for further career development and NIH-funding. The long-term goal would be to build a model that optimizes the timing of appropriate therapy, thus decreasing the incidence of sepsis and associated organ failure. As a K23 candidate, I will use this award to acquire formal didactic training and more hands-on experience in machine learning, signal processing, metabolomics analysis. I will seek focused training that will complement my experience as a clinical trialist so that I can design high-quality studies to contribute to Big Data analytics in critical care research and practice. My overarching career goal is to become a leader in the application of Big Data analysis of critically ill patients to predict progression of disease, specifically sepsis. The Emory environment is an ideal place to develop these capabilities. Emory Healthcare houses over 200 medical, surgical, and subspecialty ICU beds, many of which are “wired” to store streaming data. In addition to the physical resources, my development will be enhanced by my superb mentorship team, led by Dr. Greg Martin. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, the body’s response to a life-threatening infection that causes damage to itself, is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, and failure of vital organs is one of the biggest contributors. This project is designed to predict organ failure specific to sepsis using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology using readily-available information, and experimental blood tests.

"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,9981397,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,714763,0.05381663050084948
"Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used to detect and evaluate coronary artery disease. The goal of this project is to reduce the radiation dose and/or scan time of SPECT MPI by a combined factor of 16x, while maintaining or increasing diagnostic accuracy. This would enable SPECT MPI to be performed, e.g., with 4x reduced radiation dose and 4x shorter scan time (~2.5 minutes) than typical protocols. Radiation dose in SPECT MPI has been recognized as an important issue, accounting for ~25% of all radiation exposure to patients in medical imaging. Dose reduction particularly addresses the increased prevalence of obese patients (who receive higher dose) and younger cardiac patients (whose radiation risk is higher due to longer life expectancy). Reduction in scan time would improve comfort for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating body-motion image artifacts and reducing healthcare costs by increasing clinical throughput. We will reduce dose and scan time through innovative image reconstruction methods that involve little or no cost and require no additional patient setup steps. We will employ new respiratory and cardiac motion compensation to reduce image artifacts, as well as new deep learning techniques, which will be used for both respiratory-signal estimation and high-performance denoising. We will methodically optimize these techniques and then validate our algorithms in multicenter clinical reader studies. SA1: Develop clinically practical respiratory motion surrogates for low-count studies. T1: Perfect data- driven respiratory surrogate estimation; T2: Optimize data-driven surrogate estimation at reduced counts; T3: Develop and clinically validate depth-sensing cameras for respiratory and body-motion surrogate estimation; T4: Generalization of data-driven surrogate estimation to SPECT systems not having a CT. SA2: Develop deep-learning reconstruction methods and optimize for diagnostic accuracy and dose/scan time. T1: Post-reconstruction DL denoising algorithms for 3D perfusion images for reduced-count and standard- count studies; T2: DL denoising algorithms for 4D cardiac-gated studies; T3: 4D reconstruction with embedded DL denoising, cardiac motion estimation and correction; and T4: DL reconstruction methods with both RMC and CMC, with projection data binned using respiratory surrogate signals derived in SA1. SA3: Perform multicenter clinical reader studies (6 clinicians, 3 institutions) to validate the new algorithms and compare to current clinically-available methods based on diagnostic performance and repeatability in assessing both perfusion and wall motion defects. T1: In comparison to baseline clinical reconstruction, evaluate added benefit of: a) including attenuation and scatter correction, and b) additionally including RMC; T2: Validate DL for improvement of perfusion and function (wall motion) task performance at full-count levels; and T3: Validate DL for improvement of task performance at reduced counts. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will employ new methods of image reconstruction and processing to reduce radiation dose and scan time in cardiac SPECT imaging, which is used 15-20 million times per year to evaluate coronary artery disease. Dose reduction is important because cardiac SPECT accounts for ~25% of all radiation exposure to the public due to medical imaging; reducing scan time would make SPECT more comfortable for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating image artifacts, as well as and reducing healthcare costs by allowing more patients to be scanned per day. Our goal will be to achieve a combined 16x reduction in dose and scan time while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy, thereby permitting a 4x reduction in dose while reducing scan time from ~10 minutes to ~2.5 minutes.","Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning",10072432,R01HL154687,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Exposure to', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institution', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Life Expectancy', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'heart motion', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'quantum', 'radiation risk', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,786840,0.008858071824711745
"Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning PROJECT ABSTRACT Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over 250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent. In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315 adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML, simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01- level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Heart transplantation is a potentially life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure but unfortunately donors are scarce and only a fortunate minority of patients receive hearts. Current heart allocation policy relies on the intensity of treatment to decide who receives a heart, but this system cannot consistently identify the sickest candidates who stand to benefit the most from heart transplantation. This proposal aims to improve heart allocation by 1) developing a data-driven, objective heart allocation score with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and 2) building novel, more flexible simulation software.",Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning,9871727,K08HL150291,"['Adult', 'American', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk stratification', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'organ allocation', 'organ procurement transplantation network', 'post-transplant', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'skills', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2020,157896,0.11794558877205967
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD.

Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9999582,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2020,190000,0.04275139699990868
"Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning Project Summary/Abstract The objective of our work leverages mobile health technology to develop machine learning models for longitudinal trajectories of recovery like those needed in cardiac rehabilitation. The investigation uses mobile health technology to quantify trajectories of recovery measures, personalizing understanding of exercise capacity and cardiac function. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs reduce cardiovascular mortality risks and improve patient outcomes in such longitudinal fashion, through increased exercise capacity as measured by peak V02 improvements over the course of care. These programs have recently been extended to include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Despite the reduction in mortality and readmissions, participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs remains a challenge, especially in underserved communities because of limited program availability, the distance and transportation access to a program, its hours of operation, as well as a lack of diversity and gender-dominated programs. Home-based programs using smartphones have shown to increase adherence and achieve similar outcomes. While home-based programs also improved resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and levels of physical activity achieved through metabolic equivalent of tasks and peak V02 at the end of the study, users expressed a desire to have individualized education and treatment. Home-based systems still do not achieve real-time interaction, feedback, and monitoring that center-based rehabilitation does through a lack of feedback and necessity of self-reported exertion values. A system is needed that quantify measures of exercise capacity, which can lead to recovery, dynamically throughout the course of treatment. This proposal develops an unobtrusive system, with new mobile health technology sensors, and trains analytic models that allow for personalized quantification of rehabilitation trajectories in HFrEF patients, which can monitor patient adherence and improvement in measures during exercise as well as while at rest. This system investigates the improvement over the course of a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation study and designs trajectories of recovery to understand improvements in peak V02 and exercise capacity in HFrEF patients by also measuring improvements of measurements of heart rate and blood pressure while at rest. This allows for an investigation of additional measures, over time, that may better quantify recovery in HFrEF patients that can be used for center-based rehabilitation or home-based rehabilitation. This can provide a significant enhancement of metrics that define recovery for HFrEF patients with estimations to metrics that are difficult to collect and evaluate. Project Narrative Quantification of trajectories of recovery for patients through wearable mobile health technologies can provide personal understanding of improvements and challenges faced in recovery by patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Such a system will indicate to each patient the improvement in exercise capacity needed to continue preventing any recurrent events, allowing participants to have the understanding and individualized feeling they get from clinic visits and center-based cardiac rehabilitation at home or any other location they wish to participate in recovery activities. The exploration of additional markers of recovery can continue to provide quantification of heart failure conditions useful for clinicians and patients alike.",Estimating Trajectory of Recovery in Cardiac Rehabilitation using Mobile Health Technology and Personalized Machine Learning,10018016,R21EB028486,"['Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'EFRAC', 'Education', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Gender', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'heart function', 'heart rate monitor', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'rate of change', 'sensor technology', 'smart watch', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2020,177045,0.05883173165624227
"Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), characterized by heart failure symptoms with normal ejection fraction, is highly prevalent. However, most HFpEF patients do not respond to standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and there are no clear and uniform diagnostic criteria to stratify and differentiate HFpEF from HFrEF. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need for us to better understand HFpEF at the molecular and system levels. Unbiased approaches such as machine learning (ML) offer a powerful means to tease out the molecular signatures of HFpEF in relevant disease models. The emerging evidence implicates that metabolism and redox homeostasis are two significant disruptions in cellular processes evidenced by clinical symptoms of HFpEF. Previous studies have identified branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic defect as another major metabolic hallmark in heart failure as well as in metabolic disorders. Moreover, BCAA catabolic defects have been demonstrated to directly impact mitochondrial function and elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in oxidative stress-sensitive post-translational modifications (O-PTMs) that govern protein function and pathways. These exciting discoveries lead to our new hypothesis that O-PTM-mediated proteome remodeling is a dynamic and pervasive molecular change in diseased hearts, affecting proteins with central function in cardiac homeostasis and pathophysiology. To investigate the unique molecular features and pathogenic mechanisms of HFpEF, we highlight a novel HFpEF mouse model that incorporates both genetic predisposition for obesity/diabetes and pressure-overload, the two major risk factors for HFpEF, by performing trans-aortic constriction (TAC) in the ob/ob mice. We have also perfected the experimental tools and data analysis platform to provide O-PTM profiling at the whole-proteome level in hearts. Accordingly, we have strategically formulated the following aims according to three phenotypic levels: At the systemic level, Aim 1 will establish and characterize in vivo mouse models of HFpEF vs. HFrEF by cardiac and mitochondrial function as well as redox status. At the organellar level, Aim 2 will conduct targeted proteomics profiling of the cardiac mitochondria and extract O-PTM signatures using ML-based methods to achieve deep phenotyping of HFpEF and HFrEF. This information will then be integrated and enriched in an O- PTM molecular atlas and knowledge graph. At the molecular level, Aim 3 will target the BCAA catabolic pathway to exhaustively scrutinize its role in HFpEF and HFrEF. A multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE HFpEF is highly prevalent, yet there are few effective treatments or clear criteria to differentiate it from HFrEF. We propose to extract molecular signatures unique to HFpEF and HFrEF using a novel HFpEF mouse model and machine learning-based approaches. We anticipate that a multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway,9961660,R01HL146739,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biology', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Cardiac', 'Catabolism', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Defect', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'EFRAC', 'Enzymes', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glucose', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Homeostasis', 'Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Myocardium', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinness', 'Treatment Failure', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'base', 'computational platform', 'constriction', 'effective therapy', 'empowered', 'exhaustion', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'heart function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'knowledge graph', 'men', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'protein function', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,649707,0.05812639454641299
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9997993,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'comorbidity', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support vector machine', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2020,515780,0.025114718403561487
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,9847997,K23HL135274,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Self Administration', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'behavior change', 'big biomedical data', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preempt', 'prevent', 'professor', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,203397,0.09267906526256978
"Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women die each year from CHD. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive imaging modality used for diagnosing CHD and for planning therapeutic interventions. Cardiac CT exams are still challenging to perform due to the beating heart and the need to carefully time the scan based on cardiac phase and based on when the peak iodine contrast enhancement is reached. The overall exam duration and the complexity of performing these exams (contrasted with limited reimbursement levels) have limited patient access to cardiac CT to academic hospitals and specialized cardiac imaging centers. As compared to other CT exams, cardiac CT exams require additional patient preparation time, additional CT scans to track the bolus, and additional contrast agent to avoid missing the peak enhancement.  The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. Initial results show that it is possible to extract cardiac gating information from a few CT projection measurements prior to the diagnostic CT scan, without reconstruction. This is made possible by an innovative combination of fast X-ray tube pulsing and deep learning raw data analysis. This project builds on GE Research's experience with cardiac CT technologies, deep learning algorithms and X-ray tube physics, as well as the strong clinical cardiac CT expertise at the University of California San Diego.  The outcome of this project will be a clinical feasibility study of the autonomous triggering approach, which has the potential to simplify and increase patient access to cardiac CT, while reducing exam time, reducing con- trast agent volume, and ensuring robust image quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus.

"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease. The applicant will develop strategies to identify AF patients who will best respond to each of several therapies, to guide personalized therapy.",The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation,10071621,R01HL083359,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Body Surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Right atrial structure', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,770947,-0.01494912044141118
"Eavesdropping on heart-brain conversations during sleep for early detection and prevention of fatal cardiovascular disease ABSTRACT  The intimate link between the heart, brain and sleep is central to our well-being and ability to meet the demands of life. A majority of cardiovascular (CV) deaths occur in the early waking hours from sleep. For example, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), an extremely prevalent and devastating condition, claims more lives (>350,000/year) in the USA than all disease-related causes of death combined. A defibrillator can prevent SCA, but current clinical strategies are grossly inadequate, both in terms of identifying people at risk and importantly, monitoring and controlling the CV risk. To address this major gap, we are proposing an entirely novel approach for studying heart-brain interactions during sleep. To our knowledge, our compelling new preliminary data and innovative strategy are unprecedented.  In robust preliminary studies of animals and humans, we have identified unique signatures of evolving, potentially fatal, CV disease within electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms that otherwise cannot be detected by current clinical methods and conventional statistics. Our powerful new tools reveal these “hidden” signatures during sleep (i.e., as conscious activity decreases and autonomic control of the heart becomes prominent). This missing link we have identified between the heart, brain, spontaneous intrinsic arousals, and critical CV disease is independent (in multivariate analyses) of sleep disordered breathing (e.g., apnea) and established risk factors. Our novel and highly promising findings may account for the high incidence of CV deaths associated with sleep and have potential for broad application, ranging from animal models to improved reclassification of individuals currently consid- ered “low”, “moderate” or “high” risk in contemporary clinical practice. This is important because asymptomatic individ- uals without advanced CV disease comprise the majority of SCA victims. They also are the ones “missed” by current risk stratification methods and the most challenging to identify. Further, our fundamental new approach to EEG and ECG analysis will add new, clinically valuable, prognostic insight for patients with advanced CV disease (e.g., heart failure). This robust, inexpensive, personalized strategy for identifying who will and will not need lifesaving therapy will also avoid unnecessary procedures and complications, and thus, will provide substantial socioeconomic benefits.  This paradigm-shifting application for a NIH Director’s New Innovator Award incorporates clinical cardiac electro- physiology, critical care and sleep medicine with engineering, mathematics, artificial intelligence, statistical dynamical systems, and molecular, cellular and clinical research to enable early diagnosis and therapy of critical CV disease. Our unique approach for gaining novel mechanistic insight into CV pathology and risk during sleep is likely to spawn new avenues in collaborative multidisciplinary research. Because our new paradigm can be seamlessly incorporated into existing technology readily available in hospitals and clinics, we expect our findings to rapidly transform contem- porary clinical practice in multiple fields. Importantly, the ability to identify and decode “hidden” EEG and ECG signa- tures of early onset of fatal, subclinical CV illness, including SCA, the leading cause of death in the industrialized world, has extraordinary implications for human health and the potential for broad worldwide application. NARRATIVE  The treatment of heart disease after clinical presentation has limited success. Irreversible organ system damage often initiates by the time the patient presents clinically. We seek to introduce, understand and validate a completely new approach for analyzing heart and brain signals to reveal information about evolving critical disease in an individual that otherwise would remain undetected by current clinical methods until catastrophic clinical presentation. If validated, this new paradigm will have extraordinary implications for human health and the potential to open new avenues in research and therapy.",Eavesdropping on heart-brain conversations during sleep for early detection and prevention of fatal cardiovascular disease,10002962,DP2HL157941,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Apnea', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Pathology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Defibrillators', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'body system', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'dynamic system', 'early onset', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized strategies', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,DP2,2020,2407500,0.041527922733118394
"HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model HLS17-12. The US FDA is considering to establish a new cardiac safety assessment approach  defined by a new paradigm called, “Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CIPA)”. The CIPA will 1) assess drug effects on each cardiac ion channel type individually using a high- throughput assay ion channel assays, 2) compute net effect on repolarization and risks for  torsade pointes (TdP) using a mathematical model, and 3) confirm the computational prediction by measuring the drug’s effects on action potentials in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human cardiac myocytes (CMs). This paradigm shift, if successful, could reduce the cost of  cardiac safety analyses by replacing or lowering the requirement to perform an expensive ($2-4 million) thorough QT study during clinical trials. Protecting consumers from drug induced  arrhythmia and sudden deaths is a paramount importance for the regulators and pharmaceutical companies as well as lowing the cost of drug development. Many cardiac safety scientists, however, are skeptical about CIPA’s approach since CMs derived from human iPSCs exhibit a poor excitation-contraction coupling due to their immaturity. In addition, a proposed CIPA mathematical model was developed to simulate electrophysiology of human adult CMs, so there is a mismatch between experimental system and computational tool. To address these concerns, we proposed three specific aims in tw0 phases by following Fast- Track SBIR processes. Phase I feasibility Aim 1 will measure drug-induced changes in AP and CaT using human adult heart slices isolated from human donors. Here we will confirm our  successful handling and analyzing human adult heart slices, which will be based on a recently  published protocol by our collaborator, Dr. Igor Efimov, at George Washington University. After this validation, we will move on to perform the following two studies: Aim 2. Compare drug-induced changes in AP and CaT in NuHearts generated from adult CMs and cardiac fibroblasts from same human donor hearts; Aim 3. Validate and improve the computational models and train an artificial intelligence to predict cardiac safety risks of unknow compounds. After our successful completion proposed projects, we can establish an unprecedented cardiac safety assessment platform that can predict safety issues using a well-trained AI without doing any experiments using human heart slices that are rarely accessible for most of the safety  laboratories or biotech firms. Because nearly one third of drug candidates fails to reach market due to its cardiac safety concerns, a better safety assessment approach without increasing its cost is needed to improve productivity of pharmaceutical industry. The proposed project combines computational and experimental analyses of cardiac safety parameters using adult heart cells isolated from a donor heart and its stem cell derived heart muscle cells to build a better but cost-effective cardiac safety assessment system. A successfully validated system enables drug developers to arcuately predict a new drug’s cardiac safety profile by only running cost-effective experiments using stem cell derived heart muscle cells that are accessible to many drug developers.",HLS-Cardiac Safety AI Trained Human Heart and Micro Heart Model,9948757,R44HL139248,"['3-Dimensional', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Expert Systems', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Laboratories', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Pump', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shipping', 'Ships', 'Slice', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data archive', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'heart preservation', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'mathematical model', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision drugs', 'response', 'safety assessment', 'screening', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'stem cells', 'success']",NHLBI,"INVIVOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2020,861204,0.0620065762326111
"Enabling of a wireless and remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing device through the internet of medical things for heart failure patients Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) biventricular pacemaker with integrated ventricular pressure sensors. Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and home monitoring of vascular pressure through implantable wireless devices have shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce hospitalization of heart failure patients. None of the current solutions connect CRT treatment to remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices within the body. Bionet’s software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than radio frequency (RF) waves and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) 2 Reprogrammable wireless pacing nodes coupled to MEMS pressure sensors; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet. An intelligent CRT device that can be remotely monitored by clinicians in order to optimize therapy using continuous real-time data will lead to improved HF treatment options and informed treatment decisions individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled pacing, recharging, and pressure sensing elements using ultrasounds at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo data and energy transmission for the system, allowing for controlled cardiac pacing using real time blood pressure data. In vivo experiments in porcine models (n=4) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes and acquire real time intraventricular pressure data. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a wireless remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing devices will be developed using new core technology for the internet of medical things. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to allow communication between the different implantable elements and recharge those same elements allowing for miniaturization. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of the heart failure patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Enabling of a wireless and remotely monitored bi-ventricular pacing device through the internet of medical things for heart failure patients,10007981,R43HL149451,"['Acute', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cadaver', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intrabody', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Legal patent', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'Pacemakers', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic intraventricular pressure', 'Population', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tremor', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Ventricular', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'bone', 'cardiac pacing', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'health care economics', 'hospitalization rates', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'personalized decision', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'product development', 'radio frequency', 'software development', 'sonar', 'subcutaneous', 'transmission process', 'treatment optimization', 'verification and validation']",NHLBI,BIONET SONAR,R43,2020,444327,0.04617331074990835
"Charting a New Course for Heart Failure: From Discovery to Data ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Charting a New Course for Heart Failure: From Discovery to Data, organized by Drs. Mansoor Husain, Benoit G. Bruneau and Marc Pfeffer. The conference will be held in Keystone, Colorado from March 1-5, 2020. Heart failure is global health problem of increasing prevalence, high morbidity, and refractory mortality, for which there have been relatively few impactful therapeutic advances. This unique multidisciplinary conference will bring together leading clinicians and scientists to share the latest insights on genetic, environmental, iatrogenic and pathophysiological mechanisms of heart failure. The program includes specific sessions and workshops focused on advances in cardiac fibrosis, immunology, metabolism, regenerative medicine, biomedical engineering, and analytical approaches to large datasets of relevance to this disease. Although the program is diverse, each session will address a scientific frontier in heart failure biology of potential therapeutic relevance and will be framed to address an unanswered, important clinical question. This innovative format is purposefully planned to highlight translational opportunities in heart failure and to provide a forum that encourages dialogue between cardiovascular researchers and trainees with distinct perspectives, but who share a common goal of making an impact in heart failure. This conference will be paired with “New Insights into the Biology of Exercise.” These two Keystone Symposia conferences will share a joint session examining exercise physiology and how it affects cardiac energetics and hypertrophy, which will be of interest to audiences attending either conference. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure is global health problem of increasing prevalence, high morbidity, and refractory mortality, for which there have been relatively few impactful therapeutic advances. However, the larger question of heart failure disease and its underlying mechanisms has resulted in a lack of effective therapies for a patient population which is increasing in size, age and clinical complexity.

"Mentoring in patient-oriented atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular research PROJECT SUMMARY This application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Alvaro Alonso, with protected time and other support to (1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior clinical investigators and graduate students engaged in patient-oriented cardiovascular research; (2) obtain additional training in omics, machine learning, and mentoring best-practices; and (3) advance Dr. Alonso's ongoing research on the risk factors and mechanisms contributing to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Mentoring activities will build upon the ongoing involvement of Dr. Alonso in several training programs at Emory University, including an NHLBI-funded multidisciplinary T32 training grant on cardiovascular health disparities, the research-track Cardiology fellowship program at the School of Medicine, and the Master of Public Health and PhD programs in epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health. Training will focus on cutting-edge methodological areas in rapid development, including integration of omic technologies and machine learning in patient-oriented research, as well as acquisition of skills in academic, research, and clinical mentoring. Finally, this award will support a research project that extends Dr. Alonso's ongoing work on understanding the factors influencing the development of the AF substrate, understanding AF pathophysiology, and preventing AF-related outcomes. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to identify novel AF phenotypes (phenogroups) using extensive clinical and multi-omic data (“phenomapping”), (2) to discover specific risk factors for the different AF phenogroups, and (3) to determine associations of AF phenogroups with selected endpoints (stroke, heart failure, mortality). These research aims will be carried out in the context of the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, an ongoing prospective registry of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in three Emory-affiliated hospitals currently including approximately 7,000 unique individuals with detailed phenotyping, clinical outcomes, and multi-omic markers. In summary, the activities proposed in this application will favorably impact Dr. Alonso's capabilities to conduct cutting-edge and innovative patient-oriented research on cardiovascular prevention and his ability to perform as a highly qualified mentor for junior clinicians pursuing research on clinical cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite progress, atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia, remains a major public health program.

"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,9841436,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,395000,0.019472171018960004
"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction.

"Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advanced heart failure is characterized by progressive debilitating symptoms and repeated hospitalizations that degrade quality of life. There is no one criterion to diagnose advanced heart failure; the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to populations. As such, our knowledge of advanced heart failure is truncated and skewed as it is based on information from referral populations and convenience samples. Enhancing our understanding of the epidemiology, experiences, and outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure is critical to developing interventions to improve care and quality of life. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal leverages diverse data sources and novel applications of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. In Aim 1, we will apply an advanced heart failure definition to a geographically-defined population of individuals with heart failure under the auspices of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We will determine the prevalence of advanced heart failure, examine the demographic and clinical features of the population, and evaluate the timing of its development and association with risk of outcomes. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning techniques to develop computer algorithms (computable phenotypes) to identify patients with advanced heart failure using electronic health record data. We will then leverage the infrastructure of the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) to validate the performance of the computable phenotypes across diverse patient populations. This will enable the accurate and efficient identification of advanced HF for future applications. In Aim 3, we will use the computable phenotype developed in Aim 2 to prospectively identify individuals living with advanced HF. We will then assess their treatment and illness burdens using a combination of surveys and semi-structured qualitative interviews. This information will be used to inform the development of a palliative care intervention that is tailored to the needs of patients with advanced HF. We will assess the acceptability of the tailored palliative care intervention to stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians). The results of these analyses will provide synergistic information to clarify the epidemiology, case mix, burdens, and outcomes of individuals with advanced heart failure. They will provide a prototype palliative care intervention tailored to decrease burden and improve quality of life in advanced heart failure. Finally, the computable phenotype developed can be used to identify patients with advanced HF for future quality improvement programs, observational studies, and interventional research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some patients with heart failure (HF) develop end-stage, refractory disease (advanced HF), characterized by progressive debilitating HF symptoms that interfere with daily life. However, our knowledge of the epidemiology and impact of advanced HF is severely limited because the definition is complex and challenging to apply broadly to diverse populations. In this study, we will evaluate the epidemiology and outcomes of advanced HF in a geographically-defined population, develop computer algorithms that can accurately and efficiently identify advanced HF, and assess the burdens and experiences of patients living with advanced HF to enable the design of new interventions to improve care and quality of life.",Advanced Heart Failure: Epidemiology and Outcomes,9994364,R01HL144529,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Mixes', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Refractory Disease', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Ventricular Function', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'computable phenotypes', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'diverse data', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rural setting']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,746610,0.07527842267669745
"Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred or fibrotic heart tissue plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive, multifaceted imaging modality and is the clinical gold standard for scar and fibrotic cardiac tissue imaging with use of gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, administration of such gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired kidney function? a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. Until recently, GBCA was presumed to be safe in patients with normal kidney function; however, there are emerging data on long-term GBCA retention in the body. We aim to develop two complimentary approaches to reduce GBCA use in myocardial, or cardiac muscle, scar imaging. Initially, we will develop a quantitative risk-benefit model to identify NICM patients with a low chance of having scarred myocardium. Concurrently, we will develop a GBCA-free cardiac MR myocardial tissue probe platform based on AI (MyoProbe.ai) to quantify scarred regions of the heart. To accomplish this, we will develop and evaluate an individualized, patient-specific scar prediction model to reduce GBCA use in NICM patients with different etiologies by training the model to learn to identify whether the patient is likely to have scarring based on non-contrast images. If it is unlikely that a patient has scarring, contrast administration can be avoided. To develop and evaluate MyoProbe.ai for GBCA-free quantification of myocardial scar in CHD patients, we will use AI to integrate signal intensity and heart motion data from MRI images to accurately locate and quantify scar tissue. This information can then be used by cardiologists to diagnose and treat the patient. We will rigorously validate our risk-benefit model and AI myocardial probe platform using retrospectively and prospectively collected cardiac MRI images from multiple healthcare centers, MRI vendors, and magnetic field strengths. Our dataset will include different types of NICM and CHD patient populations to ensure that our work is applicable to patients with many different types of NICM and CHD. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred/fibrotic heart tissue with gadolinium- based contrast agents (GBCA) plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). However, administration of GBCAs prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, contaminates surface and drinking water, is retained in the body long-term, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired renal function– a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. The goal of our study is to reduce or eliminate GBCA use in cardiac MR scar imaging using artificial intelligence (AI) by concurrently developing a quantitative model to identify NICM patients with a low likelihood of scarring and a GBCA-free cardiac MR AI platform to quantify scar tissue.",Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis,10072898,R01HL154744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Fostering', 'Gadolinium', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired Renal Function', 'Impairment', 'Injections', 'Ischemia', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drinking water', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'radiomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,946194,0.04843655991280253
"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing. If successful, this project will reduce the cardiac testing burden and facilitate activation for transplant for patients on the kidney transplant waitlist.",Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates,9871208,K23DK123410,"['Accreditation', 'Age', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Wait Time', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'older patient', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive test', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relative effectiveness', 'response', 'screening', 'skills']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,166536,0.05355409040629108
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9910440,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'comorbidity', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,535600,0.04685929437478486
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,9930135,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,797215,0.04271501162840644
"Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection Project Summary Though cardiac transplantation is a lifesaving intervention, cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) remains a relatively common and serious complication that confers an increased risk of acute graft failure and adverse patient outcomes. For three decades, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with histological grading, as recommended by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has been the broadly applied standard for CAR diagnosis. However, it is widely appreciated that the ISHLT rejection grading standard lacks diagnostic accuracy and has limited ability to discern the mechanism of rejection. These limitations expose patients to risks of both over-treatment and under-treatment, and highlight the unmet need for more accurate and informative approaches to histopathologic analysis of EMB samples. Our team is a leader in computational pathology image analysis with over 200 papers and >30 issued patents in this area. We have already developed and evaluated a computer assisted histopathology grading evaluation (CACHE) scheme which (1) in N=205 patients, had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.95 compared to two cardiac pathologists (mean AUC=0.74) in distinguishing normal from failing hearts and (2) could distinguish low and high ISHLT rejection grades in N=1109 patients with a performance that exceeds that of trained cardiac pathologists. Recognizing the frequent discordance between ISHLT rejection grade and the clinical trajectory of a rejection event, we will further develop and optimize CACHE to identify new “grade agnostic” morphologic biomarkers of clinically serious CAR. Our scientific premise is that morphologic biomarkers prioritized based on their correlation to patients’ clinical trajectories and underlying immunological disease mechanisms will generate an accurate, consistent and informative classifier for diagnosing allograft rejection. In service of this hypothesis, the proposed research will address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize computational image analysis to discover the morphologic biomarkers of rejection-related injury which are needed to develop a classifier capable of assessing the clinical trajectory of CAR. In Aim 2, we will provide mechanistic annotation of biomarkers identified in Aim 1 through correlation with in-situ immunologic markers using custom multi-parameter immunofluorescence panels. In Aim 3, we employ a multicenter, prospective cohort to validate the diagnostic and mechanistic accuracy of the new rejection classifier developed in Aims 1 and 2. Ultimately, development of a more accurate and mechanistically informative tool for morphologic diagnosis of CAR will improve patient outcomes by reducing over- and under- treatment and inspire applications in other organ transplants. Interestingly, development of a superior histologic diagnostic tool will empower development of alternative, biopsy-free diagnostic approaches that have been handicapped by the necessity of comparison with the flawed ISHLT rejection grade as a reference standard. Project Narrative For heart transplant recipients, allograft rejection remains a relatively common and serious complication associated with adverse patient outcomes. Shortcomings of the current rejection grading standard for heart biopsies leads to both over- and under-treatment, accordingly, this proposal will develop and validate a computer assisted rejection grading classifier that is more accurate, consistent and informative for diagnosing heart allograft rejection. Improved diagnostic accuracy will improve patient outcomes, inspire similar applications in other organ transplants and empower development of additional technologies that have been constrained by the current flawed rejection standard.",Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection,10070406,R01HL151277,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allografting', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Graft Rejection', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart-Lung Transplantation', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Injury', 'International', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Legal patent', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'feature detection', 'graft failure', 'heart allograft', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic data', 'population based', 'post-transplant', 'prospective', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,845590,0.08514728763136929
"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hemodialysis patients experience a disproportionately high burden of sudden cardiac death. Medication- provoked sudden cardiac death (i.e. death triggered by QT-prolonging medications) may be preventable and has not been studied enough in this population.

"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system. Our proposal will identify the factors contributing to these population differences in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage.",Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients,9884783,R01HL141892,"['Affect', 'Albumins', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Event', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanics', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liver Failure', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Restrictive Cardiomyopathy', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Update', 'Vibrissae', 'Waiting Lists', 'Woman', 'base', 'cardiac cachexia', 'cardiac device', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'forest', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'post-transplant', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant database', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2020,779535,0.10312402407301699
"Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens ABSTRACT Patients with atrial fibrillation, post-acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism are prescribed antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulants) in dual and triple combinations. These drugs independently cause gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from mucosal defects or vascular abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac patients are the fastest growing at-risk group due to the rapidly aging US population, their high-burden of co-morbidity, frequent antithrombotic polypharmacy and prescription of new antithrombotic drugs with higher incidence of GI adverse events. The real-world GIB risk of antithrombotic agents used in combination in a diverse cardiac population has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated poor performance of existing risk scores (HAS-BLED, CHA2DS2-VASC etc.) for the prediction of non- warfarin antithrombotic drug bleeding; scores frequently used in the clinical setting despite their inaccuracy. Absence of knowledge regarding the real-world risk of antithrombotic-GIB, and the inability to accurately predict which patients will bleed, hampers patient counselling regarding a frequently occurring adverse event which is known to cause morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. We propose to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying GIB risk in a large, geographically diverse cohort of elderly and non-elderly cardiac patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or post-acute coronary syndrome. GIB associated with antithrombotic drug combinations will be stratified by underlying cardiac conditions; incidence rates (events/100 patient-years) and propensity-matched Cox proportional models (with 95% confidence intervals) will be used to estimate outcome. We will examine heterogeneity of safety effects related to age, chronic co-morbidity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction. Machine learning techniques will then be used to derive and validate a highly sensitive algorithm for the prediction of antithrombotic-related GIB. Discovery of such an algorithm is the first step in the future application of a predictive model in any evidence-based clinical delivery platform, such as a decision rule or risk calculator. NARRATIVE Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in cardiac patients is common, deadly and on the rise due to an older population, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used in combination, and availability of new drugs with higher GIB risk than their predecessors. Lack of data regarding the magnitude of GIB and limited knowledge of which patients are most at risk, prevents accurate counselling regarding cardiac drug safety. We will quantify this risk, study risk factors; and use machine learning techniques to derive and validate a clinical algorithm to better predict at-risk patients.",Gastrointestinal Safety of Antithrombotic Drug Regimens,9916670,R01HS025402,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R01,2020,394737,0.04561596408370336
"Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI Project Summary / Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million with a prevalence of 250,00-400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of HF is exercise (aerobic) therapy that has demonstrated various cardioprotective properties to halt and potentially reverse adverse structural remodeling. However, dosing of exercise therapy remains a challenge due to each individual's inherent differences and consequentially, serial non-invasive monitoring of the therapy would be necessary to evaluate the change on structural remodeling. Furthermore, current non-invasive technologies characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of exercise therapy in HF patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of exercise training to cardioprotect against HF by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with cardiac diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). DT-MRI is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current cardiac DT-MRI methods to be applied robustly in a clinical setting. In this project, an innovative 5-min “push button” DT-MRI method will be developed that overcomes such limitations. We also leverage institutional strengths to further quantify the accuracy of in vivo DT-MRI in revealing myocardial microstructure using novel tissue cleared 3D histology. The central hypothesis is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of cardiac DT-MRI to serve as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of HF on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted MRI. The proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-MRI methodology and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of exercise therapy on the microstructural remodeling of HF thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization of dosing exercise therapy. Project Narrative This project ultimately aims at optimizing the non-invasive monitoring of exercise therapy in heart failure patients to potentially improve outcome. The research strategy is designed to systematically develop an innovative cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that overcomes major shortcomings of the conventional methods and aims at immediate clinical translation. Successful completion of this project will result in a clinically robust cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that can effectively monitor the efficacy of exercise therapy and potentially improve treatment of heart failure.",Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI,9946164,R01HL151704,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Histology', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Pacemakers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'RNA marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Pathway', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Tachycardia', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'cardioprotection', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'denoising deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exercise training', 'functional loss', 'heart function', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'preservation', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'reconstruction', 'sedentary', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,673600,0.008278936781633094
"Cloud-based High-throughput Acquisition and Analytics of Zebrafish Electrocardiogram for Cardiac Studies and Drug Development Project Summary Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH SBIR Phase II grant with University of California Irvine is to provide novel systems to assess cardiac electrophysiology in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Heart disease plagues the world as the leading cause of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmic diseases alone contributed about 350,000 deaths annually in the U.S. Although causative genes for some of them have been partially discovered, genetic basis for the majority remains poorly understood. The zebrafish (Dario rerio) model system is an important vertebrate experimental model owing to its small size, low-cost for maintenance, short generation time, amenable and conserved genetics, and optical transparency. Zebrafish have long been used as model system for understanding human cardiac development, disease, and regeneration. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. Owing to the physiological similarities to humans’, zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal model system for drug screening. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves anesthesia causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. Further, data processing and analysis have been done manually, making it impossible to conduct large-scale studies. In this context, we propose to establish a long-term roadmap using multidisciplinary approaches to enable i) novel devices and systems to provide reliable ECG data of multiple fish (both adult fish and larvae) over a long period of time; ii) cloud-based systems to effectively process and interpret as well as study large-scale data; and iii) a host of cardiac studies as well as drug investigations using the zebrafish models and our novel tools. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase II SBIR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of California Irvine will develop novel bioengineering tools to collect and study electrocardiogram of the zebrafish model with high throughput. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based acquisition and analytics in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous cardiac studies and drug screening applications.

"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. We propose to investigate the mechanisms of rearrest during resuscitation to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies that improve outcomes.",Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation,9886863,R01HL142754,"['Acute', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency research', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Ischemia', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Public Health', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'epicardial mapping', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rearrest', 'signal processing', 'translational model']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,668976,0.028401821684307268
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,9895469,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood pressure variability', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2020,172274,0.07214876030466434
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9886260,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2020,143581,0.02131753724873255
"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in stem-cell technology enable patient-derived cells to be turned into functional heart cells, and this is an exciting direction towards personalized medicine; yet, there are many challenges in optimizing these cardiomyocytes to better mimic the real heart – a problem that the proposed engineering tools will help resolve.",Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation,9839658,R01HL144157,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Data', 'Disease model', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'NADH', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'heart cell', 'heart metabolism', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanocarrier', 'optogenetics', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'stem cell technology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'voltage']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,706471,0.06549869925888759
"Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed study is motivated by the public health importance of aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of valvular heart disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Once symptomatic, survival is a dismal 50% at 1-year if left untreated. Clinical symptoms develop once cardiac compensatory mechanisms fail, indicating the need for aortic valve replacement (AVR), but because AS primarily affects the elderly, symptoms are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions, advanced age, or both—resulting in delayed treatment. While most patients that eventually undergo AVR experience improvements in symptoms and survival, nearly half of patients die within the first year after AVR or fail to reap the symptom and health status improvements for which they underwent AVR. Our research suggests that irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury related to delayed treatment contribute to these poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the unmet need for objective and sensitive measures to inform clinical decisions regarding the timing of AVR. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement an omics-based precision medicine approach for identifying patients with severe AS at-risk for irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury who would benefit from earlier AVR, and our central hypothesis is that multi-omic signatures reflective of dimensions of cardiac structure and function will identify irreversible cardiac remodeling and therefore predict the clinical response to AVR. Our prior work and preliminary studies provide strong support for our hypothesis and demonstrate that our experienced multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete the proposed study. We have identified metabolomic signatures that relate strongly to measures of cardiac function and structure and predict mortality after AVR, and also proteomic signatures relating to cardiac function that differentiate severe AS and associate with mortality. Within this proposal, we adopt a longitudinal systems biology approach that leverages the latest in proteomic and metabolomic (multi-omic) sciences to: discover, test, and cross-validate multi-omic signatures of cardiac function and structure in patients with severe AS (Aim 1); characterize longitudinal multi-omic signatures and associations with changes in cardiac structure and function after AVR (Aim 2); and evaluate the accuracy with which multi-omic signatures predict response to AVR (Aim 3). Our approach will enable us to identify multi-omic signatures of irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury in patients with severe AS. These data will support the development of new precision medicine-based strategies for identifying patients who would benefit from earlier clinical intervention in an effort to reduce mortality and maximize health after AVR. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aortic stenosis ultimately leads to heart failure and death, but valve replacement is curative. For many patients, valve replacement is performed too late, after damage to the heart muscle is no longer reversible, resulting in persistent symptoms and increased risk for death. The goal of my research is to identify compounds within the blood that can serve as an early warning that the heart is struggling to overcome aortic stenosis and can therefore help physicians plan the optimal timing of valve replacement surgery.",Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart,9946858,R01HL151838,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'EFRAC', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heart', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'aortic valve replacement', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'patient registry', 'persistent symptom', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive signature', 'pressure', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,696226,0.12505308862014763
"Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction to the exposure to severe psychological stress, including trauma re-experiencing, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. Our group has conducted seminal work to establish PTSD as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and autonomic dysfunction. A major concern, based on these findings, is that PTSD could increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) through autonomic dysregulation. This has important clinical implications on management of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. Two important metrics that are potentially useful for risk stratification are T-wave alternans (TWA) and Morphological Beat Variability (MVB). We have found in preliminary investigations that TWA may be linked to acute stress and PTSD, but additional study is needed. In this R03 application, we seek to collaborate with Dr. Gari Clifford in Biomedical Informatics to create a custom program that measures TWA and MVB with state-of- the-art signal processing in a recently recruited cohort of male veteran twins with high-resolution ECG data. We will also study for genetic influences with twin modeling and the effects of acute stress with laboratory- based trauma reminder challenges. Our aims are to 1) Examine the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA a) over 24 hours, and b) during trauma recall challenge; 2) Evaluate the potential role for familial and genetic factors by comparing the within-pair difference in MVB and TWA between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD. We hypothesize that MVB and TWA will be higher, on average, during a 24 hour period, and will increase during trauma recall challenge in PTSD subjects compared to those without PTSD. In addition, we hypothesize that the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA will be stronger within DZ pairs than MZ pairs, implying that there is a common genetic pathway linking PTSD and SCD risk. The development of methods to measure these factors, as well as the study of these important mechanisms, will accelerate Dr. Shah’s progress towards research independence, and help to establish him as an expert in the field of mental stress and SCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Posttraumatic stress disorder is a common and debilitating psychiatric condition that is associated with increased heart disease risk. Whether or not this means that it increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia is not known, but important for clinical management. To study this, we aim to examine the risk of PTSD and its symptoms on electrocardiographic markers of sudden cardiac death.",Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study,9915968,R03HL146879,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Arrhythmia', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional Stress', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Veterans', 'Viola', 'Visit', 'War', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'heart disease risk', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'method development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'programs', 'recruit', 'signal processing', 'sudden cardiac death', 'traumatic event', 'traumatic stress', 'vector']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,78000,0.02052571222934564
"Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Abnormalities in heart rate, cardiac conduction (PR and QRS) and repolarization (QT) measured on the ECG predispose to the clinically important cardiac arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) / sudden cardiac death (SCD). We examine the genomic basis of these ECG endophenotypes in order to deconstruct arrhythmias into more proximate traits and discrete components, allowing us to better understand underlying mechanisms, provide insight into arrhythmia generation, and help target development of novel therapies.  The molecular architecture of cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias is not fully understood, but likely involves genomic, epigenomic, and environmental influences. Over the past 10 years, we have identified numerous common loci associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias, yet these common variants account for only a portion of the heritability of electrophysiologic and arrhythmic phenotypes. The agnostic examination of genotype-phenotype associations employed in genome- wide association studies (GWAS) does not incorporate knowledge of functional genomic regions or important biologic relationships. Additionally, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms connecting mostly intergenic and intronic GWAS signals to phenotype. We therefore hypothesize that a systems biology approach integrating genetic sequence variation with omic data (epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data) will uncover novel associations and elucidate biologic mechanisms associated with arrhythmia-related phenotypes. We further hypothesize that examining the simultaneous association between sequence variation and multiple cardiac electrophysiologic phenotypes will help uncover additional novel mechanisms associated with cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias.  TOPMed's combination of rich phenotype data, with whole genome sequence (WGS), epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, provides a unique opportunity to more comprehensively explore these hypotheses. We leverage sequence, omic, and phenotype data from multiple cohort studies to efficiently and cost-effectively examine and dissect association of omic factors with cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia risk. Our application is an ambitious yet eminently feasible effort that integrates clinical, genetic, and systems biology expertise. We aim to discover associations using omics data (Aims 1 and 2) and elucidate specific genes and biologic pathways underlying these associations (Aims 3 and 4). Our ultimate goal is to identify pathways, genes, and genetic variation that are clinically relevant, and therefore potentially the target of new therapies, diagnostics, or risk predictions. Narrative Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This proposal aims to use genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, combined with complex systems biology and pleiotropic analyses, to better understand the underlying pathways and genes involved in normal electrophysiology and arrhythmia formation. The identification of biologic factors that influence cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmias will provide insight into the mechanisms of arrhythmia generation, and perhaps identify better targets for drug development and prevention.",Systems Biology Analysis of Cardiac Electrical Activity and Arrhythmias.,9921462,R01HL141989,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Regulator Genes', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'heart electrical activity', 'insight', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'pleiotropism', 'rare variant', 'sudden cardiac death', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,476969,0.0450428778790332
"A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement Abstract In the United States alone, more than three million peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are placed each year to provide IV therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Improper PICC placement is relatively common, is costly, and has serious complications for critically-ill patients. Unfortunately, under blind placement 30-55% of PICC tips are not optimally placed on the first attempt and require repositioning, which has an average direct cost of $223 per patient and often necessitates the removal and reinsertion of the catheter line that carries a 4-6% risk of pneumothorax. Moreover, approximately 17% of these improperly positioned PICCs are placed into the right atrium, which is associated with a multitude of life-threatening complications. Improper placement of PICCs also often requires referral to an interventional radiologist for fluoroscopic-guided central line placement, which is expensive ($1,000) and requires more radiation exposure for the patient. Not surprisingly, over half of all PICCs are administered to patients over the age of 60. Therefore, safe and accurate PICC placement is critical for providing high-quality care to older Americans. Despite serious adverse events associated with blind placement of PICC lines, current vascular access systems have not been widely adopted. The Teleflex ARROW® G4 VPS and the Bard Sherlock 3CG® TCS are PICC guidance systems that employ ECG for positioning the PICC tip into the correct location: the region that includes the lower superior vena cava (SVC) and cavoatrial junction (CAJ). While these procedures often limit the need for a confirmatory X-ray, they have poor and variable successful placement rates (44-84%), are 30-70% more expensive than standard PICCs, require skilled staff, and have significantly longer procedure times as compared to standard, blind PICC placement. Additionally, these guidance systems rely on the use of ECG, which is ineffective for patients with cardiac arrhythmias, a condition that affects approximately 16% of all patients requiring a PICC line. To address the need for accurate, safe, and cost- effective PICC placement, Piccolo Medical has developed the Smart PICC™ system, a point-of-care catheter system that uses unique hemodynamic signatures of different vascular regions for real-time vascular access guidance into the SVC/CAJ. The goals of this Phase II proposal are to validate the accuracy of the Piccolo Smart PICC™ for navigation and placement of a PICC tip into the SVC or CAJ for adult patients with and without cardiac arrhythmias. First, we will verify the sensitivity of the Smart PICC™ system algorithm to identify correct PICC placement in adult patients with both normal and altered cardiac rhythms (Aim 1). Second, we will compare the accuracy of the Smart PICC™ system to the most widely used catheter navigation system (BD’s Sherlock 3CG® TCS) in a head-to-head superiority study (Aim 2).The data obtained will support FDA 510(k) clearance and will allow us to commercialize the system within ~2.5 years of the funding of this proposal. Narrative Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are widely used to provide life-sustaining intravenous therapies, where navigation through the venous system is typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Commercially available PICC navigation systems can be effective, but have limitations that have impeded adoption into the clinic. We propose an inexpensive, easily operated catheter system for real-time vascular access guidance that addresses the limitations of current systems.","A Novel, Low-Cost Device to Guide Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) Line Placement",10019319,R44AG060793,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Arrhythmia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Distal', 'EKG P Wave', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Valves', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Multi-site clinical study', 'Myocardial', 'Navigation System', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation exposure', 'Randomized', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Right atrial structure', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Savings', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superior vena cava structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thermodilution', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Venous system', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'radiologist', 'sensor']",NIA,"PICCOLO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2020,561565,0.01786597812336713
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants.
