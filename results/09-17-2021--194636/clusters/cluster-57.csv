"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9784818,R03EB027268,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Electronics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'neural network architecture', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'photomultiplier', 'physical process', 'response', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'time use', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2019,78500,0.19687975250365594
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9789276,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,586260,0.14376817662641908
"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. This project will develop an innovative image reconstruction method that has potential to improve PET image quality and reduce radiation dose. Its success will improve the accuracy of PET for cancer detection and other diseases.",Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography,9752639,R21EB026668,"['Advanced Development', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Rattus', 'Role', 'Solid', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'animal data', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2019,196250,0.20804647562184161
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9653979,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,663746,0.22890719660619963
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging Abstract The overall goal of this research is to develop next generation positron emission tomography (PET) detector technology to support non-invasive, quantitative brain imaging at spatial and temporal resolutions currently not achievable with human neuro-PET systems. The developed PET detector technology will also be compatible with operation in an MRI system. The proposed research is targeted to the NIH Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative. Human brain imaging with PET/MRI will be an essential tool in neuroscience studies to ""Develop innovative technologies to understand the human brain and treat its disorders; create and support integrated brain research networks."" The key advancement that we introduce is a PET detector with <100 psec time-of-flight (TOF) PET coincidence resolution, <2 mm continuous depth of interaction (DOI) positioning and intrinsic detector spatial resolution to support <1 mm PET image resolution throughout the system imaging field of view (FOV). Detector modules have been designed that individually achieve these performance metrics; however, no detector module has been designed that supports all of them. To make disruptive advancements in neuro-imaging using PET, one must push the image spatial resolution (i.e., currently 2-3 mm image resolution) as well as coincidence timing resolution and also be MRI compatible. The impact of this project is that we will advance the state of the art in all of these critical performance areas. We will achieve these goals by first understanding the role that different PET detector performance parameters have on task-based figures of merit for neuroPET imaging. We will investigate how both TOF and image resolution impact figure of merit performance for estimation, detection and characterization imaging tasks. Monte Carlo simulation will be used along with both object-based (i.e., mathematical) and anthropomorphic digital phantoms. Next we will optimize SiPM device selection, electronics and detector geometry for <100 psec TOF coincidence timing, 1 mm intrinsic spatial resolution and <2 mm DOI positioning resolution. We will build and characterize a prototype PET detector module utilizing a novel dual- sided slat crystal detector design. To advance coincidence timing performance we will investigate the use of machine learning to estimate the arrival time of detected events. Finally, we will optimize the detector design for MRI compatibility. We will fully test and characterize performance of our prototype detector on the benchtop and in a MRI scanner while running clinical MRI pulse sequences. At the end of this developmental project we will be in position to build a state of the art, MRI compatible, TOF, DOI PET imaging system. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop detector imaging technology that will enable new research into the development, function and aging of the human brain. This technology will allow functional imaging of the brain at higher spatial resolution and higher coincidence timing resolution than previously achieved and also facilitate simultaneous multi-modality imaging (i.e., PET/MRI) at these new levels of performance.","A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging",9791188,R01EB026964,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging detector', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'operation', 'prototype', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,22992,0.21099786555932767
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,9802309,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response', 'retinal rods']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2019,293568,0.20366012554960342
"Automatic SUV Extraction and Biodistribution Analysis of Preclinical PET Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) plays a significant role in monitoring radiotracer biodistributions for the development of new therapies. The standardized uptake value (SUV) has become one of the most important quantitation measures in PET analysis. However, SUV extraction from PET data hinges on the ability to clearly delineate the organ region-of-interest (ROI) from an anatomical reference. Cross-comparison of different organ SUVs and biodistributions is also cumbersome due to complex registration strategies of each animal with an unknown pose and size. Operator bias and lack of efficient co-registration strategies results in poor data reproducibility, high data variability, low data throughput and prohibits the use of fully-automated data parsing and data analysis for predicting early therapy outcomes with high sensitivity. In Vivo Analytics will directly address these shortcomings by developing InVivoPET. It will be a cloud-based PET data analysis tool, which will enable automatic organ SUV extraction followed by an instantaneous biodistribution analysis. InVivoPET will automatically coregister PET images to the animal’s anatomy and will calculate biodistributions in almost real-time. InVivoPET consists of several parts. First, a Body Conforming Animal Mold (BCAM) enables consistent spatial and longitudinal registration of the animal’s pose and location to the PET data. Second, a statistical mouse atlas based on an Organ Probability Map (OPM) provides a digital and operator-independent organ ROI template. Third, a cloud-based software with a browser-based user interface enables an automatic organ SUV extraction with following biodistribution analysis. Last, machine learning and data mining algorithms can be applied in the future that will further enhance study outcomes. InVivoPET does not rely on manual delineation of organs. A machine-driven data analysis fully eliminates operator-dependent variability and increases data reproducibility. It will enable the drug development team to quantitate the impact of candidate therapeutics with the highest accuracy, reduces the time to enter clinical trials, reduces costs, and ensures the quantification and consistency of PET data. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the organ SUV can automatically be extracted from PET data using the BCAM and OPM. In Aim 1, we will modify the BCAM for housing mice with surface-protruding tumors and confirm the ability for spatially aligning mice with tumor xenografts to the OPM. In Aim 2, we will perform PET imaging of tumor bearing mice using 18F-FDG and confirm the ability for automatically extracting the organ SUV based on the OPM. The successful completion of the proposed project will help to commercialize InVivoPET, which will be sold as a plug-in to existing PET systems and as a PET- manufacturer independent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9755492,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'automated analysis', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,756169,0.24539283697626374
"Dose Reduction in Pediatric/Adolescent Brain PET Imaging Through Artificial Neural Networks Project Summary/Abstract  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of complex neurodevelopment disorders affecting nearly 1.5 percent of American children. The underlying and contributing mechanisms of ASD are largely undetermined and there are no FDA-approved medications to treat the core social-communicative symptoms of the disorder. Unlike other brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there is a gross disparity between the high prevalence of ASD and the small number of PET research studies; this condition should be addressed since the opportunities for PET imaging to have an impact in ASD research are substantial.  Synapses allow for the transmission of electrochemical information, which is the essential means of communication in the brain. Synaptic pathology has been associated with brain disorders including AD, epilepsy, autism, depression, and schizophrenia. Our recent development of 11C-UCB-J, a PET radioligand that binds to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), provides the ability to quantify synaptic density in the living human brain. 11C-UCB-J for SV2A PET imaging has the potential to make game-changing contributions to ASD research and potential diagnosis. However, because of the current imaging dose, the technique cannot be applied regularly in autism research of children due to the requirement of low radiation exposure especially for longitudinal studies in the same individuals at different developmental stages.  The goal of this proposal is to reduce the clinical 11C-UCB-J PET imaging dose to be lower than the radiation one receives from a round-trip cross-country flight. To accomplish this goal, we will develop artificial neural network-based dose-reduction techniques. We hypothesize that 1) the proposed techniques will enhance (parametric) images from 1/10 of the dose so that they are comparable to the full-dose (parametric) images in terms of noise and resolution and 2) with the reduced dose, the test-retest reproducibility and the ability to differentiate patients from controls will not be diminished.  The proposed research will be the first study to demonstrate that PET imaging dose can be reduced to a point of acceptability for ASD research in children and other diseases of adolescence. This effort is in line with the NIBIB I/START program to develop clinical technologies for imaging development in children and synergizes with the NIH supported large scale ABCD (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development) longitudinal study for brain development in children, where MRI has been widely used but PET has not. If successful, we will apply for a larger grant to use SV2A PET to characterize the mechanisms of ASD neuropathology toward more effective diagnosis and personalized treatment. Project Narrative A newly developed positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracer can be used to measure synaptic density in the living human brain. Synaptic pathology has been associated with many brain disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which affects 1.5% of American children. The project will use machine learning techniques to explore whether the radiation dose of synaptic PET imaging can be effectively lowered to roughly that of a round-trip cross-country airline flight for its regular utilization in ASD research in children and adolescents.",Dose Reduction in Pediatric/Adolescent Brain PET Imaging Through Artificial Neural Networks,9727470,R03EB028070,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seizures', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'attenuation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory process', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiation effect', 'radioligand', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'social', 'success', 'task analysis', 'transmission process', 'uptake']",NIBIB,OAKLAND UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,228409,0.028355184568540134
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9817807,R01AR074492,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait retraining', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,561592,0.14214390954203693
"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer.

"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9651713,R03EB027268,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Dose', 'Electronics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'photomultiplier', 'physical process', 'response', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'time use', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2018,78500,0.19687975250365594
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9599417,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,653337,0.14376817662641908
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9524253,R01CA218187,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,684119,0.22890719660619963
"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. This project will develop an innovative image reconstruction method that has potential to improve PET image quality and reduce radiation dose.

"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging Abstract The overall goal of this research is to develop next generation positron emission tomography (PET) detector technology to support non-invasive, quantitative brain imaging at spatial and temporal resolutions currently not achievable with human neuro-PET systems. The developed PET detector technology will also be compatible with operation in an MRI system. The proposed research is targeted to the NIH Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative. Human brain imaging with PET/MRI will be an essential tool in neuroscience studies to ""Develop innovative technologies to understand the human brain and treat its disorders; create and support integrated brain research networks."" The key advancement that we introduce is a PET detector with <100 psec time-of-flight (TOF) PET coincidence resolution, <2 mm continuous depth of interaction (DOI) positioning and intrinsic detector spatial resolution to support <1 mm PET image resolution throughout the system imaging field of view (FOV). Detector modules have been designed that individually achieve these performance metrics; however, no detector module has been designed that supports all of them. To make disruptive advancements in neuro-imaging using PET, one must push the image spatial resolution (i.e., currently 2-3 mm image resolution) as well as coincidence timing resolution and also be MRI compatible. The impact of this project is that we will advance the state of the art in all of these critical performance areas. We will achieve these goals by first understanding the role that different PET detector performance parameters have on task-based figures of merit for neuroPET imaging. We will investigate how both TOF and image resolution impact figure of merit performance for estimation, detection and characterization imaging tasks. Monte Carlo simulation will be used along with both object-based (i.e., mathematical) and anthropomorphic digital phantoms. Next we will optimize SiPM device selection, electronics and detector geometry for <100 psec TOF coincidence timing, 1 mm intrinsic spatial resolution and <2 mm DOI positioning resolution. We will build and characterize a prototype PET detector module utilizing a novel dual- sided slat crystal detector design. To advance coincidence timing performance we will investigate the use of machine learning to estimate the arrival time of detected events. Finally, we will optimize the detector design for MRI compatibility. We will fully test and characterize performance of our prototype detector on the benchtop and in a MRI scanner while running clinical MRI pulse sequences. At the end of this developmental project we will be in position to build a state of the art, MRI compatible, TOF, DOI PET imaging system. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop detector imaging technology that will enable new research into the development, function and aging of the human brain. This technology will allow functional imaging of the brain at higher spatial resolution and higher coincidence timing resolution than previously achieved and also facilitate simultaneous multi-modality imaging (i.e., PET/MRI) at these new levels of performance.","A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging",9616697,R01EB026964,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging detector', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'operation', 'prototype', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,29442,0.21099786555932767
"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Supplement Title: Deep learning-based methods for PET image reconstruction and segmentation to enhance radionuclide therapy dosimetry Abstract There is much recent interest in quantitative imaging of yttrium-90 (Y-90) for dosimetry because of the promise of novel Y-90 labelled radionuclide therapies. Deep learning methods are well suited for addressing the challenges of Y-90 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, where compared with diagnostic FDG PET, true coincidence count-rates are very low while random coincidences are high. The potential of deep learning-based algorithms to outperform conventional algorithms in medical imaging is well recognized, however research in applying these methods to nuclear medicine imaging modalities such as PET is very limited. The few studies applying deep learning to PET imaging have been mostly limited to post-reconstruction image processing/analysis for denoising and feature extraction, and not in the image formation/reconstruction process. Additionally, deep learning research in PET thus far have focused on improving diagnostic imaging, not quantitative imaging, which together with accurate lesion/organ segmentation are pre-requisite for accurate dosimetry. In this supplement, we propose to develop and evaluate deep learning-based image reconstruction and lesion/organ segmentation for low count PET applications such as Y-90 PET. Our approach starts with the raw projection data and utilizes a deep recurrent network in the image formation process. Because the two tasks are mutually dependent, our formalism takes the novel approach of joint reconstruction-segmentation with multi-modality (PET/CT) data. Specifically, we will 1) develop and evaluate Y-90 PET image reconstruction with a deep recurrent network for the regularizer, 2) develop and evaluate deep-learning based joint PET segmentation-reconstruction using multi- modal 90Y PET/CT data. To train/validate/test the proposed methods, we will use clinically realistic phantom measurements and simulations as well as leverage on existing patient data from the parent grant where thus far, PET data and radiologist defined morphologic liver/lesion contours for over 50 cases and 150 lesions are available. We will compare the new Y-90 PET reconstruction with the formulation we recently developed under the parent grant (using conventional untrained regularizers) that showed promising results but suffered from resolution- noise tradeoff. The expected outcome of this work is a well validated deep learning reconstruction- segmentation framework for challenging PET imaging applications where conventional methods are suboptimal. The proposed research is expected to result in new and accurate tools for quantitative image reconstruction and lesion/organ segmentation that have the potential to contribute significantly toward improving dosimetry in internal radionuclide therapy such as Yttrium- 90 radioembolization in liver malignancies. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided personalized approach to radionuclide therapy is highly likely to substantially improve patient outcomes compared to current standard practice. !",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,9750430,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Formulation', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'dosimetry', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parent grant', 'personalized approach', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,102093,0.21017714871771548
"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9539728,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,756791,0.24539283697626374
"New Approach to Quantitative Beta Amyloid Imaging Using PET Summary This project seeks to prove the commercial feasibility of a new approach to analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data that would improve sensitivity, quantitative accuracy, and accessibility of imaging the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent progress in understanding the nature of neurodegenerative diseases — especially evidence that the onset of cognitive symptoms of AD can be mitigated —amplify the critical need of improved quantitative evaluation of AD biomarkers. Dynamic PET may be the most accurate modality capable of achieving this goal. However, current strategies of analyzing dynamic PET images either require complex acquisition protocols with invasive arterial blood sampling procedures or rely on accuracy-degrading approximations such as compartment modeling. We have developed Intelligent Dynamics-Driven Quantitative Diagnostics (IDDQD), a novel processing approach based on factor analysis of dynamic structures with partial clustering used to initiate the process. We have shown that an early version of IDDQD can extract blood and tissue tracer dynamics and the corresponding spatial distributions from 11C-PIB PET scans. SolvingDynamics Inc plans to offer a Research-as-a-Service data processing workflow that will apply IDDQD to dynamic brain PET datasets acquired by the customers, producing accurate quantitative tracer dynamics time-activity curves (TACs) and the distribution of the targeted tissues, including the AD biomarkers beta-amyloid and tau. Our proprietary algorithm does not require the tracer dynamics model to achieve steady state, so a shorter scan can be used to generate results of similar or better accuracy than those produced by current approaches, such as reference tissue- based methods. In this proposal, SolvingDynamics seeks to prove the feasibility of our proposed approach by comparing the diagnostics obtained using IDDQD analysis of dynamic PET data and those obtained from independent measurements. A subcontract group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been conducting dynamic 11C-PIB PET studies for several years and has accumulated over 70 cases with PET data matched to both cognitive-memory tests and to post-mortem pathology studies. SolvingDynamics will retrospectively apply its analysis technique to these datasets and compare its computed tissue distributions to standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) data. A subset of 20 dynamic 11C-PIB PET datasets ranging in length from 15 to 90 minutes will also be analyzed in order to validate the feasibility of reducing the imaging time. In addition, similar studies aimed at reducing imaging time with IDDQD will be performed for 20 PET scans acquired using 18F-AV1451 tracer to image tau. PROJECT NARRATIVE Positron emission tomography image analysis methodology to be validated in this project aims to improve sensitivity and specificity of tissue analysis in dynamic positron emission tomography, improving diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders.

"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images.

"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation.

"Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a gold standard method for detecting viable myocardium to select which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to benefit most from surgical revascularization. Its use in clinic, however, is under-utilized because of the limited clinical availability of the radiotracers needed. This research aims to develop a novel PET imaging method for assessment of myocardial viability that can be easily accessed in clinic with reduced lower radiation dose and imaging cost without compromising imaging performance.",Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET,9251317,R21HL131385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ammonia', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cyclotrons', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rubidium', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tracer', 'United States', 'Visit', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose transport', 'heart function', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'public health relevance', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2017,195625,0.2620050516665412
"Area B:  Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to Measure Tumor Glutamine and Glucose Metabolic Rates in a Single Imaging Session Precision oncology places an increased demand on cancer diagnostics to characterize tumors at the time of diagnosis. Tissue diagnostics for precision oncology increasingly rely on multi-valent assays to characterize cancer biology and identify therapeutic targets. The power of molecular imaging for cancer diagnosis has been well demonstrated by [18F]fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT), widely used in clinical oncology. PET tracers targeted to facets of tumor biology now enable multi-valent molecular imaging to identify therapeutic targets. Early studies show that combined tracer studies, commonly FDG plus a target- specific tracer, are highly predictive of tumor response to targeted therapy. However, emissions from different PET tracers are indistinguishable to a PET scanner, requiring separate imaging sessions on separate days for multiple 18F-based tracers (~ 2 hour half-life) in the same patient. This limits the clinical practicality of multi-tracer PET, and fails to exploit the full power of multi-tracer PET to quantify tumor in vivo biology and biologic heterogeneity for highly variable process such as cancer metabolism. We will overcome this limitation by taking advantage of recent developments in volumetric PET scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis methods from our laboratories to develop Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate multi-valent, quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session to guide precision oncology and translational cancer biology research. As such, our proposed technology development project addresses a need, described under Priority Area B for “new capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer patients”. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we now propose to integrate and enhance these methodologies to develop and validate Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session. We will develop and test this approach for simultaneous glucose and glutamine metabolism imaging, with the goal of guiding metabolism-targeted therapy such as inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The project will focus on the technology developments (largely computational) that enable multi-tracer imaging. Ongoing and separately funded work on clinical studies will acquire data from two separate imaging PET sessions using current technology and will provide data for method development. We will first optimize tracer dose timing, image reconstruction, and image time binning for dual tracer MTV-PET (Aim 1), followed by implementation and technical validation of image analysis using a mixture analysis approach (Aim 2). This will set the stage for technical validation of MTV-PET (Aim 3) and an exploratory aim (Aim 4) testing image analytics based on machine learning. Successful completion of our technology development will yield a new method for multi-tracer PET that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarker and precision oncology research, consistent with goals of RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B.

"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9382827,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,771431,0.24539283697626374
"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.

"Motion Compensated Brain PET Imaging for Neuroscience Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced imaging technologies such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) have led to remarkable improvement in our knowledge of brain metabolism, function, and biochemistry. And yet, our understanding of most neurological disorders is at best rudimentary. Etiology of such common diseases as drug and alcohol addiction, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's remains elusive. Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma continue being fatal. Changes happening in the brain in such common syndromes as hospital-acquired delirium, and post-operative cognitive decline, are not understood. Most studies involving advanced brain imaging remain small due to logistical challenges, cost constraints, and difficulty of scanning neurological patients in standard radiology equipment. Acceleration of brain research is required to elucidate the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Brain Biosciences was established to make neurological imaging comfortable, inexpensive, and widely available both in the clinic and in the research laboratory. One of the common problems encountered in imaging research is unintentional patient motion. Head movement during Positron Emission Tomography (PET) degrades PET image quality, leads to image artifacts, and introduces quantitative errors. Motion is particularly common in confused patients with neurological diseases, drug addiction, and movement disorders. This problem becomes especially relevant as research involving lengthy dynamic scans, and high-resolution brain imaging becomes common. While sedation is often used to minimize the patient motion, sedative drugs change brain biochemistry, interfere with radiopharmaceutical uptake, and may cause side effects. Physical restraints are often distressing, and may increase patient agitation. In this direct Phase II SBIR proposal we seek to develop, clinically validate, and receive FDA clearance for FREEMotion(tm), a video-based head tracking system, enabling motion- compensated brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of neurological patients without sedation or physical head restraint.

"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered.

"Motion Compensated Brain PET Imaging for Neuroscience Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced imaging technologies such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) have led to remarkable improvement in our knowledge of brain metabolism, function, and biochemistry. And yet, our understanding of most neurological disorders is at best rudimentary. Etiology of such common diseases as drug and alcohol addiction, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's remains elusive. Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma continue being fatal. Changes happening in the brain in such common syndromes as hospital-acquired delirium, and post-operative cognitive decline, are not understood. Most studies involving advanced brain imaging remain small due to logistical challenges, cost constraints, and difficulty of scanning neurological patients in standard radiology equipment. Acceleration of brain research is required to elucidate the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Brain Biosciences was established to make neurological imaging comfortable, inexpensive, and widely available both in the clinic and in the research laboratory. One of the common problems encountered in imaging research is unintentional patient motion. Head movement during Positron Emission Tomography (PET) degrades PET image quality, leads to image artifacts, and introduces quantitative errors. Motion is particularly common in confused patients with neurological diseases, drug addiction, and movement disorders. This problem becomes especially relevant as research involving lengthy dynamic scans, and high-resolution brain imaging becomes common. While sedation is often used to minimize the patient motion, sedative drugs change brain biochemistry, interfere with radiopharmaceutical uptake, and may cause side effects. Physical restraints are often distressing, and may increase patient agitation. In this direct Phase II SBIR proposal we seek to develop, clinically validate, and receive FDA clearance for FREEMotion(tm), a video-based head tracking system, enabling motion- compensated brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of neurological patients without sedation or physical head restraint.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to develop and validate a novel head tracking system capable of compensating for patient motion during high-resolution brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers.

"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. During the current funding period, we have developed a method for tuning reconstruction algorithm based on the noise characteristics in measured patient data. This patient-adaptive reconstruction algorithm has been validated using computer simulations and phantom experiments. In the next phase of the project, we will implement the patient-adaptive algorithm on clinical PET scanners and validate the method using patient data. We will further expand the capability of PET imaging by developing novel methods to utilize the anatomical information provided by PET/CT scanners and by exploring the potential of dynamic PET for cancer detection and staging. The four specific aims of the project are (1) To implement the patient-adaptive MAP reconstruction on clinical scanners and to validate the algorithm using breast cancer patients; (2) To develop a novel approach to PET image reconstruction using anatomical information; (3) To develop statistically efficient image reconstruction methods for dynamic PET; (4) To identify spatial-temporal features in dynamic PET image for detection and characterization of breast cancer and to evaluate the performance using breast cancer patient data. The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors. All the results will be validated using breast cancer patient data with histologically verified ground truth. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the management of patients with breast cancer.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor.

The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors.

"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes.

"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress.

"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9853761,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'PSA level', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,671823,0.22890719660619963
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning.

"Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning Project Summary Positron-emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that allows clinicians and researchers to study the physiological or pathological processes of the human body, and in particular the brain via the use of specific tracers. For brain PET imaging, patient head movement during scanning presents a challenge for accurate PET image reconstruction and subsequent quantitative analysis. Problems due to head motion are exacerbated by the long duration of the scans, with scan times commonly over one hour. Furthermore, some PET studies specifically involve subjects that either have trouble staying still due to psychological variations, e.g. patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, or psychological variations, e.g. subjects with anxiety disorders, or are required to participate in tasks that involve movement, e.g. smoking cigarettes while scanning. In brain scans, the average head motion can vary from 7 mm in clinical scans to triple this amount for longer research scans. Quantitatively, a 5 mm head motion can produce biases of up to ~35% in regional intensities and ∼15% in volume of distribution estimates, which could much larger than the difference observed in regional intensities or binding potential that distinguish different demographic groups being studied. The ability to track and correct head motion, therefore, would be of high utility in both clinical and research PET studies. In the past, many motion correction methods have been proposed. However, except for hardware-based approaches, there has been no method that can track frequent head motion on-the-fly during the PET acquisition. Hardware-based approaches are not readily available for clinical translation or used by other research facilities due to highly-customized software/hardware setup. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a data-driven methodology using deep learning to track and estimate rigid head motion using PET raw data, and incorporate both tracer type and time as conditional variables into this deep neural network design in order to handle diverse PET tracer types and their dynamic behavior. Overall, these solutions will provide for a data-driven motion estimation methodology to improve the quality of PET imaging. Specifically, we will start with the development and testing of our methodology for rigid head motion estimation using single-tracer PET raw data. Then we will perform evaluation of our multi-tracer motion estimation methodology applied to real PET data with a diverse range of tracers. Finally, in the exploratory phase, we will integrate time-of-flight information into deep learning-based motion prediction. The significance of this proposal is that it will allow for improved quality of PET imaging in real time and potentially allow for its use in clinical PET systems that do not have special motion tracking hardware. This work will serve as a first step towards developing data-driven motion estimation algorithms for full body PET imaging. The innovation lies in the development of what is a data-driven solution to the problem of real time motion estimation. Project Narrative Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain is a highly useful tool for biomedical research and clinical practice. Head motion during scanning degrades PET image quality and introduces image artifacts. We propose to develop new data-driven methods, based on PET raw data, to estimate head motion using deep learning, which can be used for real time motion estimation in PET imaging.",Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning,9877261,R21EB028954,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neural network', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'research facility', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,243150,0.24762317511804563
"Development of a prototype software for automated PET/CT interpretation and reporting in thoracic cancer Abstract. In cancer, body-wide FDG-PET/CT is a prime modality for diagnosis, staging, and treatment assessment. Despite its paramount importance to enable precision medicine in cancer, no method is currently available for automated disease burden estimation and standardized reporting on PET/CT images regionally and globally in anatomic organs and lymph node zones within a body region or body-wide. Automated production- mode body-wide/ body-region-wide disease measurement with standardized reporting will foster cancer research discovery and will be of great interest to oncologists, radiologists/ nuclear medicine physicians, Medicare and private health insurers, and pharmaceutical companies that conduct clinical trials of new cancer therapeutics and currently rely on manual methods of response assessment. The overarching goal of this Phase I project is, therefore, to develop, validate, and demonstrate a prototype software for disease measurement and reporting via FDG-PET/CT in the above manner in one body region, namely thorax, based on innovative algorithms that are generalizable body-wide. The project has two aims: Aim 1: Develop, implement, and validate algorithms for disease burden estimation in thoracic cancer via FDG-PET/CT. Aim 2: Develop and demonstrate a prototype software implementing the above algorithms for disease measurement and reporting. Aim 1 will be accomplished in 3 stages: Tasks 1, 2: PET/CT image data sets which are radiologically near normal for the thoracic body region will be gathered from existing whole-body scans of 100 patients. In these data sets, 7 key anatomic organs and 5 key lymph node zones in the thorax will be delineated under expert guidance. These data will be used to build population fuzzy anatomy models following our established Automatic Anatomy Recognition (AAR) methodology. An additional 100 whole-body PET/CT scans of patients with different types of cancer will be gathered to test our methods. Using available commercial clinical software, the PET uptake properties of lesions in organs and diseased lymph nodes in lymph node zones will be measured manually and used as reference ground truth of disease burden. Task 3: Deep learning (DL) algorithms anatomically guided by AAR will be developed to very accurately localize (but not delineate) organs and lymph node zones in PET/CT images using the models. Task 4: Novel methods based on fuzzy principles will be developed to automatically tag and quantify pathological regions (without explicitly delineating them) within located organs and nodal zones, and the accuracy of disease measurement will be evaluated (Task 5). Aim 2 will be accomplished by incorporating the disease measurement methodology into a prototype software named AAR-DQ (Tasks 6, 7) based on our earlier software platform CAVASS. AAR-DQ will report disease burden in a hierarchical manner – (i) at the body-region level; (ii) at each organ/ lymph node zone level; (ii) at each lesion/ lymph node level. Expected milestones.

"Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods Project Summary / Abstract  Hybrid PET/MRI systems are very advantageous for a variety of clinical applications by combining the soft tissue contrast of MRI with the functional and metabolic information of PET. These systems have found success for oncology studies, particularly in head and abdomen/pelvis, as well as for epilepsy, neurological diseases, heart disease, and pediatrics for dose reduction. However, the PET resolution and SNR is typically worse than MRI, and suffers from the loss of feature and data due to motion as well. PET/MRI systems offer the potential to create more accurate, higher resolution PET reconstructions, including correction of artifacts, motion, and im- proved localization, by performing synergistic reconstructions that leverage the simultaneous data acquisition. In particular, this fellowship proposes to develop novel physics-constrained machine learning models for informa- tion sharing between PET and MRI for enhanced spatial localization, estimation of attenuation and activity, and motion. We propose to develop a deep maximum-likelihood estimation of attenuation and activity (MLAA) that can compensate for artifacts and improve PET reconstruction accuracy. We also propose a motion-enhanced joint PET/MRI reconstruction to capture arbitrary motions and reduce dose requirements for chest and abdomen studies. Together, these models aim to improve the PET spatio-temporal resolution, SNR, and quantiﬁcation for a broad range of clinical applications, and will be evaluated for cancer assessment in the pelvis, liver, and lung.  This fellowship will be performed in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at UCSF under the guidance of Prof. Peder Larson, who leads a research program on advanced imaging methods development, and Dr. Thomas Hope, a radiologist and nuclear medicine physician who leads multiple PET/MRI projects. The Department is one of the leading centers in biomedical imaging research, and has been at the forefront on translating PET/MRI systems into clinical practice. The UCSF PET/MRI scanner has dedicated research time, which is also available on other MRI and PET/CT research systems, and extensive computational resources to support the proposed project. The applicant, Dr. Abhejit Rajagopal, has a background in computational imaging and machine learning, will be jointly mentored by this engineer/physician team. He will be trained to become a biomedical imaging scientist by participating in formal coursework on medical imaging systems, training on the PET/MRI system, grant writing, and performing clinical research, supporting his development into a creative, independent biomedical researcher. Project Narrative  Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) imaging systems cur- rently aid in diagnosis and prognosis of numerous types of cancer and disease, but are not always precise enough to accurately measure and track a patient’s response to therapy, particularly in organs and tissue that are sub- ject to motion. There is an unrealized potential here to synergistically combine complimentary PET-MRI data to dramatically improve the spatial resolution and SNR of PET, as well as to create motion-resolved 4D (x,y,z,t) imagery by combining information across modalities and time-frames to combat severe undersampling. These methods will be evaluated in human studies of cancer to capture ﬁne structure and micro-features on moving organs (e.g. lung nodules, liver metastases), ultimately aiding in quantitative characterization of disease.",Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods,10069132,F32EB030411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Chest', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Fellowship', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Oncology', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Writing', 'attenuation', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'combat', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'information model', 'lung imaging', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'systems research', 'uptake']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69426,0.2439986854007377
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,10017238,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rod', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2020,243919,0.20366012554960342
"Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabeled tracer 2- deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard imaging tool for cancer patient management. The semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) is routinely used in clinical for tumor uptake quantification, which is computed on the static PET image acquired at a certain time (typically 60 min) post tracer injection for a short interval (typically 5-15 min). However, the quantification accuracy of SUV from a single PET scan suffers from the variabilities of tracer plasma clearance and acquisition start time. The dual- time-point FDG PET imaging has been intensively investigated and used in both clinical and research studies, typically one scan at 60 min and the other at 120 min, showing the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET by differentiating malignancy from inflammation and normal tissue. However, the current clinical dual-time-point FDG PET studies use the relative SUV change between two scans as the quantification index, which cannot eliminate the variations in tracer plasma clearance. Meanwhile, the dual-time-point protocol has not been optimized and standardized currently, leading to conflicting results. The fully-quantitative parameter, tracer net uptake rate constant Ki, is the most accurate parameter to quantify FDG PET, which is calculated using dynamic imaging with compartmental modeling. Ki is independent on the plasma clearance or acquisition start time. However, the long and complex acquisition protocol (typically at least 60 min), which requires dynamic scanning and sequential arterial blood sampling (or image-derived blood activity) used as input function from the time of injection, limits its application in clinical practice. Meanwhile, generation of the parametric Ki image, which can provide additional heterogeneity information for FDG PET, is challenging clinically using voxel-by-voxel compartmental modeling due to the computational cost and being sensitive to noise using non-linear least squares. The graphical Patlak plot, can be used for simplified Ki calculation and Ki image generation by voxel-by-voxel fitting. However, it still needs dynamic scanning starting from 15-30 min after injection and input function from the time of injection. The aims of this proposal are 1) to optimize the dual-time-point protocol for accurate Ki quantification using Patlak plot without the need for individual patient's input function, and 2) to generate high-quality low-noise dual-time-point Ki images using novel techniques based on deep learning. Upon the success of this project, our proposed approach can obtain reliable tumor Ki quantification and parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual- time-point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology. We expect the translation of this approach to clinical investigation to be fast, as this is a post-processing approach and is based on data already acquired using clinically used protocol without imposing additional burden to technologists. Project Narrative For FDG PET imaging, we propose to develop a novel and simple approach of quantifying tumor Ki and generating parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual-time- point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology.",Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans,9896329,R03EB027864,"['Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiolabeled', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'population based', 'research study', 'simulation', 'success', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,80375,0.19879399558074076
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9997783,R01AR074492,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Canes', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait rehabilitation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'kinetic model', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,435694,0.14214390954203693
"NeuroExplorer: Ultra-high Performance Human Brain PET Imager for Highly-resolved In Vivo Imaging of Neurochemistry Research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have been in place for over 40 years. The combination of quantitative PET systems with novel radiotracers has led to a numerous imaging para- digms to understand normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation. Brain-dedicated PET systems offer important advantages over currently available PET systems in terms of sensitivity and resolution. However, the state-of-the-art for brain PET has not progressed beyond the 20-year-old HRRT. Therefore, there is a compelling need to build the next generation of brain PET systems for human studies. This proposal brings together a highly experienced collaborative team from Yale, UC Davis, and United Imaging Healthcare America (UIHA). to develop the next generation NeuroEXPLORER (NX) PET system with the following Aims. Specific Aim 1: Design and Build the NeuroEXPLORER: In 2 years, we will complete the design and build the NX system. The design includes high performance LYSO-SiPM blocks with small detectors, 4-mm depth-of-interaction, 250 ps time-of-flight resolution, and axial length of ~50 cm, paired with CT for attenuation correction. This design will produce a factor of 10 greater effective sensitivity than the HRRT and practical resolution of 1.5-2 mm in the human brain. The system will include built-in real-time state-of-art motion tracking cameras and will be tested using novel phantom experiments to assess the full-range of operation to validate the dramatic improvement in small- region precision and accuracy. Specific Aim 2: Algorithm Development for Fully-Quantitative Brain PET. We will develop the novel algorithms for this system. Using EXPLORER experience. we will implement reconstruction algorithms to produce dynamic images with uniform ultra-high resolution in space and time, Extending Yale’s HRRT motion correction experience, we will develop camera-based motion detection and correction algorithms to deliver ultra-high resolution human brain images. Using the carotid artery shape and geometry, we will develop methods to accurately measure blood activity to be compared to human arterial data with the goal to permit kinetic modeling without arterial sampling. We will develop noise reduction methods with machine learning to reduce dose for studying health brains and to eliminate the need for the CT scan for attenuation correction. Specific Aim 3: Human Paradigm Demonstration. With human subjects, we will evaluate specific imaging paradigms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NX system: 1) demonstration of the dramatic sensitivity increase (with a direct comparison to the HRRT) and its impact on detection of pharmacologic effects, 2) leveraging high sensitivity to reliably measure uptake in small nuclei; and 3) opening new frontiers of imaging neurotransmitter dynamics, including dopamine and opioid release. The ultimate goal is a fully functioning and characterized system that dramatically expands the scope of brain PET protocols and applications. Human research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging have been in place for over 40 years and have led to a detailed understand of normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation.

"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,10015326,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'automated analysis', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,666434,0.24539283697626374
"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET.

"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer.

"Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Abstract PET is a molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology studies due to its high sensitivity and the potential of early diagnosis. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET has been recently used in clinical routine for imaging NETs in adult and pediatric patients since 2016. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of NETs. However, compared to 18F-FDG PET, the image quality of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is lower due to much larger positron range, shorter half-life, and lower dose administration limited by generator capacity. All of these compromises the lesion detectability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET, especially for small lesions, and can potentially lead to inaccurate NET diagnosis. As 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is increasingly used in clinics, there is an urgent and unmet need to further optimize 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging for NET detection. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed for PET image denoising, where the PET system model is not considered. As the tumor-to-background ratio of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is greater than 18F-FDG PET, the lesion recovery of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET can be hugely influenced by the smoothing effects as well as potential mismatches between training and testing datasets. In this study, we propose a novel data- informed and lesion detection-driven image reconstruction framework. The PET system model, image denoising module, and lesion-detection module will all be included in this reconstruction framework. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework and validate it based on comprehensive computer simulations, (2) to apply the proposed reconstruction framework to existing clinical 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT datasets and test it based on various figure-of-merits. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be a novel and robust image reconstruction framework to better recover lesions in a 68Ga- DOTATATE PET scan, which is essential for NET managements. Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection  Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology. This project aims to develop a novel lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework. Success of this project can enhance the lesion detectability of current PET imaging protocols, e.g. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).",Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection,10041119,R03EB030280,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gallium', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer type', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neuroendocrine differentiation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'pentetreotide', 'radiologist', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'routine imaging', 'success', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,94255,0.33351108125463375
"Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement Project Abstract Overview: This project aims to develop a novel 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI method with novel metal artifact correction techniques to provide early identification of painful complications in the prosthetic joint area causing persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Relevance: THA is one of the most rapidly growing procedures to treat the end-stage hip joint pain and dysfunction and is estimated to reach 572,000 annual cases by 2030. Unfortunately, a substantial number of patients experience PPSP after the procedure, which, without proper treatment, can significantly impair the quality of life. However, the early identification of pain generators for these patients is very difficult because the current diagnostic methods including X-ray, CT, and MRI, have limited sensitivity to pain and suffer from severe artifacts induced by metal in prostheses. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a novel diagnostic approach to accurately identify the abnormal inflammatory changes causing pain without prohibitive metal artifacts to guide the appropriate treatment matched to the exact cause of pain. Approach: We propose the use of 18F-FDG PET/MRI for early identification of sources of PPSP following THA. Our previous 18F-FDG PET/MRI study of chronic pain syndromes demonstrated promising improvements in detecting sites of painful inflammation. However, the severe metal artifacts near metallic prostheses limit the application of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to THA patients. Therefore, our first aim in this project is the development of metal-aware attenuation correction for PET to enable reliable 18F-FDG PET near the metallic prosthesis. Our second aim is the development of high-resolution hip MRI at 3T with metal artifact correction to maximize our ability to identify morphologic causes of PPSP symptoms. Our third aim is to validate the improvements in detection of the painful lesions using serial 18F-FDG PET/MRI sessions. This will be accomplished by correlating the pain score measurements with 18F-FDG PET/MRI abnormalities at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months following the unilateral THA procedure. Summary: We propose to develop a novel 18F-FDG PET/MRI method with metal artifact correction techniques for early detection of complications causing PPSP following THA. Successful implementation of our method will enable early indication of individualized, effective treatments for THA patients with PPSP. Project Narrative More than a million cases of total joint arthroplasty, including those with total hip arthroplasty (THA), are performed in the U.S. each year, but 7% to 34% of the patients are reported to develop persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) after these procedures. Unfortunately, the effective pain management for those patients is significantly limited by current diagnostic methods that have insufficient sensitivity to painful complications and severe imaging artifacts from the metallic prosthesis. Focusing on patients who have undergone THA, this project will develop metal artifact correction techniques for 18F-FDG PET/MRI to implement metabolic (18F-FDG PET) and morphologic (MRI) examination of PPSP following THA for enabling the early detection of painful pathology, and thus guiding appropriate treatments.",Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement,10226582,R56AR077706,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Arthralgia', 'Awareness', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip Prosthesis', 'Hip region structure', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physical shape', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Water', 'attenuation', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical examination', 'effective therapy', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pain score', 'pain symptom', 'serial imaging', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'uptake', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2020,577581,0.036158064051057044
"Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Abstract Candidate's Career Goals: Dr. Han has a strong background in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, image reconstruction and arterial spin labeling (ASL), with a Ph.D. in bio and brain engineering. Dr. Han is currently at a junior-faculty rank of instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). His goal is to expand his future career to multi-modality positron emission tomography (PET)-MR imaging for translational research and clinical improvement. His long-term goal is to become an independent, accomplished investigator that can lead future scientific and clinical imaging projects taking full advantage of multi-modality PET-MR imaging. Career Development Plan: Foundational training in PET/PET-MR imaging as well as neurology is proposed for the candidate, an area that the candidate currently lacks knowledge and experience in. The candidate plans to engage in formal course work/seminars, research via one-on-one instructions with mentors and collaborators, conferences/presentations, manuscript/grant preparations, and teaching/leadership roles to grow as an independent investigator in the field of PET-MR imaging and neurology. Research Project: The overall goal of the proposed research is to take advantage of simultaneous dynamic PET and ASL-MR imaging to estimate the permeability surface product (PS) of the PET tracer, which is new physiological information that cannot be obtained with PET or MR alone. PS describes the unidirectional flux rate of macromolecules from the blood plasma into the interstitial space of cellular tissue and is the key metric for assessing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Knowing the PS of the PET tracer provides powerful capability to probe the physiological delivery process of essential macromolecules involved in the pathogenesis of diseases in relation to BBB, due to the theoretically unlimiting potential in the design of radioactive analogs of important biological compounds. We plan to develop a PET tracer PS mapping method, achieve the first phantom and human study with PS mapping, and study the changes in the spatial distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and amyloid-beta (Aß) plaque depositions in relation to the BBB integrity changes with pathological events associated with the progression of AD, by performing dynamic-PET/mPLD-ASL studies using 18F-T807 and 11C- Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET tracers on AD and normal subjects. Environment: MGH provides an ideal setting for conducting research in MR, PET, and PET-MR imaging since multiple state-of-the-art imaging systems are available for preclinical/clinical MR scanners and preclinical simultaneous PET-MR scanners. There is a dynamic flow phantom designed to simulate blood flow for two compartment pharmacokinetics and an MR-compatible pump and detection system for continuous blood sampling suitable for performing ASL flow and PET imaging studies with arterial sampling. Also, there is a shared memory supercomputer ideal for the image reconstruction proposed in the project. MGH is also home to many experts in both PET-MR imaging and neurology who can provide their expertise to this project.
