"Shared and specific mechanisms of auditory and visual category learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability to learn new perceptual categories enables some of the most complex human behaviors, from speech perception to visual object recognition. Current understanding of the mechanisms involved in perceptual category learning relies on the fundamental assumption that the processes underlying such learning are shared across the senses. However, the vast majority of this work has focused on the visual modality. As a consequence, the research regarding how humans learn to group complex auditory information into categories has relied greatly on conclusions from the research in the visual domain without testing this critical assumption. However, recent evidence from the attention literature suggests that even seemingly domain-general cognitive processes, such as working memory, are accomplished via sensory-biased regions in frontal cortex. The current investigation will directly compare the computational and neural mechanisms supporting auditory and visual category learning by training the same individuals on categories in both modalities while in an fMRI scanner. Aim #1 of this investigation will identify the shared and sensory-biased circuits supporting feedback processing during auditory and visual category learning. If the neural circuits supporting perceptual category learning are shared across the modalities, it is expected that similar regions will be recruited to a similar extent during feedback processing. If instead, the neural circuits are distinct for particular modalities, it is expected that sensory-biased regions will emerge as supporting category learning for auditory and visual modalities. Aim #2 will utilize advanced machine learning techniques (multivariate pattern classification and representational similarity analyses) to characterize the emergence of category-level neural representations over the course of learning. Aim #3 will identify the functional and structural connectivity of the circuits as they contribute to perceptual category learning. The proposed research will directly test the fundamental assumption about the nature of this complex problem that affects everyday behaviors. This research has the potential to impact understanding of cases where modality- specific learning abilities might be impaired, such as phonetic learning and language-related impairments in dyslexia, autism, and specific language impairment. The proposed research will provide the training foundation to support the PI’s long-term objective of developing theories of perceptual category learning that are constrained by neurobiology and behavior and will specify the behavioral, computational, and neural mechanisms of such learning. This project presents the opportunity to directly test a critical assumption underlying understanding of perceptual category learning. The proposed research will take place in an exceptional training environment and the PI will be mentored by a team of knowledgeable and accomplished scientists. The research will provide the PI with training in functional magnetic resonance experiment design and analysis which will prepare her well for a career as an independent scientist in computational cognitive neuroscience. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about how seemingly general-purpose cognitive systems may demonstrate modality specificity. The goal of this investigation is to characterize the differences in cognitive processing during category learning when the information comes from the auditory or visual modalities. The findings from this work may inform mechanistic approaches to understanding modality- specific deficits in language-based disorders, such as dyslexia, autism, and specific language impairment.",Shared and specific mechanisms of auditory and visual category learning,10197776,F32DC018979,"['Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Esters ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' Hobbies ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Finches ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Word Blindness ', ' Dyslexia ', ' visual learning ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' object recognition ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Brain region ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive system ', ' learning ability ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning competence ', ' cognitive process ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2021,65994
"Novel Perceptual and Oculomotor Heuristics for Enhancing Radiologic Performance PROGRAM SUMMARY  Radiological imaging is often the first step of the diagnostic pathway for many devastating diseases; thus, an erroneous assessment of “normal” can lead to death. Whereas a grayscale object in an image can be described by its first-order image statistics—such as contrast, spatial frequency, position, entropy, and orientation—none of these dimensions, by itself, indicates abnormal vs normal radiological findings. We are a highly diverse team proposing an empirical approach to determine the mixtures of the first-order statistics—the “visual textures”— that radiology experts explicitly and implicitly use to identify the locations of potential abnormalities in medical images. Our innovative approach does not rely on assumptions about which textures may or may not be im-portant to abnormality detection. Instead, we will track the oculomotor behavior of expert radiologists to deter-mine their conscious and unconscious targeting choices, and thus ascertain which textures are empirically in-formative. The ability of expert radiologists to rapidly find abnormalities suggests that they may be able to first identify them in their retinal periphery. Peripheral visual analysis skills are therefore potentially critical to radio-logic performance, despite being understudied. We will measure these skills and leverage the results to develop perceptual learning heuristics to improve peripheral abnormality texture detection. By comparing novices to ex-perts we will determine whether the first are inexpert due to a lack of sensitivity to diagnostically relevant textures (texture informativeness), or to a lack of knowledge about which textures are abnormal, or to a combined lack of both sensitivity and knowledge. Radiology also requires the acquisition of oculomotor skills through practice and optimization. Radiologic expertise thus changes the oculomotor system in predictable and detectable ways, in much the same way that an athlete’s body and brain change as a function of expertise acquisition in their sport. We will therefore analyze both the consistency between experts’ fixation choices in medical images, and the eye movement performance characteristics of experts vs novice radiologists, to create an objective oculomotor bi-omarker of radiological expertise. The differences between novices and experts will train a deep learning (DL) system, which will have human visual and oculomotor performance characteristics. Training the DL with the abnormalities identified by a panel of expert radiologists will allow it to pinpoint the possible solutions in the manner of a simulated human radiologist performing at peak accuracy, precision, and speed. The resulting rank-ordered list of possible optimal and suboptimal image-reading strategies will serve as a benchmarking tool to quantify the performance of actual clinicians and residents who read the same images, rested vs fatigued. Meas-uring the effects of both training and fatigue on radiology expertise will be a major interdisciplinary cross-cutting advance in performance assessment. Our proposal to quantify fatigue in terms of erosion of expertise represents a transformational advance towards objective fitness-for-duty and expertise measures in medicine and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are 25-32 million perceptual errors in radiological case studies worldwide each year, contributing to med-ical error, the third most common cause of death in the US. We seek to reduce detection errors in radiology with four innovations: (1) we will empirically and objectively determine the visual textures used by expert radiologists to identify abnormalities within medical images; (2) we will determine the ways in which expert radiologists use their eyes, and especially their peripheral vision, to scan images and target informative regions; (3) we will de-velop a perceptual learning paradigm to optimally train residents in both texture perception and oculomotor per-formance domains; and (4) we will construct a deep learning model bestowed with simulated human visual and oculomotor capabilities, to create a normative model of human radiological expertise. The combined results from these studies will quantify peak expert performance and be employed to track and enhance individual expertise acquisition during radiology training; thus, the proposed research will help reduce medical error and moreover provide objective fitness-for-duty measurement tools—based on quantified biomarkers—to evaluate and ame-liorate the effects of fatigue on radiologic performance.",Novel Perceptual and Oculomotor Heuristics for Enhancing Radiologic Performance,10220201,R01CA258021,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Foundations ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incentives ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' North America ', ' Perception ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Residencies ', ' Rest ', ' Retina ', ' Societies ', ' Sports ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' CXR ', ' chest X ray ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest radiography ', ' lung radiography ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' thorax radiography ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Film ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' lung imaging ', ' Pulmonary imaging ', ' lung scanning ', ' Peripheral ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' radiologist ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Entropy ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Scanning ', ' Texture ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' ocular motor ', ' ocularmotor ', ' oculomotor ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' patient safety ', ' Radiologic Finding ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Clinical/Radiologic ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' shift work ', ' day shift ', ' night shift ', ' night work ', ' shiftwork ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' oculomotor behavior ', ' tool development ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' learning network ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' human error ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' deep learning ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' ']",NCI,SUNY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,646124
"Neural mechanisms of active vision in the fovea Neural mechanisms of active vision in the fovea In many ways human vision is like a camera, with a lens that forms an image on a spatially arranged sensor (the retina). However, it is unlike a camera because the sensor has uneven sampling and is constantly moving with the eyes. Recent behavioral and theoretical work suggest these eye movements serve a faciliatory role in high acuity vision – where the eye movements are part of the computations and enhance spatial resolution. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms to support this facilitation remain unknown. More broadly, little is known about the neural mechanisms that integrate across the retinal motion generated by eye movements, especially in the central visual field (the fovea). This is particularly important because over 8 million Americans suffer from central vision loss due to retinal disorders. Even if the retinal signals could be repaired, it is imperative to understand how the brain reads out foveal signals to ensure recovery of high-acuity visual processing, and fixational eye movements are a part of that process. The proposed career development plan aims to address these questions by measuring visual processing in the foveal representation of primary visual cortex (V1) during natural visual behavior. This proposal uses custom high-resolution eye-tracking, a novel visual foraging paradigm, largescale neurophysiology, and state-of-the-art machine learning to make these measurements possible. The proposed research will not only generate fundamental understanding of how eye-movements facilitate visual processing, but also will integrate the experimental and theoretical tools required to support neurophysiological studies of active visual processing without a loss of rigor or detail. The candidate has extensive expertise in awake- behaving neurophysiology and computational modeling and the training plan is designed to support his further training in statistical modeling, high-resolution eye-tracking, and modern machine-learning techniques for analyzing neural population data. The primary mentor, Dr. Daniel Butts, is a world expert in statistical models of neural activity during active vision; Co-mentor, Dr. Michele Rucci, is a world leader in high-resolution eye tracking and theoretical approaches to active vision; and Co-mentor, Dr. Jude Mitchell, is a pioneer in establishing the marmoset model of visual neuroscience and an expert in neurophysiology of visual attention. Together, they will provide the guidance to establish the candidate’s transition to a successful independent research career. The goal of this proposal is to identify the impact of fixational eye movements on neural representations in visual cortex in the central visual field. Over 9 million Americans have central vision loss from age-related macular degeneration.

"Natural image processing in the visual cortex Project Summary Signals from the natural environment are processed by neuronal populations in the cortex. Understanding the relationship between those signals and cortical activity is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating cortical processing of simple, parametric stimuli, and computational technology is improving descriptions of neural responses to naturalistic stimuli. However, how cortical populations encode the complex, natural inputs received during every day perceptual experience is largely unknown. This project aims to elucidate how natural visual inputs are represented by neuronal populations in primary visual cortex (V1). Progress to date has been limited primarily by two factors. First, during natural vision, the inputs to V1 neurons are always embedded in a spatial and temporal context, but how V1 integrates this contextual information in natural visual inputs is poorly understood. Second, prior work focused almost exclusively on single-neuron firing rate, but to understand cortical representations one must consider the structure of population activity— the substantial trial-to-trial variability that is shared among neurons and evolves dynamically—as this structure influences population information and perception. The central hypothesis of this project is that cortical response structure is modulated by visual context to approximate an optimal representation of natural visual inputs. To test the hypothesis, this project combines machine learning to quantify the statistical properties of natural visual inputs, with a theory of how cortical populations should encode those images to achieve an optimal representation, to arrive at concrete, falsifiable predictions for V1 response structure. The predictions will be tested with measurements of population activity in V1 of awake monkeys viewing natural images and movies. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether modulation of V1 response structure by spatial context in static images is consistent with optimal encoding of those images, and will compare the predictive power of the proposed model to alternative models. Specific Aim 2 addresses V1 encoding of dynamic natural inputs, and will test whether modulation of V1 activity by temporal context is tuned to the temporal structure of natural sensory signals, as required for optimality. As both spatial and temporal are present simultaneously during natural vision, Specific Aim 3 will determine visual input statistics in free-viewing animals, and test space-time interactions in V1 activity evoked by those inputs. This project will provide the first test of a unified functional theory of contextual modulation in V1 encoding of natural visual inputs, and shed light on key aspects of natural vision that have been neglected to date. Project Narrative This project aims to determine how neurons in the visual cortex represent the inputs encountered during perceptual experience in the natural environment, through correct integration of visual information across space and time. In individuals with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, integration is often miscalibrated leading to perceptual impairments. Our study will advance knowledge of the relationship between natural sensory inputs and cortical activity, which is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in patient populations.",Natural image processing in the visual cortex,10219265,R01EY030578,"['Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motion ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Perception ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Sensory ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' movie ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neglect ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' V1 neuron ', ' vision science ', ' visual science ', ' visual information ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' patient population ', ' sensory input ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' ']",NEI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,404975
"Access to parietal action representations after stroke lesions in visual cortex PROJECT SUMMARY  The ability to recognize and use objects according to their function (e.g., fork, hammer, pencil) requires integration of visual, semantic and action knowledge across occipital, temporal and parietal areas. Left parietal regions support critical aspects of object-directed action, such as grasping and object manipulation. This research activity uses a combination of fMRI and behavioral measures in patients with ischemic strokes to early and extrastriate visual areas to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1: There is a visual pathway to the parietal grasp region (aIPS) that bypasses processing in primary visual cortex. Aim 2: Left ventral extrastriate cortex is necessary to access manipulation information for visually presented objects. Aim 3A: Ballistic grasping actions to objects in the hemianopic field are influenced by volumetric properties (size, orientation) of targets. Aim 3B: Left ventral extrastriate lesions impair object function (e.g., `scissors used to cut') and disrupt access to manipulation knowledge from visual input. The research leverages strengths of fMRI (whole brain correlational measure) and neuropsychology (causal inference) to test new hypotheses about vision and action.  `Tools' (i.e., small manipulable objects) are an excellent domain in which to address broader questions about the integration of sensory, motor and cognitive processing. This is because tool recognition and tool use require the integration of distinct sensory, motor and cognitive representations, and the neural substrates of tool processing are well described. The research program emphasizes fresh perspectives on longstanding ideas about the dorsal and ventral visual pathways, by a) undertaking the first systematic investigation of the types of information about objects that are extracted by visual pathways that bypass primary visual cortex, and by b) studying how some parietal areas depend on inputs from the ventral stream in order to access the correct action for a given object. The research activity innovates by testing hypotheses about how lesions at different stages in the cortical visual hierarchy affect downstream processing in parietal cortex, combining neural and behavioral measures to study brain damaged patients (generating causal evidence), and by combining univariate and multivariate measures to `read out' the information content of brain regions (parietal cortex) that are anatomically remote from a lesion. The research advances understanding of how lesions in one brain region disrupt computations in other parts of the brain that depend on the damaged region for their inputs, a phenomenon (`dynamic diaschisis') that applies to brain injury generally. Advancing understanding of these basic issues using causal data has broad implications for understanding how the brain selects the correct action for the correct object, and more generally for theories of conceptual organization and causal reasoning. Understanding how the brain accesses actions from visual input has implications for related fields, such as robotics, neuroprosthetics, and evidenced based approaches for rehabilitating function after brain injury. Project Narrative Functional MRI and behavioral testing are used to test hypotheses about how strokes affecting occipital and temporal cortex disrupt access to action representations in parietal cortex.

"Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations Project Summary/Abstract The mammalian brain builds and transforms representations of the outside world through the concerted activity of populations of neurons, but the extent to which spike times or spike counts are coordinated within these ensembles beyond pairs is not clear. Models of neural encoding predict variable frequencies of spike pattern occurrence, and models of decoding delineate requirements for spike time precision within the population response. While considerable effort has been made toward the development and refinement of the theoretical basis of such neural coding schemes, and predictions have been tested against single cell and pairwise data, there has been relatively little experimental data beyond pairs able to differentiate between competing hypotheses of population coding. The proposed career development plan aims to marry large-scale electrophysiology in primary visual cortex with analysis of specific predictions derived from computational and theoretical neuroscience work for spike time coordination beyond pairwise interactions. The candidate has a deep background in in vivo experimental techniques and proposes to receive training in the high-dimensional computational techniques and to use experimental data collected to validate specific theoretical predictions. This training will establish the skills necessary for a successful independent research career studying the mechanisms of information representation and transfer in visual cortex, bridging the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience. The candidate will carry out the mentored phase under the guidance of Dr. Clay Reid, a world expert in multiple aspects of mammalian central visual processing including anatomy, physiology, and computation. Additional advising from Dr. Eric Shea- Brown and Dr. Christof Koch will provide guidance in the theoretical and applied mathematical approaches required to implement and assess advanced models of neural encoding and decoding. The training will utilize the strengths of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in collecting large-scale data and the didactic opportunities at the University of Washington. In the independent phase the candidate will use the newly acquired analytical and modeling skills in combination with his previous training in optogenetic techniques to better constrain population measurements. This work will help establish a unique independent research program to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cortical representation. Project Narrative Understanding how the brain uses population activity to build representations of the outside world is an important step towards understanding not only sensory but also psychiatric and other cognitive disorders.

"Virtual prototyping for retinal prosthesis patients Project Summary/Abstract Retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration induce progressive loss of photoreceptors, resulting in profound visual impairment in more than ten million people worldwide. Visual neuroprostheses (‘bionic eyes’) aim to restore functional vision by electrically stimulating remaining cells in the retina, analogous to cochlear implants. A wide variety of neuroprostheses are either in development (e.g. optogenetics, cortical) or are being implanted in patients (e.g. subretinal or epiretinal electrical). A limiting factor that affects all device types are perceptual distortions and subsequent loss of information, caused by interactions between the implant technology and the underlying neurophysiology. Understanding the causes of these distortions and finding ways to alleviate them is critically important to the success of current and future sight restoration technologies. In this proposal, human visual psychophysics, computational modeling, data-driven approaches, and virtual reality (VR) will be combined to develop and experimentally validate optimized stimulation protocols for epiretinal prostheses. This approach is analogous to virtual prototyping for airplanes and other complex systems: to use a high-quality model of both the implant electronics and the visual system in order to generate a ‘virtual patient’. Retinal electrophysiological and visual behavioral data will be used to develop and validate a computational model of the expected visual experience of patients when electrically stimulated. One way of using this model will be to generate simulations of the expected perceptual outcome of electrical stimulation across a wide variety of electrical stimulation patterns. These will be used as a training set for machine learning algorithms that will invert the input-output function of the model to find the electrical stimulation protocol that best replicates any desired perceptual experience. The model can also be used to simulate the expected perceptual experience of real patients by using sighted subjects in a VR environment – ‘VR virtual patients’. These virtual patients will be used to discover preprocessing methods (e.g., edge enhancement, retargeting, decluttering) that improve behavioral performance in VR. Although current retinal prostheses have been implanted in over 250 patients worldwide, experimentation with improved stimulation protocols remains challenging and expensive. Implementing ‘virtual patients’ in VR offers an affordable and practical alternative for high-throughput experiments to test new stimulation protocols. Stimulation protocols that result in good VR performance will be experimentally validated in real prosthesis patients in collaboration with Second Sight Medical Products Inc. and Pixium Vision, two leading device manufacturers in the field. This work has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness of visual neuroprostheses as a treatment option for individuals suffering from blinding retinal diseases. Project Narrative Inadequate stimulation paradigms are currently one of the main factors limiting the effectiveness of visual prostheses as a treatment option for individuals suffering from blinding retinal diseases. My goal is to develop and validate novel stimulation protocols for visual prosthesis patients that minimize perceptual distortions and thereby improve behavioral performance.

"Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina Studies of the visual system face a number of challenges, two of which are the intricacy of the cell types and synaptic connections that comprise the nervous system, and the complexity of the computational processes that underlie vision. Although the retina is one of the most characterized and well understood neural circuits of the visual system, it nonetheless has a great diversity of cell types, connections and computations. The normal function of the retina is to convey information about natural visual scenes, which have complex spatial and temporal structure. The processing of natural scenes has the greatest relevance towards a fundamental understanding retinal function, and the greatest clinical relevance. Yet most studies of retinal visual processing and circuitry focus on responses to simple artificial stimuli rarely encountered normally, such as flashing spots, drifting stripes and flickering checkerboards. With respect to retinal cell types greatest diversity lies in a class of inhibitory interneurons known as amacrine cells. These cells make extensive lateral and feedback connections, and although they form stereotyped connections between each other, excitatory bipolar cells, and ganglion cells that transit signals in the optic nerve, the functional effects of nearly all of these cell types are poorly understood. This proposal aims towards a direct characterization of the functional effects of amacrine cells under ethologically relevant stimuli, including natural scenes. We combine approaches of perturbation and recording using electrical and optical methods as well as computational modeling to characterize the specific contributions of amacrine cells to stimuli that include the representation of moving objects. We take advantage of recently developed computational approaches that can simultaneously capture the retinal response to a broad range of stimuli including natural scenes, capture a wide range of phenomena previously characterized only with artificial stimuli, and that have internal units highly correlated with retinal interneurons. Our goals are to 1) Create a quantitative understanding of the functional contributions of a class of sustained amacrine cells in the salamander retina for specific stimuli including those that represent moving objects and natural scenes, and test hypotheses related to dynamic effects on visual sensitivity and sensory features generated by those amacrine cells 2) Use molecularly defined amacrine cells in the mouse to quantitatively characterize the functional contribution of specific amacrine cell types to specific stimuli including artificial moving objects and natural scenes. These studies create a new way to generate and test hypotheses related to the quantitative effect of any interneuron on retinal output under any visual stimulus. Understanding how retinal circuitry creates visual processing under natural scenes is critical to our understanding of retinal mechanisms and diseases involving the degeneration of the retinal circuitry. In addition, the computational descriptions of retinal responses will be directly useful in the design of electronic retinal prosthesis systems. The retina is a complex network of many cell types, including the most diverse but poorlyunderstood class of cells, amacrine cells. By understanding how inhibitory neurons change neural processing in the retina under natural visual scenes, we can begin to address how these cells and their connections degenerate during retinal diseases, an essential step in designing treatments for these diseases. Furthermore, by creating accurate computational models of the retinal response to natural scenes, this research will be immediately applicable to electronic retinal prosthesis systems that aim to restore vision in cases of photoreceptor degeneration.",Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina,10086475,R01EY022933,"['Archives ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Theoretical Studies ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Salamander ', ' Lateral ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' Amacrine Cells ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' receptive field ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Optical Methods ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' photoreceptor degeneration ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' retinal prosthesis ', ' artificial retina ', ' prosthetic retina ', ' retinal prosthetic ', ' biological systems ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Injections ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' sight restoration ', ' restore sight ', ' restore vision ', ' vision restoration ', ' ']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,380427
"Infants' self-generated visual statistics support object and category learning PROJECT SUMMARY Human visual object recognition is remarkable in its ability to recognize individual objects in challenging circumstances and to rapidly recognize even novel instances of tens of thousands of everyday categories. Although a great deal is known about these processes at maturity, very little is known about their development especially with respect to common everyday objects and the experiences that support robust object recognition and categorization. This gap is critical because object recognition and categorization support early word learning, physical problem solving, and the later learning of orthographies and mathematical symbols. This research projects focuses on visual object learning in 1 year old toddlers, a developmental period that at the front end of marked advances in visual object recognition and a period in which children with multiple risk factors begin to fall behind the normative developmental trajectory. The approach focuses on the properties of real- world visual experiences that support learning to recognize individual objects in challenging visual contexts and generalizing that learning to same category members. The method uses head-mounted eye-trackers to capture field-of-view images from 100 infants 17 to 22 months of age as they spontaneously interact and play with objects. Through active interactions with objects infants generates their own packets of visual data for learning. Multiple visual properties relevant to object perception will be algorithmically measured and quantified. Toddlers’ recognition of the actively-engaged object and a novel object from the same category will be measured in challenging benchmark contexts including clutter, occlusion, and different views. Category generalization will be measured in a name generalization task. Advanced statistics and machine learning will determine the visual properties of self-generated experiences that support infants object recognition and categorization. The research will provide the first characterization of the natural visual statistics of toddlers’ active interactions with objects and potentially transformative evidence that the developmental foundation for human prowess in visual object categorization lies not in experiences with many different instances of a single category, the standard assumption, but in active visual experiences with individual objects. Moreover, infants at risk for Developmental Language Delay and Autism show disruptions in early object name learning that have been recently linked to disruptions in visual learning about objects. The project includes preliminary analyses of infants at risk in preparation for the next step in the long-term research program. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because visual object recognition and learning is implicated in broad array of cognitive tasks in early the learning of first words, reading and learning the symbol systems of mathematic; the continued risks of children treated for amblyopia and strabismus in perceptual, cognitive and school achievements and the nexus of disrupted visual learning and lexical development in children with Developmental Language Delay and Autism. Understanding infants self-generated active visual experiences is expected to give rise to new diagnostics and behavioral interventions for at-risk infants.

"Acquisition, extinction, and recall of attention biases to threat: Computational modeling and multimodal brain imaging Project Summary Classical aversive conditioning is a well-established laboratory model for studying acquisition and extinction of defensive responses. In experimental animals, as well as in humans, research to date has been mainly focused on the role of limbic structures (e.g., the amygdala) in these responses. Recent evidence has begun to stress the important contribution by the brain’s sensory and attention control systems in maintaining the neural representations of conditioned responses and in facilitating their extinction. The proposed research breaks new ground by combining novel neuroimaging techniques with advanced computational methods to examine the brain’s visual and attention processes underlying fear acquisition and extinction in humans. Major advances will be made along three specific aims. In Aim 1, we characterize the brain network dynamics of visuocortical threat bias formation, extinction, and recall in a two-day learning paradigm. In Aim 2, we establish and test a computational model of threat bias generalization. In Aim 3, we examine the relation between individual differences in generalization and recall of conditioned visuocortical threat biases and individual differences in heightened autonomic reactivity to conditioned threat, a potential biomarker for assessing the predisposition to developing the disorders of fear and anxiety. It is expected that accomplishing these research aims will address two NIMH strategic priorities: defining the circuitry and brain networks underlying complex behaviors (Objective 1) and identifying and validating new targets for treatment that are derived from the understanding of disease mechanisms (Objective 3). It is further expected that this project will enable a paradigm shift in research on dysfunctional attention to threat from one that focuses primarily on limbic-prefrontal circuits to one that emphasizes the interactions among sensory, attention, executive control and limbic systems. Project Narrative The learning and un-learning of a fear response through conditioning and extinction learning is a process that is of interest not only for basic neuroscience research, but also for clinical intervention and diagnostic procedures in a variety of psychiatric disorders. In the present proposal, building on strong preliminary data that suggest a pivotal role of visual and attention systems, along with limbic structures, in aversive learning, we seek to use simultaneous EEG-fMRI, combined with computational modeling and advanced analytical techniques including machine learning, to characterize—in time and space—the dynamics and communication within and among the brain’s visual, attention and limbic networks during the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear in healthy populations. Furthermore, testing of the proposed computational model on a community sample stratified by their cardiac reactivity to threat will advance our understanding of the model’s capability to differentiate individual differences in threat response, and lay the foundation for identifying new biomarkers and treatment targets for disorders of fear, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress.","Acquisition, extinction, and recall of attention biases to threat: Computational modeling and multimodal brain imaging",10296986,R01MH125615,"['Acceleration ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' Deceleration ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Emotions ', ' Visual evoked cortical potential ', ' Visual Evoked Potentials ', ' Visual Evoked Response ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Limbic System ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Perception ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Conditioned Reflex ', ' conditioned response ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' learning extinction ', ' Measurement ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Visual attention ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' aversive conditioning ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' fear conditioning ', ' conditioned fear ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' conditioning ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' visual neuroscience ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' post-trauma stress ', ' posttrauma stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' attentional control ', ' attentional bias ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,450166
"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,10448533,R44AG060857,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Clocks ', ' Biologic Clock ', ' body clock ', ' internal clock ', ' Building Codes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Moods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phototherapy ', ' Actinotherapy ', ' Light Therapy ', ' Photoradiation Therapy ', ' light treatment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retina ', ' Rotation ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' Measurement ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' meter ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' alertness ', ' Dose ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' active control ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' circadian pacemaker ', ' circadian clock ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' biological systems ', ' cloud based ', ' health data ', ' circadian ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' appropriate dose ', ' optimal drug dosage ', ' optimal drug dose ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIA,"BLUE IRIS LABS, INC.",R44,2021,18000
"Statistical Unsupervised Learning VF for IIHTT & ONTT Summary Current assessments of visual field testing depend on algorithms, principally developed to diagnose and monitor progression in glaucoma, or on expert descriptive categorization of deficits. The algorithms do not work well for non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies as these disorders can both improve and deteriorate. Descriptive categorizations are not readily quantifiable to assess change over time. Unsupervised statistical learning archetypal analysis is a new way to investigate glaucoma and potentially other optic neuropathies. Both idiopathic intracranial hypertension and optic neuritis are disorders that often improve and respond to therapy. Archetypal analysis of the visual fields from two NEI sponsored clinical trials on each disorder, ONTT and IIHTT, will be investigated to determine if the findings parallel the reported outcomes and effects of therapy. We will also test whether machine learning quantifiable archetypes, which are disease-associated patterns of field deficits, are similar to expert determinations, whether they are sensitive to changes in optic nerve function, and if they reveal residual optic nerve dysfunction in eyes reported to be normal by prior study criteria. Adding cases of IIH and optic neuritis from the clinic will enhance the archetypes for each disorder for use in the clinic and new studies. Narrative Analysis of the visual fields of patients with optic neuropathies using machine learning will improve the evaluation and provide objective measurement, rather than the current descriptive methods.

"Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness ABSTRACT  It is essential for the fate of an organism that key morphogenetic processes occur reproducibly even under tissue damage or environmental perturbations. While much is known about how genetic redundancy and regulation achieves robust development, less is understood about how a tissue mechanically ensures reproducible shape change when perturbed. This project uncovers how populations of physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their collective behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape.  One way for cells to coordinate tissue-scale forces and movements is through direct mechanical connections. In fact, many developing tissues exhibit supracellular networks of actomyosin connections that link hundreds of cells. A large roadblock has been with the challenges of imaging and quantifying subcellular protein at the tissue scale. I adapted a topological smoothing algorithm originally used to trace high-noise filamentous structure of galaxies in the Universe to data to trace high-noise filamentous myosin structure in confocal images. This allowed for the first quantification of a supracellular myosin network across an entire tissue over developmental time. Subsequent analysis adopting techniques from network theory allowed me to identify that the robust folding of the Drosophila fruit fly embryo during ventral furrow formation is mechanically ensured by patterns in the supracellular network spanning its ventral cells.  This newly discovered importance of supracellular networks in coordinating robust shape change highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of how supracellular networks form, and how their patterns impact the function and robustness of a population of cells. Deciphering robustness at the tissue-level, where the displacement and fate of hundreds of cells must be considered, requires techniques at the interface of cell and developmental biology, biophysics and computer science. The proposed project will take a highly interdisciplinary approach to identify how supracellular network patterns are controlled molecularly, at the cell level, and via tissue constraints. As well, how heterogeneity in tissue-level patterns impacts morphogenetic robustness will be addressed. Together this comprehensive study of the structure and function of supracellular networks will represent a new way to interpret mechanical robustness across diverse developing tissues. As well, a generalized description of mechanical robustness has the potential to uncover new paths to predict and control tissue malformation, which would represent a significant advance for both developmental biology and fetal medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE The robust establishment of correct shape is essential for proper tissue function. Tissue shape change is a mechanical process that necessitates the coordinated force generation and motion of thousands of cells. Identifying how physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape will shed light onto many congenital disorders that result from morphogenetic dysregulation.",Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness,10261353,K99GM136915,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Actomyosin ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Myosin ATPase ', ' Actin-Activated ATPase ', ' Myosin Adenosine Triphosphatase ', ' Myosin Adenosinetriphosphatase ', ' Myosins ', ' Neural Tube Defects ', ' Neural Tube Developmental Defects ', ' Noise ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Proteins ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' Cell Size ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Congenital Disorders ', ' Galaxy ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' fetal ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohesion ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Population ', ' malformation ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' fetal medicine ', ' optogenetics ', ' mechanical properties ', ' mechanical force ', ' Maternal-fetal medicine ', ' confocal imaging ', ' tissue-level behavior ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2021,98836
"CRCNS: Probabilistic models of perceptual grouping/segmentation in natural vision   To understand and navigate the environment, sensory systems must solve simultaneously two competing and challenging tasks: the segmentation of a sensory scene into individual objects and the grouping of elementary sensory features to build these objects. Understanding perceptual grouping and segmentation is therefore a major goal of sensory neuroscience, and it is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision. To make progress in understanding image segmentation and improving algorithms, this project combines two key components. First, a new experimental paradigm that allows for well-controlled measurements of perceptual segmentation of natural images. This addresses a major limitation of existing data that are either restricted to artificial stimuli, or, for natural images, rely on manual labeling and conflate perceptual, motor, and cognitive factors. Second, this project involves developing and testing a computational framework that accommodates bottom-up information about image statistics and top-down information about objects and behavioral goals. This is in contrast with the paradigmatic view of visual processing as a feedforward cascade of feature detectors, that has long dominated computer vision algorithms and our understanding of visual processing. The proposed approach builds instead on the influential theory that perception requires probabilistic inference to extract meaning from ambiguous sensory inputs. Segmentation is a prime example of inference on ambiguous inputs: the pixels of an image often cannot be labeled with certainty as grouped or segmented. This project will test the hypothesis that human visual segmentation is a process of hierarchical probabilistic inference. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether the measured variability of human segmentations reflects the uncertainty predicted by the model, as required for well-calibrated probabilistic inference. Specific Aim 2 addresses how feedforward and feedback processing in human segmentation contribute to efficient integration of visual features across different levels of complexity, from small contours to object parts. Specific Aim 3 will determine reciprocal interactions between perceptual segmentation and top-down influences including: semantic scene content; visual texture discrimination; and expectations reflecting environmental statistics. The proposed approach models these influences as Bayesian priors, and thus, if supported by the proposed experiments, will offer a unified framework to understand the integration of bottom-up and top- down influences in human segmentation of natural inputs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project aims to provide a unified understanding of perceptual segmentation and grouping of visual inputs encountered in the natural environment, through correct integration of the information contained in the visual inputs with top-down information about objects and behavioral goals. This understanding is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision in patient populations.

"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity. We propose to commercialize a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscope to enable non-invasive, high-definition, wide field of view imaging in 3D for eye banks.","High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging",10172909,R44EY028827,"['Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal ', ' Corneal Diseases ', ' Corneal Disorder ', ' cornea disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye Banks ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' instrumentation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Research ', ' Rights ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Donors ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Tissue Transplantation ', ' Cell Density ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cell Viability Process ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' cell morphology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' in vivo regeneration ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' screening ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Innovation Corps ', ' I-Corps ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' neurosensory ', ' neuro-sensory ', ' clinical imaging ', ' clinical development ', ' Patient imaging ', ' three-dimensional visualization ', ' 3-D visualization ', ' 3-dimensional visualization ', ' 3D visualization ', ' Regenerative capacity ', ' regeneration ability ', ' regeneration capacity ', ' ']",NEI,LIGHTOPTECH CORPORATION,R44,2021,695219
"Enhancing Assisted Reproductive Technologies with Deep Learning and Data Visualization PROJECT SUMMARY Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) is a clinical treatment for infertile couples who want to achieve a pregnancy. In ART, embryologists fertilize eggs retrieved from the patient or a donor, culture the resulting embryos in vitro, and then transfer the selected embryo(s) to the mother's uterus. While ART is responsible for 1.9% of babies born in the United States as of 2018, selecting which embryo to transfer is a signiﬁcant challenge. The difﬁculty comes from the complexity of confounding factors and the lack of understanding of human pre-implantation embryo development. Because of this difﬁculty, multiple embryos are often transferred to increases the potential of success, resulting in multiple pregnancy rates of nearly 20%, which can lead to signiﬁcant morbidity and medical expenses to patients. The ideal is to transfer only a single embryo, but this necessitates the ability to select the best embryo from a cohort. Here, we propose to create a clinical decision support system to improve embryo selection in ART. To this end, we will develop novel deep learning models for robust embryo feature extraction and interactive data visualization methods for human-in-the-loop analysis. We will ﬁrst extract and analyze visual features from routinely collected images of embryos. We will then combine these visual features with patients' electronic health record (EHR) data to develop interpretable computation models that score embryos on their viability. We plan to integrate our machine learning solutions into an easily accessible cloud service platform that will be adaptable across clinics to improve ART embryo selection and clinical data analysis. Our research goals will be achieved by novel machine learning-based models for morphological feature extrac- tion and importance estimation of each confounding factor and a clinical decision support system for ART. For morphological feature extraction, we plan to conduct semi-supervised learning of convolutional neural networks to minimize manual labeling that requires extensive human effort. Our feature extraction model will be the ﬁrst comprehensive classiﬁcation and segmentation method for ART. To aid in embryo selection, we will develop novel deep learning-based models to predict probabilities of achieving pregnancy by accepting visual features and EHR data as the input. We will also develop visual analytic tools that allow analysts to better understand and steer these deep learning models. We will estimate the importance of each input interpretable factor in embryo selection to explain the prediction to embryologists. Finally, we will develop EmbryoProﬁler, a clinical decision support system for ART, that combines our machine learning-based models with a user-facing suite of visual analytic tools to support user guidance and clinical decision making. EmbryoProﬁler will help facilitate daily operation in clinics, foster human-guided decision making, enrich data-driven embryo analysis, and enhance the ability to select the developmentally most competent embryo for transfer to improve ART success rates. Our project will create state-of-the-art analysis approaches for ART clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is a widespread treatment for infertility, over 300,000 treatment cycles were performed in the US in 2018, but success rates remain low. In this project, we will develop novel machine learning algorithms and a clinical decision support system to assist embryologists in embryo selection. Our tools will also enable embryologists and biologists to obtain new information on the earliest stages of human embryo development, which will advance the fundamental science of human biology and lead to further improvements in ART practice.",Enhancing Assisted Reproductive Technologies with Deep Learning and Data Visualization,10185936,R01HD104969,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Couples ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Transfer ', ' embryo transplantation ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mothers ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' Multiple Pregnancy ', ' Multiple gestation pregnancy ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' United States ', ' Uterus ', ' womb ', ' zygote ', ' Fertilized Egg ', ' Fertilized Ovum ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' data management ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Assisted Reproduction Technology ', ' assistive reproductive technology ', ' Assisted Reproductive Technology ', ' embryo cell ', ' embryo monitoring ', ' model design ', ' Blastosphere ', ' Preimplantation Embryo ', ' blastula ', ' pre-implantation embryo ', ' blastocyst ', ' Pre-implantation development ', ' Preimplantation Embryo Development ', ' Preimplantation development ', ' Pre-implantation Embryo Development ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Security ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' analytical tool ', ' implantation ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Secure ', ' operation ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' Cloud Service ', ' infertility treatment ', ' fertility assistance ', ' fertility interventions ', ' fertility treatment ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' multi-task learning ', ' multitask learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Visualization ', ' data cleaning ', ' data cleansing ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' feature extraction ', ' data curation ', ' ']",NICHD,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,730410
"Human Face Representation in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks The human visual system can recognize a familiar face across wide variations of viewpoint, illumination, expression, and appearance. This remarkable computational feat is accomplished by large-­scale networks of neurons. We will test a face space theory of the representations that emerge at the top layer of deep learning convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as a model of human visual representations of faces. Computer-based face recognition has improved in recent years due to DCNNs and the easy availability of labeled training data (faces and identities) from the web. Inspired by the primate visual system, DCNNs are feed­forward artificial neural networks that can map images of faces into representations that support recognition over widely variable images. Although the calculations executed by the simulated neurons are simple, enormous numbers of computations are used to convert an image into a representation. The end result of this processing is a highly compact representation of a face that retains image detail in an invariant, identity­-specific face code. This code is fundamentally different than any representation of faces considered in vision science. This theory we test combines key components of previous face space models (similarity, learning history) with new features (imaging conditions, personal face history) in a unitary space that represents both identity and facial appearance across variable images. We will test whether this model can account for human recognition of familiar faces, which is highly robust to image variability (pose, illumination, expression). The model will also be applied to understanding long standing difficulties humans (and machines) have with faces of other races. We aim to bridge critical gaps in our knowledge of how DCNNs work, linking psychological, neural, and computational perspectives. A fundamentally new theory of face representation will alter the questions we ask about face representations in all three fields. A new focus on understanding how we (or neural networks) “perceive” a single familiar identity in widely variable images will give rise to a search for representations that gracefully merge the properties of faces with the real-­world image conditions in which they are experienced. This project presents a unique opportunity to study, manipulate, and learn from these representations, and to apply the findings to broader questions about high-­level vision from neural and perceptual perspectives. Human recognition of familiar faces is highly robust to image variability (pose, illumination, expression)—a skill that is likely due to the quality and quantity of experience we have with the faces of people we know well. Deep convolutional neural networks are modeled after the primate visual system and have made impressive gains recently on the problem of robust face recognition. Understanding the visual nature of the face “feature” codes that emerge in these networks can give insight into long-standing questions about how the human visual system can, but does not always, represent a face in a way that generalizes across images that vary widely.",Human Face Representation in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,10129967,R01EY029692,"['Affect ', ' Computers ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Published Comment ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Space Models ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Familiarity ', ' skills ', ' Categories ', ' Appearance ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Data ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Face Processing ', ' facial processing ', ' vision science ', ' visual science ', ' representation theory ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' feedforward neural network ', ' feed forward neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R01,2021,361998
"Shape Analysis Toolbox: From medical images to quantitative insights of anatomy PROJECT SUMMARY Three-dimensional shape lies at the core of understanding the physical objects that surround us.

Over the past four years, we have been successful in increasing the ease of use and effectiveness of state-of-the-art shape analysis methodology for biomedical researchers in need of such techniques. We now propose necessary and novel enhancements to our methods and our dissemination model in order to continue maximizing the success of SALT. We will also modify the architecture of SALT to better integrate biomedical imaging research workflows by improving the efficiency and scripting capabilities so SlicerSALT can be deployed in batch mode for large-scale sequential computations.

"Intelligent Intensive Care Unit (I2CU): Pervasive Sensing and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Clinical Decision-making Project Summary Although close monitoring and dynamic assessment of patient acuity are key aspects of ICU care, both are limited by the time constraints imposed on healthcare providers. Currently, dynamic and precise assessment of patient’s acuity in ICU rely almost exclusively on physicians’ clinical judgment and vigilance. Furthermore, important visual assessment details, such as facial expressions, posture, and mobility, are captured sporadically by overburdened nurses or are not captured at all. However, these visual assessment details are associated with critical indices such as physical function, pain and subsequent clinical deterioration. The PIs’ long-term goal is to sense, quantify, and communicate patient’s clinical condition in an autonomous and precise manner. The overall objective of this application is to develop the novel tools for sensing, quantifying, and communicating any patient’s condition in an autonomous, precise, and interpretable manner. The central hypothesis is that deep learning models will be superior to existing acuity clinical scores by predicting acuity in a dynamic, precise, and interpretable manner, using autonomous assessment of pain, emotional distress and physical function, together with clinical and physiologic data. The hypothesis has been formulated based on preliminary data and is well-grounded in clinical care literature. The rationale is that autonomous and precise patient quantification can result in enhanced clinical workflow and early intervention. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction of the patient’s clinical status to determine if it is more accurate in predicting daily care transition outcomes, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a pervasive sensing system for autonomous visual assessment of critically ill patients to determine if it can provide accurate visual assessment of a patient compared to human expert, and if it can enrich acuity prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Implementing and evaluating an intelligent platform for real- time integration of autonomous visual assessment and acuity prediction in clinical workflow to determine accuracy in real-time prospective evaluation and to determine physicians’ risk perception and satisfaction. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise patient trajectory, (2) autonomously perform visual assessment in the ICU, and (3) implement artificial intelligence platform in real time in clinical workflow. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care, including (1) lack of precise and real-time prediction of clinical trajectory, (2) manual repetitive ICU assessments, and (3) uncaptured patient aspects. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong complications. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it can result in enhanced critical care workflow and early critical care intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing hospitalization costs.

This proposal aims at developing the hardware system that will allow acquisition of fundus photographs using the nGoggle, a portable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) which integrates a wearable, wireless, electroencephalogram (EEG) system and a head-mounted display to monitor electrical brain activities associated with visual field stimulation. In a previous project, we developed the nGoggle portable system for the assessment of visual function deficits in order to address limitations of standard automated perimetry (SAP), a traditional but subjective visual field test. We compared the diagnostic accuracies of the nGoggle and SAP in discriminating patients with glaucoma from healthy subjects and found that the BCI performed at least as well, if not better than SAP, with the additional advantage of portability and objectivity.  With rapid advancements in smartphone cameras, it is now possible to develop compact auto-focusing fundus cameras and integrate them into our neuro-monitoring nGoggle. Recently we developed an approach named Machine-to-Machine (M2M), a deep learning algorithm that was trained to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and neuroretinal rim provided by spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT), with high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This approach opens up the possibility of using simple fundus photographs to extract quantitative information about neural damage in glaucoma. By combining functional assessment currently provided by the nGoggle with structural assessment capability, this new system would result in a very unique device capable of portable structural and functional assessment of optic nerve damage for a multitude of eye conditions, not limited to glaucoma, such as age-related macular degeneration, retinal degenerations and non-glaucomatous optic neu- ropathies.  The specific aims of this Phase I SBIR project are (1) to incorporate a high-resolution auto-focusing fundus camera to the nGoggle head-mounted display in full compliance with ophthalmic instrument safety stand- ards and fundus camera functional standards, and (2) to demonstrate the ability of the nGoggle fundus camera to capture high-quality optical nerve images from a model eye. Successful development of this system will enable both structural and functional assessments of retinal conditions to be performed easily and inexpensively using a portable device. PROJECT NARRATIVE NGoggle Inc. proposes to develop a new wearable ophthalmic diagnostic instrument capable of performing con- current structural and functional assessment to diagnose and monitor optic neuropathies and retinal diseases. This project aims at developing a pair of compact high-resolution fundus cameras in full compliance with oph- thalmic instrument safety standards and integrating them into our neuro-monitoring nGoggle, an instrument with the demonstrated capability of estimating functional vision loss in glaucoma patients based on their electroen- cephalogram (EEG) responses evoked by visual stimuli. We also intend to demonstrate that the optic nerve images of model eyes taken by the integrated fundus cameras can yield consistent and compatible cup-to-disc ratios when compared with the measurements obtained from the same model eyes using optical coherence tomography (OCT).

"CRCNS: Resolving human face perception with novel MEG source localization methods A brief glimpse at a face quickly reveals rich multi-dimensional information about the person in front of us. How is this impressive computational feat accomplished? A recently revised neural framework for face processing suggests perception of face form information, i.e. face invariant features such as gender, age, and identity, are processed through the ventral visual pathway, comprising the occipital face area, fusiform face area, and anterior temporal lobe face area. However, evidence from fMRI remains equivocal about when, where, and how specific face dimensions of age, gender, and identity, are extracted. A key property of a complex computation is that it proceeds via stages and hence unfolds over time. We recently investigated the computational stages of face perception in a MEG study (Dobs et al., Nature Comms, 2019) and found that gender and age are extracted before identity information. However, this temporal information has yet to be linked to the spatial information available from fMRI because of limitations in current methods for spatial localization of MEG sources. Here, we propose to overcome these limitations and provide the full picture of how face computations unfold over both time and space in the brain by developing novel methods for localizing MEG sources, leveraging our team’s expertise in MEG and machine learning. In Aim 1 we will develop a new analytical MEG localization method called Alternating Projections that iteratively fits focal sources to the MEG data. In Aim 2 we will develop a novel data-driven MEG localization method based on geometric deep learning that reconstructs distributed cortical maps by learning statistical relationships in the non-Euclidean space of the cortical manifold. In Aim 3, we will first identify which method is most suitable to model human MEG face responses using fMRI face localizers as ground truth. We will then extract spatially and temporally accurate face processing maps to characterize the computational steps entailed in extracting age, gender, and identity information along the ventral visual pathway. A computationally precise characterization of the neural basis of face processing would be a landmark achievement for basic research in vision and social perception in humans. Insights into how face perception is accomplished in humans may further yield clues for how to improve AI systems conducting similar tasks. Further, the methods developed here may increase the power of MEG data to answer questions about the spatiotemporal trajectory of neural computation in the human brain. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops new brain imaging methods to improve the spatial and temporal resolution, and applies them to study visual processing of faces. The methods developed here will broaden our ability to answer questions about the spatiotemporal trajectory of neural computation in the human brain. In the field of vision, a principled understanding of the computational steps of face perception could lead to a better understanding of visual impairments.",CRCNS: Resolving human face perception with novel MEG source localization methods,10397180,R01EY033638,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Perception ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Visual Pathways ', ' Gender ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' millimeter ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' visual processing ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Familiarity ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' face perception ', ' theories ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' reconstruction ', ' Face Processing ', ' facial processing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' volunteer ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' fusiform face area ', ' operation ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' cortical mapping ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' source localization ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' deep learning ', ' statistical learning ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' implementation tool ', ' ']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,249632
"Elucidating novel features of visual processing and physiological connectivity from retina to primary visual cortex Project Summary The use of stimuli with increasingly naturalistic properties has become critical to advance our understanding of vision. Many studies demonstrate that simple artificial stimuli (e.g. sinusoidal gratings and white noise) fail to engage nonlinearities that profoundly alter responses in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and primary visual cortex (V1). A recent and striking example comes from the use of naturalistic ‘flow’ stimuli, which engage robust responses in V1 that are not predicted from responses to gratings. This gap in understanding motivates the development of a stimulus ensemble and analysis framework that produces a quantitative understanding of visual processing to increasingly naturalistic stimuli and the nonlinearities that they engage. Our objective is to understand how flow stimuli are processed from retina through visual cortex. To meet this goal, we will make neural population recordings in retina (Aims 1 & 3), LGN (Aims 1 & 3) and V1 (Aim 3) using matched experimental conditions and a unified theoretical/modeling framework to map the transformations that occur across these stages of visual processing. Our central hypothesis is that V1 transforms a discrete and heavily light-level-de- pendent retinal representation of natural stimuli into a continuous (uniform) representation that is relatively in- variant to changes in the mean luminance. This invariance places a strong constraint on the class of nonlineari- ties that transform retinal responses to those observed in LGN and V1. We test this hypothesis in three aims: (1) determine early visual processing (retina & LGN) of naturalistic flow stimuli; (2) develop an encoding manifold to capture the population activity at each processing stage and transforms from one stage to the next; (3) test the ability of the manifold description to predict the impact of light adaptation on processing flow stimuli from retina to V1. Aim 1 will yield a matched experimental dataset to an interesting and novel class of ecologically-relevant stimuli. Aim 2 will yield a quantitative framework by which to understand the transformations that occur between retina, LGN, and V1. Aim 3 will provide a platform for globally perturbing the output of the retina by switching from photopic to mesopic and scotopic conditions, and thereby compare predictions of our model to measured changes in LGN and V1 activity. The primary significance of this research is that it will provide a computationally and experimentally unified framework for understanding the transformations that occur in the processing of stim- uli across multiple stages of visual processing. The major innovations are (1) presenting visual stimuli for retinal recordings that are matched to eye movements and pupil dynamics in alert animals; (2) creating a novel analysis framework that captures the responses of neurons at all three levels and the inter-level transformations to in- creasingly complex stimuli; (3) utilizing light adaptation as a method of perturbing retinal output to test our model and the stability (invariance) of LGN and V1 responses to adapting retinal signals. The expected outcome is a data-driven model of the processing from retina to LGN and V1 that generalizes from starlight to sunlight. Project Narrative Restoring vision to the blind likely requires understanding how retinal signals are communicated to the brain and how these signals are transformed in the thalamocortical pathway. This project aims to acquire an understanding of these transformations in the context of complex and more naturalistic visual stimuli.",Elucidating novel features of visual processing and physiological connectivity from retina to primary visual cortex,10229447,R01EY031059,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Environment ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pupil ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Sunlight ', ' sun light ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Lateral Geniculate Body ', ' lateral geniculate ', ' lateral geniculate nucleus ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Stimulus ', ' luminance ', ' function luminance ', ' receptive field ', ' Light Adaptations ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' stimulus processing ', ' retinal neuron ', ' Cone ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Rod ', ' sight restoration ', ' restore sight ', ' restore vision ', ' vision restoration ', ' ']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,487568
"Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma This project will use a combination of structural and functional measurements to test the hypothesis that early- stage damage in human glaucoma occurs first in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina – especially its OFF sub-lamina – as suggested by murine glaucoma models. In the first Aim, we will use a novel visible-light optical coherence tomograph (VIS OCT) to study structural changes in the retina of glaucoma patients. The newly developed VIS OCT has sufficient image contrast and resolution to segment the IPL boundaries and to define sub-lamination in volumetric OCT data, something not currently possible with existing near-infrared OCT instruments. We will make comparative measurements within the IPL and between the IPL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Because data from mouse models of glaucoma suggests that early damage occurs preferentially within the OFF sub-lamina of the IPL, we will make separate VIS OCT measurements biased for the OFF- and ON-sublaminae of the IPL and use machine learning approaches to determine whether a similar damage process can be demonstrated in human. To test whether OFF-pathway function is preferentially lost in glaucoma, we will use a novel Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm that employs sawtooth increments and decrements to bias the measurement to ON vs OFF pathways, respectively, a paradigm our data suggests discriminates glaucoma from control patients. The second Aim will optimize this SSVEP measurement for testing localized areas of the visual field. The third Aim will make comparative measurements of visual-field, VIS OCT and SSVEP loss patterns in a large sample of glaucoma patients and in age- and sex-matched controls. Thickness and interface reflectivity amplitude maps derived from VIS OCT imaging of the RNFL, GCL and IPL including sublaminae will be correlated topographically with visual field defects to assess the relative sensitivity of our structural biomarkers at and near visual field locations with demonstrable losses on conventional (Humphrey) perimetry. Similarly, SSVEP responses from different locations in the visual field will be correlated topographically with visual field loss patterns and to VIS OCT losses, with special emphasis on correlating structural damage in OFF vs ON sub-laminae of the IPL with the functional correlates derived from regional decremental and incremental SSVEPs. Separately and in combination, our structural and functional measurements are designed to provide strong tests of the biological hypothesis that the OFF pathway is preferentially damaged in human glaucoma, and to reveal new biomarkers for the disease. Improving visual outcomes in glaucoma will require a better understanding of the earliest sites and processes of damage and methods to measure them quickly and accurately in patients. This project will address both needs through a combination of novel Optical Coherence Tomography and electrophysiological measurements. The new imaging and electrophysiological tests that will be developed here, either separately or together, could eventually replace conventional visual field testing which is time-consuming and unreliable.",Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma,10150874,R01EY030361,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Visual evoked cortical potential ', ' Visual Evoked Potentials ', ' Visual Evoked Response ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Noise ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Perimetry ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Scotoma ', ' Visual Field Disorder ', ' Visual field scotoma ', ' visual field defect ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' Visual ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Measurement ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Cellular injury ', ' cell damage ', ' cellular damage ', ' damage to cells ', ' injury to cells ', ' cell injury ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Inner Plexiform Layer ', ' Resolution ', ' Ganglion Cell Layer ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' comparative ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' RNFL ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Structural defect ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' contrast imaging ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' detection method ', ' detection procedure ', ' detection technique ', ' ']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,499625
"Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations Project Summary/Abstract The mammalian brain builds and transforms representations of the outside world through the concerted activity of populations of neurons, but the extent to which spike times or spike counts are coordinated within these ensembles beyond pairs is not clear. Models of neural encoding predict variable frequencies of spike pattern occurrence, and models of decoding delineate requirements for spike time precision within the population response. While considerable effort has been made toward the development and refinement of the theoretical basis of such neural coding schemes, and predictions have been tested against single cell and pairwise data, there has been relatively little experimental data beyond pairs able to differentiate between competing hypotheses of population coding. The proposed career development plan aims to marry large-scale electrophysiology in primary visual cortex with analysis of specific predictions derived from computational and theoretical neuroscience work for spike time coordination beyond pairwise interactions. The candidate has a deep background in in vivo experimental techniques and proposes to receive training in the high-dimensional computational techniques and to use experimental data collected to validate specific theoretical predictions. This training will establish the skills necessary for a successful independent research career studying the mechanisms of information representation and transfer in visual cortex, bridging the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience. The candidate will carry out the mentored phase under the guidance of Dr. Clay Reid, a world expert in multiple aspects of mammalian central visual processing including anatomy, physiology, and computation. Additional advising from Dr. Eric Shea- Brown and Dr. Christof Koch will provide guidance in the theoretical and applied mathematical approaches required to implement and assess advanced models of neural encoding and decoding. The training will utilize the strengths of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in collecting large-scale data and the didactic opportunities at the University of Washington. In the independent phase the candidate will use the newly acquired analytical and modeling skills in combination with his previous training in optogenetic techniques to better constrain population measurements. This work will help establish a unique independent research program to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cortical representation. Project Narrative Understanding how the brain uses population activity to build representations of the outside world is an important step towards understanding not only sensory but also psychiatric and other cognitive disorders.

"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,10312690,R44AG060857,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Clocks ', ' Biologic Clock ', ' body clock ', ' internal clock ', ' Building Codes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Moods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phototherapy ', ' Actinotherapy ', ' Light Therapy ', ' Photoradiation Therapy ', ' light treatment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retina ', ' Rotation ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' Measurement ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' meter ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' alertness ', ' Dose ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' active control ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' circadian pacemaker ', ' circadian clock ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' biological systems ', ' cloud based ', ' health data ', ' circadian ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' appropriate dose ', ' optimal drug dosage ', ' optimal drug dose ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIA,"ERIK PAGE AND ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2021,10487
"Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants. Project Summary Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) has revealed two major principles of the functional organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in human adults. First, some regions of VTC respond selectively to a specific category of stimuli, such as the fusiform face area (FFA) which responds more to faces than to any other stimulus category. The second principle of organization is that different categories of stimuli have systematically distinct patterns of response across the entire VTC. How do these two key aspects of VTC functional organization in adults arise in development? The goal of my research program is to discover if these organizing principles are present in the infant brain (Aims 1 and 2) and design computational models to test different theories of cortical development (Aim 3). The dissertation work in this proposal will provide invaluable data toward the goal of refining theories of cortical development. In addition to innovations that enhance the quality of awake infant fMRI data, Aim 1 provides the first evidence that like adults, infants have face-selective responses in the FFA, scene-selective responses in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), and body-selective responses in the extrastriate body area (EBA). Aim 2 directly follows this up by asking if infants have systematically distinct patterns of response across higher- level visual areas that are similar to those found in the adult brain. The F99 phase of this proposal will provide training to optimize machine learning (ML) techniques that can withstand the unique challenges of infant fMRI data – specifically unbalanced and missing data. The F99 phase will be conducted at MIT, an intellectual environment with access to leaders in the fields of ML, cognitive neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Finally, Aim 3 of this proposal is to build computational models designed to test current theories of cortical development. The K00 phase of this proposal will provide training on the design and implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) models as well as training on the best methods to test ANN models using infant fMRI data. Research for the K00 phase will provide a new mentorship experience with an established investigator in computational neuroscience and will take place at an institution with a thriving intellectual environment that has access to an MRI scanner and the computational resources necessary to build a variety of ANN models. In summary, the objective of the proposed research is to determine if the principles of functional organization in the adult brain are present in infants. Insights from this proposal will advance and refine theories of cortical development and have the potential to be applicable to other domains such audition and language. Further, by combining my predoctoral training in awake infant fMRI with my proposed postdoctoral training in computational modeling, the proposed research will enable me to become an independent investigator and leader in the field of computational developmental neuroscience. Project Narrative The last 20 years of cognitive neuroscience has revealed the functional architecture of the human brain with an exquisite degree of detail yet has left wide-open the question of what guides the precise development, organization, and structure of the human mind. This proposal outlines a plan to unify developmental cognitive neuroscience and computational cognitive neuroscience to uncover the starting state of the human visual system and how it develops. The proposed research stands to not only inform and refine theories of cortical development and inform our understanding of neurodevelopmental differences, but also has the potential to begin to unravel one of the most intriguing questions available to humanity: what are the origins of the human mind?",Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants.,10319402,F99NS124175,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' object recognition ', ' Categories ', ' technological innovation ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' response ', ' social cognition ', ' theories ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' model design ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' vision development ', ' visual development ', ' visual system development ', ' Population ', ' extrastriate ', ' Mind ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' pre-doc ', ' predoc ', ' predoctoral ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' fusiform face area ', ' learning community ', ' social engagement ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F99,2021,47036
"Vision in Natural Tasks Summary/Abstract  In the context of natural behavior, humans make continuous sequences of sensory-motor decisions to satisfy current behavioral goals, and vision must provide the information needed to achieve those goals. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoor environments, taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements in these contexts. Currently we have only limited understanding of the constituent tasks in natural locomotion, or the requisite information, and the proposal attempts to specify these.  in the context of natural gait, the patterns of optic flow are unexpectedly complex, raising questions about its role. The patterns of motion on the retina during locomotion depend critically on both eye and body motion, and these in turn depend on behavioral goals. Our first Aim is therefore to comprehensively describe the statistics of retinal motion patterns in a variety of terrains and task contexts. We will measure binocular eye and body movements while walking in outdoor terrains of varying roughness, crossing a busy intersection, and making coffee. These contexts will induce different gaze patterns. We will provide a comprehensive description of the motion stimulus in natural locomotion and help separate out self-motion signals from externally generated motion. These data will allow a more precise specification of the response patterns in cortical motion sensitive areas. Because of the complexity of natural motion patterns, we will re-examine the influence of optic flow on walking direction in a virtual reality environment and test alternative explanations for the role of flow.  A central task in walking is foot placement, and we will focus on identifying the image properties that make a good foothold. Stereo, structure from motion, and spatial image structure are all likely contenders. We directly investigate the role of stereo in foothold selection by examining gait patterns in stereo-deficient subjects in terrains with varying degrees of roughness. Using a different strategy, we will attempt to predict gaze locations and footholds in rough terrain using convolution neural nets (CNN’s) to identify potential search templates for footholds in rough terrain. We will describe fixation patterns from crosswalk and sidewalk navigation and attempt to make inferences about their purpose, and use Modular Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MIRL) to predict direction decisions and decompose the behavior into sub-tasks.  The collection of integrated gaze, body kinematics, and scene images in a range of natural environments is innovative, as little comparable data exists The work will be strengthened by the investigation of stereo- deficient subjects for whom there is almost no integrated eye and body data. Since much of the work in robotics has no visual input at all this should help in development of visual guidance for robots and also help better define the necessary information for individuals with impaired vision. The data set will be made publicly available. Project Narrative  The central goal of this work is to understand vision in its natural context.

"Perceptual integration of luminance, texture and color cues for visual boundary segmentation Project Summary One of the most essential computations performed by the visual system is segmenting images into regions corresponding to distinct surfaces. This in turn requires identifying the boundaries separating image regions, a process known as boundary segmentation. Computational analyses of natural images have revealed that many visual cues are available at region boundaries, including differences in luminance, texture, and color. It is known that these cues combine for tasks like edge localization and orientation discrimination. However, it remains unclear how these various cues are weighted and combined for boundary segmentation.  In collaborative work with Canadian colleagues at McGill University in Montreal, we have developed a novel machine learning framework for characterizing human performance on boundary segmentation tasks using naturalistic micro-pattern stimuli. Our method makes use of the Filter-Rectify-Filter (FRF) model often applied to characterizing texture boundary segmentation. The major innovation of our approach is that we fit the FRF model directly to thousands of psychophysical stimulus-response observations to estimate its major defining parameters. We have recently applied this approach to investigating spatial strategies for contrast boundary segmentation and comparing competing hypotheses of how contrast modulation is integrated across orientation channels. In this grant, we propose to apply both classical psychophysical techniques and our novel machine learning methodology to understanding the computations employed to combine luminance, texture and color cues for segmentation.  In Aim 1, we focus on modeling segmentation of luminance-defined boundaries, comparing the case where each surface has uniform luminance, giving rise to a sharp edge (luminance step), to the more naturalistic case where the two surfaces have differing proportions of dark and light micro-patterns on either side of the boundary with no sharp edge (luminance texture). We will apply our machine learning methodology to test the hypothesis that different neural mechanisms may be involved in segmenting these two different kinds of luminance boundaries. In Aim 2, we ask how observers integrate first-order (luminance) and second-order (texture) cues for boundary segmentation, and if there are differences in cue combination strategies for luminance steps and luminance textures. We will also compare models embodying competing hypotheses of the underlying neural mechanisms of cue combination. In Aim 3, we extend the analyses in Aims 1 and 2 beyond simple luminance differences to include differences in color. Finally, Aim 4 is a pedagogical aim of promoting undergraduate research. Project Narrative Segmenting natural images into regions corresponding to distinct surfaces is an essential visual task, yet the underlying computations for boundary segmentation remain poorly understood. In this project, we will apply classical psychophysical techniques and our novel machine learning methodology to understand how multiple cues, including luminance, texture, and color, combine to enable boundary segmentation. We hope to develop and test computational models of boundary segmentation, with the ultimate goal of gaining insight into the underlying neural mechanisms employed for this essential natural vision task.","Perceptual integration of luminance, texture and color cues for visual boundary segmentation",10201916,R15EY032732,"['Color ', ' Cues ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' luminance ', ' function luminance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Vision research ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' vision science ', ' visual science ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate research ', ' pedagogy ', ' laboratory curriculum ', ' lab curriculum ', ' laboratory course ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NEI,FLORIDA GULF COAST UNIVERSITY,R15,2021,374345
"Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sustained attention – the continuous allocation of cognitive resources to respond to infrequent but behaviorally relevant stimuli – is impaired in many psychiatric disorders and represents an important aspect of cognitive control. Sustained attention requires top-down control and engagement with the external world, which is linked to both frontoparietal and thalamic controlling signals on primary sensor cortices. Despite the extensive behavioral characterization of sustained attention in animal models using the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), very little is known about the oscillatory interaction between the dorsal attention network and thalamo-cortical dynamics and its potential as a stimulation target for enhancing sustained attention. The objective of this project is to dissect the causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic stimulation. I will focus on three regions in the visual thalamo-cortical network: higher-order visual thalamus (lateral aspect of lateral posterior nucleus, LPl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and primary visual cortex (V1). I will test the central hypothesis that LPl-cortical theta (4-7 Hz) functional connectivity causally coordinates PPC-V1 functional connectivity to facilitate sustained attention. The rationale of this work is that the proposed temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetic perturbations will directly test the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention. Accordingly, the two specific aims are: (1) Delineate the functional role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention, (2) Determine the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetics. This work is significant because it will causally test a convergent model in which higher-order visual thalamus coordinates the parietal top-down control signals onto visual cortex that is crucial for developing circuit- based therapies to enhance sustained attention. The work is innovative due to its integration of closed-loop optogenetics circuit interrogation, multisite electrophysiology, freely-moving sustained attention task, and machine-learning tools for the investigation of the causal role of oscillatory synchronization. The overall positive impact of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive map of how the higher-order visual thalamus interacts with the frontoparietal control signal to modulate V1, and thus mediates sustained attention, a transdiagnostic cognitive function that shows impairment in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The implication of this study is that it may reveal a general mechanism underlying the interaction between two higher-order processing structures signaling to lower sensory cortices during cognitive processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sustained attention enables us to focus our cognitive resources on an activity for a prolonged period of time, and when impaired causes profound deficits in both cognition and behavior. Sustained attention is modulated by the thalamo-cortical rhythms. The research generated in this proposal will investigate (1) what oscillatory feature in the higher-order thalamo-cortical circuit is crucial for sustained attention, and (2) how the temporally- precise enhancing or disrupting of a thalamo-cortical oscillatory feature alters the functional connectivity in the circuit and behavioral outcomes mediated by sustained attention.",Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention,10199754,F31MH118799,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Couples ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Ferrets ', ' Foundations ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Lateral ', ' Dorsal ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus ', ' Lateral Posterior Nucleus ', ' Lateral Posterior Thalamic Nucleus ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ', ' CaM KII ', ' CaM PK II ', ' CaM kinase II ', ' CaMKII ', ' calcium-dependent CaM kinase II ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Parietal ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Attentional deficit ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Implant ', ' cognitive control ', ' optogenetics ', ' signal processing ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' sustained attention ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2021,40048
"Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The mammalian visual cortex is critical for vision and has been used as a model for the rest of the cerebral cortex. In spite of this, little is known about the detailed operations of its microcircuits. In fact, the cortex is composed of many different cell types, and, it is likely that each cell type has a particular circuit function.  In the past cycle we focused on four major subtypes of cortical GABAergic interneurons (PV, SOM, VIP and chandeliers) in mouse visual cortex, using two- photon photoactivation and transgenic mice to map connections to and from interneurons in a systematic fashion. We found that interneurons often make synaptic connections with every single neighboring cell, and this promiscuity could be an important feature of the cortical inhibitory “circuit blueprint”.  In the course of these experiments we unexpectedly discovered that groups of coactive neurons, which we termed “neuronal ensembles”, account for the majority of the cortical response to visual stimuli. Moreover, ensembles also dominate spontaneous activity and have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Further, using two-photon optogenetics we found by chance that ensembles can be artificially imprinted into the cortex and they can be recalled by stimulating individual neurons, showing pattern completion, even days after imprinting. These intriguing results suggest that ensembles could be multicellular building blocks of cortical function, implementing a population neural code.  To pursue this discovery and test these ideas we now propose an experimental “deep dive” into the properties of these ensembles, in order to characterize their basic phenomenology, understand their synaptic circuit mechanisms and test their role in the behavior of the animal in sensory discrimination. The project will be carried out in primary visual cortex of awake behaving mice and make use of a novel two-photon holographic microscopy method that enables us to image and optically manipulate neurons in different cortical layers simultaneously.  Our work will provide a systematic anatomical and functional description of neuronal ensembles, how they regulate the activity of the cortex and how they can be manipulated and reconfigured. This could help in novel therapeutic strategies by reconfiguring pathological circuits and correct visual deficits. Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The role of coordinated neuronal activity by groups of neurons in the visual cortex is still poorly understood. In the last cycle of the grant we discovered that one can reconfigure cortical activity in mouse visual cortex using optogenetics, by imprinting and recalling artificial activity patterns, and we now propose to understand how these patterns are build and whether their manipulation can lead to changes in behavior. This work could help to understand how neural circuits in the visual cortex operate and can be altered and also help to design novel strategies to ameliorate amblyopia and cortical cerebral visual impairment by reconfiguring abnormal circuits.  ",Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex,10169447,R01EY011787,"['Amblyopia ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' In Vitro ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' nerve supply ', ' innervation ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Neocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' photoactivation ', ' sensory discrimination ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' in vivo ', ' Optical Methods ', ' Slice ', ' Pathologic ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' imprint ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' mouse genetics ', ' cortical visual impairment ', ' cerebral visual impairment ', ' ']",NEI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2021,384357
"Cortical visual processing for navigation Project summary Vision plays a key role in our ability to navigate through the environment, from identifying landmarks and obstacles to determining location and heading. While studies of visual cortex have provided an understanding of properties such as orientation selectivity and object recognition, much less is known about how cortical circuitry extracts and processes features from the visual scene to support navigation. In particular, there are two challenges. First, the nature of the visual stimulus is dramatically different in navigation, where the subject's movement through the world creates a complex and dynamic visual input, in contrast to standard synthetic stimuli presented to stationary subjects. Second, the types of visual features and computations that must be performed are different in navigation than in standard detection or discrimination paradigms. Our goal in this proposal is to determine how the brain extracts relevant visual features from the rich, dynamic visual input that typiﬁes active exploration, and investigate how the neural representation of these features can support visual navigation.  We will investigate this through three parallel aims, that build up from the representation of the visual scene in V1 during freely moving navigation, to the computation of speciﬁc variables needed for navigation. In our ﬁrst aim, we will measure the visual input in freely moving mice using miniature head-mounted cameras, together with neural activity in V1, to determine how neural dynamics represent the visual scene during natural navigation. In our second aim, we will use large ﬁeld-of-view two-photon imaging of multiple cortical areas, while mice navigate in a naturalistic open-world virtual reality system, to determine how visual features are represented across visual cortical areas. In our third aim, we will use 2-photon imaging in mice in a rotational arena to determine how visual input is used to dynamically update a key navigational variable: heading direction.

"Guiding Attention in Real-World Scenes Project Summary Real-world scenes contain far more information than we can perceive at any given moment. Scene perception therefore requires attentional selection of relevant scene regions for prioritized processing. How are those aspects of the world that should receive priority selected? Although much past research has focused on how attention is guided by the visual properties of a scene, new evidence from meaning maps, developed in the previous funding period, established that the distribution of meaning across a scene plays a central and often dominant role in guiding attention. This surprising finding raises many important new questions about the nature of scene meaning and its specific role in attentional guidance. The overarching goal of this project is to understand in detail how the semantic features of a scene’s objects and functional spaces influence the guidance of visual attention in complex real-world scenes. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the role of object semantics in attentional guidance in scenes; (2) To determine the role of functional spaces in attentional guidance in scenes; (3) To determine how viewing task interacts with scene semantics in guiding attention. The project is innovative in expanding the traditional study of attention to explicitly consider the role of meaning. To this end, new semantic maps capitalizing on the meaning map concept will be used capture local region meaning continuously over a scene, allowing for direct investigation of the relationships of different types of meaning with attention. The project is innovative in (1) expanding the traditional study of visual attention to explicitly consider the role of semantics; (2) focusing on the semantics of both scene content (objects) and scene structure (space); (3) considering the role of meaning in attentional guidance in the context of viewing task; (4) integrating the use of a wide variety of cognitive science methods marshalled in the service of understanding the influence of meaning on visual attention in real-world scenes, including eyetracking, large-scale crowd-sourcing, computational image processing, computational semantic modeling, and deep convolutional neural networks. The project is significant in challenging current models of visual attention to account for the role of scene meaning. Because the proposed studies test competing models, the results will lead to the development of integrative theoretical frameworks that advance the field regardless of the outcome. While focused on basic science, the studies have potentially important translational implications by providing a more complete characterization of the processes associated with visual attention. The proposed studies may ultimately lead to the development of rehabilitation strategies for visual attention as it operates in the real world, better capitalizing on the use of a viewer’s knowledge to offset disrupted functions in those with attention and vision deficits. Project Narrative The visual world presents us with far more information than we can process at any given moment. How does the brain select those aspects of the world that should receive priority for visual analysis? This project investigates how we select and attend to meaningful information the natural environment given what we are currently trying to accomplish. The studies combine high-resolution eyetracking with models of meaning based on crowd-sourced human ratings, computer vision models of image processing, deep learning models of scene recognition and attention, and hybrid artificial intelligence models of complex concepts. The role of meaning in guiding attention is contrasted with the role of pre-semantic image features. The knowledge gained will increase our theoretical understanding of how visual attention and perception operate in complex meaningful scenes, assist in the identification of individuals with deficits in visual attention, and may ultimately lead to the development of targeted rehabilitation strategies for the real world.",Guiding Attention in Real-World Scenes,10250349,R01EY027792,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Environment ', ' Esthetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Evaluation ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Marshal ', ' Services ', ' Visual attention ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' visual search ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' visual information ', ' concept mapping ', ' concept maps ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging properties ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,369421
"Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure PROJECT SUMMARY Modern technology makes it possible to capture a visual scene as a photograph, alter it, send it to another country nearly instantaneously, and store it without concern for degradation. None of this is currently possible in olfaction. Although perfumers and flavorists are adept at mixing odorous molecules to produce a desired perceptual effect, the rules underlying this process are poorly understood at a quantitative level. Current methods for displaying odors to a subject are akin to requiring a Polaroid of every visual stimulus of interest. A more efficient method for probing the olfactory system would be to use a set of 'primary odors'—some limited number of odors from which all other complex odors could be reproduced by appropriate mixtures. Both auditory and visual stimuli have been digitized, and this will eventually be possible in olfaction as well. Predicting odor from chemical structure has been a problem in the field since its inception, but recent advances in machine learning algorithms have made great progress in analogous problems, such as facial recognition. The research proposed here will combine these machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to understand how to predict the smell of a molecule or mixture of odorants, which will ultimately help improve our understanding of disease diagnosis using odors as well as eating-related health and illness. HEALTH RELEVANCE The sense of smell plays a critical role in preferences and aversions for specific foods. The proposed research will combine machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to create a model that can predict the smell of odorous molecules. This model will allow us to describe and control odors, which will increase our understanding of food preference and eating-related health and wellness.",Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure,10249061,R01DC017757,"['Algorithms ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Preferences ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ligands ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' GC MS ', ' GCMS ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Odors ', ' Olfactory Pathways ', ' Olfactory system ', ' olfactory circuitry ', ' olfactory circuits ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell ', ' odor perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' physical property ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' single molecule ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Numerical value ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computer monitor ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' high dimensionality ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,R01,2021,437424
"Towards a computationally precise characterization of the human ventral visual pathway Project Summary/Abstract: Humans are extraordinarily visual animals, allocating a third of their cortex just to seeing what is in front of them. Visual recognition is supported by a series of hierarchically organized brain regions known collectively as the ventral visual cortex (VVC). Despite extensive research, we still lack a computationally precise understanding of how visual information is represented and transformed over stages of the human VVC. A key barrier has been the limitations of methods like functional MRI (fMRI) which make it difficult to test a large number of experimental stimuli. The research in this proposal will overcome this barrier by collecting fMRI responses to hundreds of stimuli, and analyzing these data using deep neural network based computational models and human interpretable algorithms such as image-synthesis and saliency mapping. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will focus on the category-selective regions of the VVC, that respond preferentially to images of faces (fusiform face area), scenes (parahippocampal place area), and bodies (extrastriate body area). I will develop and use new computational methods together with closed-loop experiments to address open questions such as: Is the hypothesized selectivity for these regions even correct? What is represented in the intermediate stages of processing? Are there functionally distinct regions within the category-selective regions? In Aim 2 (R00 phase), I will venture into the ~65% of VVC that lies outside the category-selective regions. I will develop and apply new data-driven clustering to divide these regions into their native components, and characterize them individually. Together, this endeavor will reveal the computational and neural basis of visual recognition in humans with an unprecedented precision. My background in experimental and analytical methods in monkey and human vision puts me in a unique position to accomplish this proposal which requires a seamless integration between neuroimaging experiments and state-of-the-art computational modeling. The proposed work will be initiated in the lab of Prof. Nancy Kanwisher (mentor). During the K99 phase, I will continue to be mentored by Prof. Kanwisher, and will also advance my expertise with computational modeling under the supervision of Dr. Jim DiCarlo (co-mentor), and ultra-high-resolution 7T neuroimaging with Dr. Jon Polimeni (collaborator). This proposed plan will significantly augment my theoretical understanding and experimental abilities, and put me on a path to independence. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance Statement How the collective action of distributed neural systems in the human visual pathway leads to our rich percept of the visual world is not well understood, and disorders of the circuits involved in perception, especially those involved in face and object recognition, can significantly impair normal social function. Understanding the neural computations that support human vision and their locations in the brain will offer valuable insights into the development of visual neuro-prostheses, guidance for neurosurgery, and strategies for recovery from brain damage.",Towards a computationally precise characterization of the human ventral visual pathway,10191834,K99EY032603,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Perception ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Pathways ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Work ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' data quality ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' visual processing ', ' Performance ', ' visual stimulus ', ' object recognition ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-prosthetic ', ' neuroprosthetic ', ' neuroprosthesis ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Categories ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Social Functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' vision development ', ' visual development ', ' visual system development ', ' Population ', ' extrastriate ', ' Impairment ', ' Network-based ', ' ultra high resolution ', ' visual information ', ' fusiform face area ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' cognitive ability ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2021,110175
"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",10173765,U24EB029011,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Phenotype ', ' Programming Languages ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Licensing ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Funding ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' reconstructive surgery ', ' Reconstructive Surgical Procedures ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Normalities ', ' Normalcy ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' medical implant ', ' reconstruction ', ' shape analysis ', ' shape description ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' interoperability ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' commercialization ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' clinical investigation ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2021,320290
