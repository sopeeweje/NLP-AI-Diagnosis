"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) Summary: Overall section Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). In a recently published report, Simmons-Mackie (1) estimates that over two million people in North America are currently living with aphasia. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, the incidence of stroke in younger individuals has been steadily increasing (2). In fact, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina are under the age of 60 (2). Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others’ speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified as the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems and never fully recover. To address the need for studies improving long-term outcomes in aphasia, the Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR), funded for just under four years at the time of this application, has made great progress towards understanding the mechanisms that promote spontaneous and therapy-induced recovery in aphasia. The overarching goal of the research proposed in this renewal application is to maintain our focus on aphasia therapy. Specifically, during the next funding phase, the focus of C-STAR is to improve access to aphasia therapy, enhance the effect of behavioral aphasia therapy to promote an improved aphasia therapy outcome, and understand overall health and neurolinguistic factors that influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will continue to rely on collaboration among five main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Leonardo Bonilha, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will continue to focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects have proven successful in yielding a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia therapy. Relying on this dataset, Bonilha and Rorden’s project will focus on the relationship between brain health and recovery from aphasia, whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to aphasia therapy success as well as new neurolinguistic models of speech and language processing. Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by expanding access to therapy by using telerehabilitation and by understanding the effects of drug therapy, brain health, and neurolinguistic factors on the outcome of aphasia therapy.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),10094377,P50DC014664,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Anodes ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Biography ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Data Collection ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Maps ', ' Persons ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' North America ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' South Carolina ', ' Speech ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' brain tissue ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' success ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Manuscripts ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Escitalopram ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' therapy outcome ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' double-blind placebo controlled trial ', ' double-masked controlled trial ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' chronic stroke ', ' speech processing ', ' language processing ', ' telerehabilitation ', ' telerehab ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' Double-blind trial ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' recovery in aphasia ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' brain health ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke incidence ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke-induced aphasia ', ' aphasia due to stroke ', ' aphasia following stroke ', ' poststroke aphasia ', ' stroke aphasia ', ' stroke survivor with aphasia ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Phase I/II Clinical Trial ', ' Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2021,2802945
"Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke and has no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hematoma expansion (HE), interval growth of the hematoma, is a proximate cause of worse patient outcomes and death as larger hematomas displace brain tissue; hematomas > 60 mL reliably lead to disability or death at follow-up. Preventing HE is a promising strategy to improve outcomes for patients with ICH. Our relative inability to predict HE, however, has impeded the development of effective treatment strategies for ICH, and several clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Even when HE has been reduced, our ability to detect a benefit is hampered by relatively insensitive patient outcomes. This proposal will resolve two roadblocks that prevent the development of effective treatments for ICH, the most morbid form of stroke. Three comprehensive stroke centers (two from the Northwestern Medicine system in metropolitan Chicago, IL, and the University of Texas at Houston) will partner to prospectively enroll patients with ICH, measure hemostasis, measure HE, and record patient outcomes with state of the art assessments, including the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and NIH Toolbox. First, we will determine the mechanisms that lead to HE in acute ICH, broadly grouped into platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Each can be specifically measured and has specific treatments to improve it. For example, reduced platelet activity due to aspirin can be reliably improved with desmopressin, delayed activation of coagulation may be related to hypomagnesemia, and accelerated fibrinolysis may be reduced with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Each will be examined for predicting HE; if multiple pathways are found, we will determine which are most important with machine learning. Once the most important mechanisms of hemostasis for HE are determined, we will explore if specific therapies improve platelet activity. It is possible that specific treatments for specific deficits in hemostasis will be more likely to reduce HE than single therapies applied to ICH patients generally (e.g., Factor VII). Once hemostatic mechanisms of HE are determine, we will determine the effect of HE on patient outcomes such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a global ordinal scale), PROMIS, and NIH Toolbox. This will be crucial to plan for future clinical trials intended to improve patient outcomes through correcting abnormal hemostasis in acute ICH. Results will apply broadly to other bleeding conditions (e.g., neurotrauma). PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke. Hematoma expansion is a proximate cause of worse outcome after ICH, yet our ability to predict HE is limited. This proposal will determine how platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis predict HE, and how HE, in turn, affect patient outcomes.","Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage",10133760,R01NS110779,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aminocaproic Acids ', ' Antifibrinolytic Agents ', ' Antifibrinolysins ', ' Antifibrinolytics ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Desmopressin ', ' 1-Desamino-8-arginine Vasopressin ', ' Deamino Arginine Vasopressin ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Eptacog Alfa ', ' Factor VII ', ' Proconvertin ', ' Serum Prothrombin Conversion Accelerator ', ' Stable Factor ', ' autoprothrombin I ', ' cothromboplastin ', ' Factor VIIa ', ' Activated Blood Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Activated Factor VII ', ' Coagulation Factor VIIa ', ' Fibrinolysis ', ' Fibrinolyses ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hematoma ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Texas ', ' Thrombelastography ', ' Thromboelastography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Tranexamic Acid ', ' AMCA ', ' AMCHA ', ' t-AMCHA ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Universities ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' clopidogrel ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Platelet Transfusion ', ' Blood Platelet Transfusion ', ' Plts ', ' Hypomagnesemia ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Survivors ', ' disability ', ' Intuition ', ' Measurement ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' brain tissue ', ' American ', ' metropolitan ', ' Reporting ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' improved outcome ', ' stroke trials ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,609173
"Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is, functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies, we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two complementary cohorts of patients—acute and chronic—longitudinally using the same multimodal functional and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent, as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia. Project Narrative Aphasia (acquired language impairment) is one of the most common consequences of stroke and often leads to significant long-term disability. This project seeks to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes.

"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools. These brain-behavior correlations will generate fundamental knowledge about stroke recovery to inform new interventions that can reduce the burden of disability caused by stroke.",Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery,10237248,K08NS109315,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Calcium ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Control Groups ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Forelimb ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Publishing ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' neurological rehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' neurological rehab ', ' neurorehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' joint mobility ', ' joint movement ', ' joint mobilization ', ' meetings ', ' brain cell ', ' experience ', ' sensory cortex ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' career development ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' rehabilitation research ', ' rehab research ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' stroke recovery ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' brain behavior ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' disability burden ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' motor recovery ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' imaging study ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2021,213840
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations.

"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol.

In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations. Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,10124424,R01HL137734,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Transient Ischemic Attack ', ' Brain TIA ', ' mini stroke ', ' mini-stroke ', ' Communication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fingers ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Market Research ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Patient Representative ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' heart rhythm ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Letters ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' usability ', ' iterative design ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' noninvasive monitor ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' high risk ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' screening ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' signal processing ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' stroke survivor ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' stroke patient ', ' cryptogenic stroke ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,731023
"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke. The generated measurement tools will facilitate important stroke recovery research, which is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability.",Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke,10240277,K02NS104207,"['Animals ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Dyskinetic syndrome ', ' Abnormal Movements ', ' Dyskinesias ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Standardization ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' neurological rehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' neurological rehab ', ' neurorehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' user-friendly ', ' stem ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' clinical practice ', ' motor recovery ', ' Data Science ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke model ', ' stroke outcome ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K02,2021,228159
"DISCOVERY: Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY Stroke is the major cause of an adult disability epidemic in the US, with a major contribution from post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID), the rates of which are disproportionally high among the health disparity populations. Despite the PSCID’s overwhelming impact on public health, a knowledge gap exists with regard to the complex interaction between the acute stroke event and highly prevalent pre-existing brain pathology related to cerebrovascular (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease, or related dementia (AD/ADRD). Understanding the factors that modulate PSCID risk in relation to index stroke event is critically important for developing personalized prognostication of PSCID, targeted interventions to prevent PSCID, and informing future clinical trial design. In response to this critical challenge, we propose Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on RecoverY (DISCOVERY), a collaborative network of clinical sites with access to acute stroke populations and the expertise and capacity for systematic assessment of PSCID led by a team of recognized experts in VCID, AD, acute stroke, health disparities, and multi-center research. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine which specific subsets of stroke events cause (or do not cause) PSCID and which additional demographic (sex, race, ethnicity), clinical factors and comorbidities that synergize with acute stroke to result in or prevent PSCID. The overall scientific objective of this study is to elucidate mechanisms of brain resilience/susceptibility to PSCID in diverse US populations based on complex interplay between life-course exposure to multiple vascular risk factors, pre-existing burden of microvascular and neurodegenerative pathology, the effect of strategic acute stroke lesions, and the mediating effect of genomic/epigenomic variation. We will achieve this goal by implementing the DISCOVERY Network of 30 clinical sites, which under the leadership of the Administrative Core and guided by the research strategy delineated by the Recruitment and Retention, Statistics, and Repository Cores, will conduct a prospective, multi- center, observational, nested-cohort study of 8,000 nondemented ischemic and hemorrhagic incident stroke patients within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, with serial cognitive evaluations and assessments of functional outcome, with subsets undergoing research MRI and PET and comprehensive genetic/genomic and fluid biomarker testing. In a series of systematic, hypothesis driven experiments we will: 1) identify the independent and combined effect of the acute stroke lesion, pre-existing burden of disease, and baseline markers of brain resilience on PSCID; 2) examine the role of acute stroke as a critical factor in accelerating AD/ADRD and VCID pathology leading to PSCID; and 3) develop two distinct generalizable personalized-medicine models for individual patient outcome prediction and patient selection for clinical trials. DISCOVERY will become a landmark study to unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early stroke recovery, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation. Stroke-related disability - including cognitive impairment and dementia - is a public health epidemic and a key national research priority in the United States. Because of its disproportionately high impact on health disparity populations, understanding the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive decline is a matter of equitable health care delivery. DISCOVERY, the proposed collaborative nationwide network of clinical sites with access to diverse acute stroke US populations has the expertise, experience and capacity to execute a large prospective study that will unravel the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disability, early recovery after stroke, and potential targets for personalized prevention, intervention, and

"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,10239050,R01DC014960,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diffusion ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Speech ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Structure ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' healing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' stroke recovery ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' support network ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' recovery in aphasia ', ' language impairment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' study population ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' recruit ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,721339
"Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis ABSTRACT Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke worldwide. Despite intensive medical management, the current standard of care for secondary stroke prevention, the rate of recurrent stroke is 13% in the first year and as high as 35% in certain populations by 2 years. Currently, the initial and follow-up evaluations of these patients rely exclusively on assessments of clinical risk factors and, in some circumstances, the degree of luminal stenosis on imaging. However, this strategy may overlook subtle non-luminal changes within ICAD lesions. A tool that can directly probe atherosclerotic plaques and accurately quantify longitudinal changes of plaque features may help early identify non-responsive patients in whom an alternative therapy can be initiated. Magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging (VWI) has the potential to fulfill this role because of its compacity to directly visualize the vessel wall and characterize plaque features. However, there are several technical challenges associated with intracranial VWI: small size, tortuous course, and deep sitting warrant a high-resolution and 3D imaging approach; multiple lesion sites require a large imaging view; signals arising from neighboring blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to be adequately suppressed; relatively long imaging time and potential image corruption by patient motion; and lack of dedicated plaque analysis tools particularly for 3D dataset. In this proposal, we will develop a reliable 3D VWI- based MR plaque imaging (MRPI) strategy for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD. Specifically, we will first develop a whole-brain 3D VWI sequence with intracranial vessel-dedicated motion compensation and motion-adaptive imaging acceleration (Aim1-Task1) and develop an automated intracranial vessel wall (IVA) tool integrating 3D vessel wall segmentation and computational algorithms for deriving quantitative plaque features (Aim1-Task2) followed by a validation study (Aim1-Task3). The validated techniques will then be used in a cross-sectional study to determine the MRPI-derived quantitative plaque features that are associated with ICAD lesions within the infarcted territory in patients with acute symptomatic ICAD (Aim 2). We will finally conduct a longitudinal study to determine the capacity of longitudinal and quantitative MRPI to predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients (Aim 3). Successful completion of the project will validate the compacity of VWI-based MRPI to quantitatively characterize ICAD and predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients. This will open the door to future clinical trials investigating the role of MRPI in developing personalized management paradigms and assessing new therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atherosclerosis in the brain is an important cause of ischemic stroke worldwide and carries a high risk of recurrent stroke despite treatment.

"Data Harmonization PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the fifth most prevalent cause of death in the U.S. afflicting nearly 800,000 per year. About three quarters of strokes are first events, underscoring the importance of primary prevention. Designing optimal preventive strategies requires identification of risk factors and estimation of the risk of stroke. The most recent American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association Guidelines for the Primary Prevention of Stroke conclude that “an ideal stroke risk assessment tool that is simple, is widely applicable and accepted, and takes into account the effects of multiple risk factors does not exist.” One of the most commonly recommended predictive models is the Framingham Stroke Profile, developed and updated more than 25 years ago. Newer models have been proposed (including the Self-Reported Stroke Risk Stratification tool from the REGARDS study) but have not been thoroughly validated. Consequently, the Primary Prevention of Stroke guidelines call for more research “to validate risk assessment tools across age, sex, and race/ethnic groups” and “to evaluate whether any of the more recently identified risk factors add to the predictive accuracy of existing scales”. We propose to address these gaps by aggregating and harmonizing existing patient-level data collected as part of longitudinal cohort studies supported by the NINDS and NHLBI. The data will be obtained through a partnership with the coordinating center for the REGARDS Study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and by a request submitted to the NIH dbGap repository to obtain data from the Framingham Offspring, ARIC and MESA cohorts. At the same time, we will expand the advanced machine learning techniques developed as part of our currently funded NIH BD2K award to Duke. We will apply these models to the harmonized data to facilitate development and validation of prediction tool for primary strokes. These complex analyses will require advanced computational resources that will utilize the AHA's Precision Medicine Platform (PMP), built based on Amazon Web Services.

"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients ABSTRACT Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. The goal of acute ischemic stroke therapy is to salvage tissue that is at risk of infarction, but still viable, through the use of reperfusion strategies. Current reperfusion therapies are limited by a tight time window for treatment and by the potential risk of brain hemorrhage. Using this time-based approach, only a limited number of stroke patients are eligible for treatment. Patients who present beyond the standard treatment time windows can benefit from therapy when identified based on multimodal MRI; however, precise and accurate identification of the salvageable tissue is essential, as the potential beneficial effect of treatment must be weighed against the risk of hemorrhage. Although a diffusion/perfusion MRI mismatch has been suggested as a guide with which to identify the presence of salvageable tissues and to serve as a selection marker for thrombolysis, the results of clinical trials using this criterion have been inconclusive, in part because of the inclusion of regions of oligemia in the penumbra, which overestimates the size of the tissue at risk. Amide proton transfer (APT) MRI has shown promise in detecting such an acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in animal models and in human stroke patients. However, most currently used APT imaging protocols are not very practical and not optimized with respect to the magnitude of signal changes caused by the pH effect. More quantitative APT-MRI typically would require an even longer scan time due to the use of multiple RF saturation frequencies, multiple acquisitions, and a long RF saturation pulse (or pulse train), all of which hamper clinical translation due to the very small time-window between stroke onset and possible thrombolysis treatment. Our long-term goal is to develop an ultrafast pH imaging technique for routine clinical use to guide reperfusion therapies for hyperacute stroke patients at various therapeutic time windows, as well as predict the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) following acute ischemic stroke. The first clinical hypothesis is that, similar to animal studies, the pH imaging penumbra due to ischemic tissue acidosis predicts the maximum final infarction size if no reperfusion is initiated. Our second clinical hypothesis is that the presence of severe tissue acidosis in the ischemic core is associated with an increased probability of secondary HT. Our hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims: 1) to develop and optimize an ultrafast quantitative pH imaging method; 2) to validate this technique and assess the diagnostic accuracy of the acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in a clinical setting; and 3) to develop a novel deep-learning model with which to predict HT following acute ischemic stroke, and quantify the sensitivity and specificity of pH imaging. This work is expected to accelerate the translation of APT-MRI into a clinically viable and robust method. The addition of pH imaging to the standard MRI protocol is expected to enable better visualization of the true ischemic penumbra, thus improving predictions of clinical outcome and reducing the incidence of HT. NARRATIVE This research proposal is designed to optimize the speed and evaluate the accuracy of a novel pH MRI technique for identifying stroke patients with salvageable brain regions, as well as patients at increased risk for developing hemorrhage after an acute ischemic stroke. The results would enhance patient selection for treatment, extend the therapeutic time window, and improve the risk-benefit ratio of recanalization therapies.",Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients,10102290,R01NS112242,"['Acidosis ', ' Amides ', ' Animals ', ' Anaerobic Bacteria ', ' anaerobe ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diffusion ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Alteplase ', ' Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' T-Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Activator D-44 ', ' Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator ', ' t-PA ', ' Probability ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Reperfusion Therapy ', ' reperfusion ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Intravenous ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Frequencies ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' thrombolysis ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Modeling ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Symptoms ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Ischemic Penumbra ', ' treatment effect ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' risk benefit ratio ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' human imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' stroke patient ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' blood-brain barrier permeabilization ', ' BBB permeabilization ', ' BBB permeable ', ' blood-brain barrier permeable ', ' bloodbrain barrier permeabilization ', ' bloodbrain barrier permeable ', ' detection sensitivity ', ' endovascular thrombectomy ', ' ']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,384813
"Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device Project Summary: Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are common causes of death and permanent disability worldwide, costing the U.S. health system more than $71 billion per year in lost productivity and medical expenses. Existing paradigms for stroke/TBI diagnosis require computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to classify ischemic versus hemorrhagic variants prior to intervention, as treatment for these conditions varies widely. Delays in diagnosis and issues related to transport of unstable patients associated with diagnostic imaging increase the likelihood of neurological injury and death. Translational medical devices that accelerate time-to-treatment in the field or hospital setting may help to reduce morbidity and mortality in stroke/TBI patients on a global level. Our team has developed a portable, rapid and noninvasive imaging and detection device based on eddy current damping (ECD) sensors that can detect brain hemorrhages associated with stroke and TBI, and have demonstrated feasibility in a benchtop, human cadaver and clinical patient setting. This device can potentially diagnose and classify hemorrhagic stroke/TBI subtypes with accurate spatial localization in minutes, rather than hours, thereby guiding early responders and medical providers in making time-sensitive medical decisions for clinical intervention, such as administration of tissue plasminogen activator for ischemic stroke. Our overall goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel stroke detection device in rapidly triaging stroke/TBI patients and achieving a level of diagnostic accuracy capable of guiding clinical intervention. We hypothesize that: 1) Regional conductivity changes in brain tissue can be imaged and detected using the portable ECD sensor; 2) Hemorrhagic stroke and TBI-related hemorrhages will increase regional conductivity, whereas ischemic stroke will decrease dependent brain conductivity in affected ischemic regions; and 3) Portable stroke imaging may reduce time-to-treatment and diagnosis associated with stroke/TBI. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) Perform benchtop laboratory experiments to further elucidate how direction and magnitude of measured conductivity changes can differentiate stroke subtype and location, 2) Use validated human cadaver stroke simulation models to optimize ECD tri-coil array sensor detection of hemorrhage depth, volume, and location, 3) Utilize machine learning algorithms to quickly classify brain lesions with high accuracy, and 4) Implement early clinical stroke/TBI ECD sensor device testing to gauge effectiveness in live human patients, compared to CT/MR imaging. Development of methods for rapid bedside stroke/TBI diagnosis will provide practitioners with knowledge required to rapidly administer life-saving treatments, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this will help to reduce time-to-treatment and guide triage and intervention, which is likely to translate to improved morbidity and mortality associated with these common conditions. Project Narrative Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are leading causes of major disability and death, and delays in diagnosis and treatment are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Current diagnostic standards in stroke and TBI require that patients undergo computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in a hospital setting to differentiate ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes before initiating treatment. Our study proposes to develop a portable, noninvasive stroke/TBI detection and imaging system based on tri-coil eddy current damping technology, thereby rapidly identifying stroke subtypes, accelerating time-to-treatment, and providing early responders with information necessary to more efficiently administer triaged and appropriate intervention in the field or acute care setting.",Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device,10100064,R01NS119596,"['Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cadaver ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Coma ', ' Comatose ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gelatin ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Morbidity -

"Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects about 10% of older adults and accounts for a growing proportion of strokes. Lifelong oral anticoagulation, with warfarin or a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), is recommended for stroke prevention in most AF patients. However, the drugs increase the risk of bleeding and the adherence to the lifelong drug therapy is poor, leaving many patients under-treated. The recently-approved Watchman device offers an attractive alternative to lifelong drug therapy for AF stroke prevention. However, the device has been studied in only two clinical trials, both of which compared it to warfarin. Little is known about how Watchman compares with the current mainstay therapy, NOACs, or how Watchman compares with no treatment in patients who have difficulties taking anticoagulation drugs. Furthermore, for preventive treatment with a high upfront cost and some procedural risks, a personalized approach is needed to target Watchman to patients who are most likely to benefit and avoid it in those who have little to gain. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to address these evidence gaps and develop new prediction tools to optimize the use of Watchman for AF stroke prevention. In Aim 1, we will conduct comparative effectiveness studies using a large national administrative database (OptumLabs) that contains insurance claims for over two million patients with AF of all ages and races from all 50 states with linked EHRs in a subset. The findings will provide timely evidence to address the key unanswered questions highlighted in current practice guidelines and will facilitate the design, analysis, and interpretation of future clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate machine-learning models to predict how Watchman compares with non-invasive therapies. We will develop the models using the OptumLabs data, and validate the models in two RCTs and two large health systems’ EHRs, thereby validating models in both clinical trial and routine practice settings. The new prediction models will provide personalized estimates for the benefits and harms, and thus, engage patients in making informed choices consistent with their preferences and ease clinicians’ cognitive burden. In Aim 3, we will assess how the Watchman decisions made in contemporary practice agree with those suggested by the new prediction models. We will use machine-learning methods to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with incongruent decisions. Such findings will highlight patient and provider groups who may particularly benefit from the decision support, thereby informing future implementation and translation efforts. We have assembled a team with complementary clinical and research expertise, a solid record of successful collaboration, and extensive experience in outcomes research and prediction modeling. We also have developed a web-based decision aid that is ready to translate the prediction models to reduce unwarranted variation in care delivery, patient outcomes, and medical costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The findings will provide timely evidence to bridge the gaps between clinical trials and everyday practice. The new prediction models, once embedded in a decision aid, will bring personalized outcome estimates to shared decision making to promote evidence-based and patient-centered care. Therefore, the proposed project has great potentials to improve the care for millions of patients with AF at risk for stroke.",Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device,10074511,R01AG062436,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Judgment ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Suggestion ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Warfarin ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' Risk-Benefit Assessment ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' evidence base ', ' routine practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' cognitive load ', ' cognitive burden ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' insurance claims ', ' practice setting ', ' preservation ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,493168
"Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging Project Summary Every four minutes an American dies from stroke, equating to approximately 1 in every 19 US deaths annually. Strokes are classiﬁed as ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes make up 87% of all strokes and are caused by a blockage in a blood vessel (or artery) resulting in a lack of blood to the brain. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery in the brain leaks or ruptures releasing excess blood in or around the brain. Incorrect classiﬁcation can have dire consequences as treating a patient suffering from a hemorrhagic stroke (bleed) with anticoagulant drugs (used to dissolve blood clots for ischemic strokes) can prove fatal. Early action is of the utmost importance as each passing minute that brain cells lack the proper blood ﬂow additional cells die. Current classiﬁcation methods require tests performed at the hospital, e.g., CT or MRI scans of the patient's brain, leading to treatment delays. These delays are particularly lengthy for patients living in rural communities.  Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that is inexpensive, has no ionizing radiation, and provides portable high-contrast images using harmless surface current and voltage measurements (e.g., on the head using a ﬂexible hat) to recover the internal point-wise electrical properties (e.g., inside the brain). EIT can recover conductivity, a measure of how easily current ﬂows through a material, as well as permittivity, a measure of the ability of a material to store a charge. A hemorrhagic stroke corresponds to an area of abnormally high conductivity due to the bleed, whereas an ischemic stroke presents as an area of lower conductivity than expected due cellular swelling from energy failure.  The proposed project addresses the important problem of early, fast, portable stroke classiﬁcation with EIT. A critical barrier for the use of EIT for stroke imaging has been the sensitivity of the image reconstruction algorithms to incorrect domain modeling and noise in the data. Due to these challenges, most research has focused on monitoring applications, not helpful for the classiﬁcation task. By contrast, the D-bar reconstruction method proposed here is the only proven noise and modeling error robust reconstruction method capable of recovering the true conductivity/permittivity using a low-pass ﬁltering in a nonlinear Fourier domain. D-bar methods have been successful in 2D but their development in 3D is stunted. This proposal focuses on the development of fast, robust D-bar based reconstruction methods for the 3D partial boundary problem, critical to working with stroke EIT data. Numerical algorithms will be developed for the full and partial boundary problems in 3D and validated on simulated and experimental data. A priori information, from anatomical atlases, will be embedded into the methods for increased resolution and stability. As the low-pass ﬁltering in D-bar methods leads to blurred reconstructions, post-processing through Convolutional Neural Networks will provide improved image quality. This work will be the ﬁrst to develop robust computational algorithms for 3D EIT data, opening the door for stroke imaging. Project Narrative Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), a portable imaging modality may provide early classiﬁcation of stroke type reducing treatment delays thus leading to improved patient outcomes. Existing image reconstruction algorithms for EIT are not robust to practical partial boundary data inherent to stroke imaging. Robust D-bar methods, aided with a priori information from anatomical atlases, will be developed in 3D to address the stroke classiﬁcation and monitoring tasks from practical EIT data.",Direct 3D Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography for Stroke Imaging,10064622,R21EB028064,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Ambulances ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Arteries ', ' Atlases ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Charge ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electric Conductivity ', ' Electrical Conductivity ', ' electrical conductance ', ' Electrodes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Noise ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Alteplase ', ' Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' T-Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Activator D-44 ', ' Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator ', ' t-PA ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Swelling ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Rural Community ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Benign ', ' Chemicals ', ' Failure ', ' Blood flow ', ' Measurement ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Fourier Transform ', ' Hour ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' American ', ' brain cell ', ' electrical property ', ' voltage ', ' Devices ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' portability ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' cancer classification ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' Rupture ', ' Outcome ', ' Cancerous ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' tumor ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Geometry ', ' mathematical methods ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' contrast imaging ', ' stroke patient ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' electrical impedance tomography ', ' ']",NIBIB,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,225052
"Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers The proposed study will be based on a multimodal approach using 4D flow MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and high-resolution vessel wall imaging (VWI) together with patient information (demographics and clinical factors) to predict the risk of recurrent stroke of patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) stenosis. This will allow integrating the vulnerability of the stenosis as well as the patient by assessing the hemodynamic impact, plaque stability, and stroke lesion pattern together with patient information into a prediction model. PWI will provide tissue perfusion, VWI will provide plaque stability, DWI will provide stroke lesion pattern and 4D flow MRI will provide macroscopic hemodynamics of the circle of Willis (CoW). We will concentrate on the following innovative developments: 4D flow MRI: In order to allow 4D flow MRI scanning with a high dynamic velocity range (necessary to measure slow and fast velocities simultaneously), we recently developed dual-venc 4D flow MRI. However, this method suffers from extended scan tome of an already long acquisition. We, therefore, aim to minimize scan time for dual-venc 4D flow MRI scan while using the required spatial resolution and volume coverage, targeting 5-10 minutes so that this sequence can be added to clinical protocols. We aim to achieve this by integrating compressed sensing acceleration. Rigorous testing of the sequence will be done in phantom experiments as well as in a healthy test-retest control study. Data Analysis and Outcome Prediction: Currently, the multi-modal information that can be acquired with MRI has not been combined and used for comprehensive prediction of recurrent stroke risk in ICAD. Information that can be acquired from different MRI modalities may be critical in characterizing ICAD patient status. We will develop a new analysis tool that combines all data into a single network graph. All imaging data will be reported relative to supplying the intracranial artery of the CoW by using the vascular territory region of interest analysis. This will allow gathering all imaging parameters in a network graph. In a cross-sectional patient study, we will use combined data to see if it enables differentiation between healthy subjects, ICAD subgroups. Patient Study: In Aim 3, we will develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict which of the patients are at risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. In order to achieve this, we will enroll a total of 150 ICAD patients from two institutions (Northwestern Memorial Hospital and San Francisco General Hospital). The combined data from the four different MR modalities and all other patient information will be used to identify only the discriminative features. This will be realized by using support vector machine recursive feature elimination to rank features associated with the risk of an ischemic event. The SVM will be trained and tested using information from the patient's clinical follow-up as outcome measure. The outcome (ischemic event or death yes/no)) will enable the development of the SVM classifier to predict outcome. Project Narrative (2 – 3 sentences) In the proposed study, we will develop an advanced intracranial MRI protocol together with a comprehensive image processing pipeline allowing full characterization of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Imaging biomarkers together with clinical and demographic factors will enable the identification of patients at risk to suffer recurring stroke. Machine learning methods will be used to predict risk. Successful completion will allow for better identification of patients who could benefit from endovascular stenting to reduce stroke recurrence.",Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial

"Impact of Clot Histological and Physical Properties on Revascularization Strategies in Acute Ischaemic Stroke - Administrative Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY In the last four years, our group collected >1800 stroke emboli from centers across the US and Canada as part of the Stroke Thromboembolism Registry of Imaging and Pathology (STRIP). The STRIP registry was our current R01 award’s Aim 1 and is very fruitful. We have further elucidated the association between clot histology and revascularization outcomes, as well as clot histology and imaging characteristics. The STRIP registry has also allowed us to uncover novel mechanisms in stroke thrombosis, catalyzing thrombectomy device research and thrombolysis related research in our lab. We believe that the most impactful finding from our registry will be uncovering associations between histopathology of retrieved emboli and stroke etiology. Developing tools to predict stroke etiology is important because nearly 40% of strokes are of unknown etiology. Determine stroke etiology (i.e. cardiac source versus large artery atherosclerosis) is important as secondary stroke prevention strategies are highly dependent on determination of stroke etiology. However, when we performed superficial quantitative analyses examining the relationships between fibrin, platelet, WBC and RBC density, our results were unrevealing. Still, we hypothesize that it remains feasible to predict stroke etiology based of analysis of retrieved stroke emboli through deep learning and machine learning approaches. Machine learning and deep learning approaches can also aid in uncovering histological features associated with device and pharmacological failure related to stroke revascularization. Thus, this administrative supplement’s goal of is to 1) allow for complete digitization and online archiving of our database of over 1800 retrieved clot specimens as well as all available anonymized clinical data from Aim 1 of our current R01 to facilitate deep learning and machine learning and 2) to perform deep learning on the whole slide specimens from these patients to determine if various deep learning and machine learning algorithms can be used to predict stroke etiology based solely off of the histological appearance of retrieved stroke emboli. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute ischemic stroke affects up to 800,000 people per year in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death. Mechanical thrombectomy has become standard of care for acute ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion and up to 150,000 of these procedures will be performed annually by 2025. The etiology of the stroke is unclear in 30-40% of LVO cases. Understanding etiology is important for secondary stroke prevention strategies. The goal of this project is to predict stroke etiology based off histologic characteristics of retrieved clots using AI/ML techniques. The first step is to render our data AI ready which is the main focus of this administrative supplement.",Impact of Clot Histological and Physical Properties on Revascularization Strategies in Acute Ischaemic Stroke - Administrative Supplement,10410193,R01NS105853,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' aortic arch ', ' aorta arch ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arteries ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Award ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Canada ', ' Cause of Death ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Embolism ', ' Embolus ', ' Therapeutic Embolization ', ' Embolization Therapy ', ' Embolotherapy ', ' embolization ', ' Fibrin ', ' Goals ', ' Histology ', ' neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' von Willebrand Factor ', ' Ristocetin Cofactor ', ' Ristocetin-Willebrand Factor ', ' von Willebrand Protein ', ' Work ', ' Deep Vein Thrombosis ', ' Deep-Venous Thrombosis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Thrombectomy ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Left atrial structure ', ' Left Atrium ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' thrombolysis ', ' extracellular ', ' physical property ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Devices ', ' Appearance ', ' Sampling ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' shear stress ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' histological specimens ', ' histological samples ', ' histology samples ', ' histology specimens ', ' online repository ', ' on-line archive ', ' on-line repository ', ' online archive ', ' web repository ', ' web-based repository ', ' atherosclerotic plaque rupture ', ' stroke patient ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' acute care ', ' ']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,315871
"Public sharing of the Aphasia Recovery Cohort Project Summary/Abstract The Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR, P50-DC014664) explores recovery from language impairments following stroke. The center acquires a broad range of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities as well behavioral measures from stroke patients experiencing language impairments. Like all modern large scale NIH grants, C-STAR has a resource sharing plan that guides dissemination of curated data (following an embargo). However, in addition to this data, the C-STAR team has been acquiring images from people with aphasia using our Siemens 3T MRI scanner since 2006. This trove of data, which we refer to as the `Aphasia Recovery Cohort', or ARC, is the product of both internally supported and NIH funded awards that did not require resource sharing plans and includes data from 250 stroke survivors scanned during 5776 unique sessions. In addition to the imaging sessions, ARC patients participated in numerous treatment and assessment sessions providing a rich range of behavioral measures. The current proposal seeks to curate these data to provide an anonymized public database and search tool (ARCquery). This will allow data scientists from around the world to apply their expertise to this archival dataset, providing new insights into brain function as well as identifying predictors of recovery. This repository will provide a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (FAIR) dataset.

"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with

"Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha    Advances in wearable electronics, personal mobile devices, and sensor technology are opening the door to many promising applications in medical care and biomedical research. However, the resulting datasets are often challenging to process due to variability caused by extraneous effects unrelated to the tasks of interest, such as changes in environmental conditions, heteroscedasticity in measurement noise, or patient idiosyncrasies. These effects produce systematic differences between the data used to train machine- learning algorithms and the data on which they are applied in practice, impairing real-world performance. The proposed research will address the fundamental problem of factoring out extraneous effects associated with known nuisance variables. We will develop a novel methodology for extracting features that ar.e invariant to nuisance variables-and hence also to the associated extraneous effects-but that are still useful for classification or regression. The methodology is based on nonparametric deep-network models that perform automatic normalization of the data, and further enforce invariance via adversarial learning. We will apply the approach to an important problem in stroke rehabilitation, the quantitated dosing of motor training. Using a dataset of sensor-based motion data, we will train the model to identify and count functional movements in stroke patients performing rehabilitation activities. We expect to show that our approach can surmount patient variability to enable rigorous movement classification and quantitation. The proposed work is significant, because it will empower investigators to undertake the dosing trials critically needed in stroke rehabilitation. The proposed work is innovative, because it departs from traditional data preprocessing techniques by combining advanced data normalization and model calibration procedures. Our work is likely to have a positive impact on stroke rehabilitation by facilitating the research required to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. Our quantitative approach is broadly generalizable to applications hindered by nuisance variables, such as medical diagnostics and genomics. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise measurement of rehabilitation after stroke.

"Massively high-throughput profiling of the circulating antibody pool for identification of diagnostic signatures with utility for stroke triage PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Stroke is currently the third leading cause of death and leading cause of permanent disability in the United States. Due to the time-efficacy relationship associated with acute stroke interventions, tools which allow for accurate stroke diagnosis during triage have the potential to streamline care and improve patient outcomes. Early transport, transfer, and referral decisions are often made by emergency medical services personnel, triage nurses, and emergency physicians with limited neurological expertise using symptom-based stroke recognition scales. Unfortunately, these assessments exhibit limited accuracy in triage scenarios, and it is currently estimated that up to 30% of patients experiencing stroke are misdiagnosed at first clinician contact, leading to life threatening delays in care. As a result, there has been a push for the identification of stroke-specific blood biomarkers which could be rapidly measured at the point-of-care to help clinicians without extensive neurological expertise make better-informed early triage decisions. It is becoming increasingly evident that the peripheral immune system is intricately involved in stroke pathology, and may be targetable for the development of stroke diagnostics. Not only is there a rapid systemic inflammatory response to the acute injury, but emerging evidence suggests that peripheral immune changes may precede symptom onset and in some cases trigger the acute event itself. The peripheral blood contains up to 1018 unique antibodies targeting antigens associated with nearly every adaptive immune response an individual has experienced in their lifetime, and the repertoire of antibodies found in an individual’s blood can serve as a detailed molecular fingerprint of their immune history as well as current immune status. In the proposed investigation, we aim to identify stroke-associated alterations to the circulating antibody pool which could be used to aid in stroke recognition during triage. To address this aim, peripheral blood will be sampled from a group of consecutive patients suspected of stroke at emergency department admission. Upon final clinical diagnosis, patients will be divided into either a confirmed stroke group or a stroke mimic group. Peptide arrays comprised of 330,000 unique probes will be used to comprehensively assess the binding characteristics of each patient’s peripheral blood antibody pool, and a machine-learning approach will be used to identify a pattern of binding which can optimally discriminate between groups. This work will be the first ever to take a comprehensive approach to profiling the circulating antibody pool in stroke to globally search for disease-specific patterns of alterations; the level of throughput, in combination with the use of powerful machine-learning methods, will increase the odds of identifying diagnostically robust biomarker profiles. Furthermore, diagnostically useful probes identified via peptide array can be readily adapted for use at the point-of-care, providing a clear path to clinical use. This novel, innovative, and highly translational workflow will address an area of dire clinical need; we fully expect to identify a set of candidate peptide probes which will provide the immediate foundation for the development of a rapid point-of-care stroke triage diagnostic. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Quick and confident recognition of stroke at initial clinician contact increases the odds of successful treatment and positive outcome. The proposed clinical study aims to identify patterns of molecular changes in the immune system that are associated with stroke. If successful, the work will lay the immediate groundwork for the development of a rapid blood test that could be used to aid in stroke diagnosis.",Massively high-throughput profiling of the circulating antibody pool for identification of diagnostic signatures with utility for stroke triage,10302835,R21NR019337,"['Ambulances ', ' Antibodies ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Play ', ' Prehospital Emergency Care ', ' Pre-hospital emergency care ', ' Proteins ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Troponin ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immunological markers ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' peripheral blood ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' cohort ', ' immunological status ', ' novel ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Proteome ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' Immune Targeting ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Antibody Repertoire ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' stroke intervention ', ' symptom science ', ' symptom cluster ', ' clinical translation ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' clinical implementation ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' stroke patient ', ' systemic inflammatory response ', ' systemic inflammation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' antibody detection ', ' antibody based detection ', ' detect antibodies ', ' point-of-care detection ', ' ']",NINR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,201250
"Deep Learning Enabled Endovascular Stroke Therapy Screening in Community Hospitals Project Summary/Abstract Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States. Endovascular stroke therapy (EST) has revolutionized the management of large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke (AIS), which accounts for a disproportionate amount of disability in stroke. While this therapy has been shown to significantly improve clinical outcomes in multiple clinical trials, these studies nearly all required screening patients with advanced NeuroImaging such as CT Perfusion (CTP), a modality not available to the majority of community hospitals. As such, there is a pressing need to for a tool able to identify EST candidates leveraging the infrastructure already existing in community hospitals. We envision a software-based service to automate the NeuroImaging evaluation for EST using CT angiography (CTA). We developed and tested a prototype of a novel deep neural network architecture called DeepSymNet. Our preliminary data indicate that uniquely using CTAs we can determine (1) the presence or absence of a large vessel occlusion (2) if the extent of ischemic core and (3) volume of tissue “at risk” (penumbra) is above or below the thresholds used in the clinical trials, when compared to concurrently obtained results using CTP. We will pursue our project goal with three aims: - Aim 1 - Establish one of the largest multi-institution dataset for neuro-imaging research in acute ischemic stroke. We will acquire a multi-center dataset including imaging and clinical data from 15 hospitals across Texas and California, from a range of scanners, imaging acquisition protocols, and hospital types (i.e. large academic and smaller community). - Aim 2 - Develop interpretable deep learning models to determine the eligibility for EST. We will methodically test a set of model architectures, data augmentation strategies, loss functions and pre-processing steps based on DeepSymNet. We will train and test the algorithm against various definitions of infarct core and penumbral volume based on CTP results. This approach will allow for models adaptable to the everchanging definition of EST eligibility.  – Aim 3 - Evaluate the external validity of DeepSymNet-based models on a large multi-center independent dataset. To accomplish this aim, we will deploy our DeepSymNet software on patient imaging and data from multiple hospitals, which were not used in the creation of the software. We will also validate our approach of using CTA alone to determine ischemic core by validating blinded reads of infarct core from CTA source images performed by expert readers against concurrently acquired CTP results. Completion of these aims will have a sustained, transformative impact by supporting the creation and validation of decision support tools readily translatable to the patient bedside in the vast majority of community hospitals across the country. In doing so, we hope to expand the access to high-quality EST screening to thousands of additional AIS patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE With endovascular stroke therapy, we now have the ability to dramatically improve patient outcomes after stroke. To date, however, screening for patients that may benefit from this procedure has been relegated to larger academic centers, as the advanced imaging modalities required for this evaluation are not widely available. The goal of our proposal is to develop and validate machine learning-based software tools to identify patients eligible for endovascular stroke therapy using CT angiography, an imaging modality readily available in the vast majority of community hospitals.",Deep Learning Enabled Endovascular Stroke Therapy Screening in Community Hospitals,10184809,R01NS121154,"['post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' loss of function ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' screening ', ' community center ', ' support tools ', ' Industry Standard ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' patient screening ', ' stroke patient ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' Patient imaging ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' California ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' tool ', ' Intravenous ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Dependence ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' brain tissue ', ' thrombolysis ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' referral center ', ' biomedical referral center ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Institution ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Therapy Evaluation ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,481432
"Balancing Risks and Benefits of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Older Ischemic Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation The 2019 U.S. practice guidelines recommend direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, rivarox- aban, and apixaban over warfarin for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the selection of a DOAC can be challenging for older ischemic stroke patients. The risk-benefit ratios in second- ary stroke prevention differ substantially from those in primary prevention. Not only are older stroke survivors at increased risk for recurrent ischemic events, older age and history of ischemic stroke are also major risk factors for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor anticoagulant therapy according to the effectiveness/safety of the agents and patient unique char- acteristics. The long-term goal is to use comparative effectiveness research to improve quality of care and out- comes in patients with cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry (GWTG-Stroke) and Medicare inpatient and Part D database, the over- all objective of this application is to develop evidence-based strategies to improve appropriate anticoagulant therapy for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF. The central hypothesis is that differ- ences exist between DOACs in terms of effectiveness and safety, which have direct implications for therapeutic selection. Once the relative effectiveness/safety is known, the selection of an anticoagulant can be made based on patient risk profiles, making treatment safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hy- pothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the long-term clinical effectiveness and safety of different DOACs for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF; 2) Investigate DOACs dosing patterns and evaluate the potential impact of underdosing or overdosing on long-term outcomes. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) A patient-centered approach is used to address a real-life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) It shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to a nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in commu- nity practice; 3) A novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted models (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treatment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) Beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to ensure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to help guide personalized anticoagulant therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based anticoagulant therapy for secondary pre- vention in older ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. It is relevant to public health because the devel- opment and adoption of personalized evidence-based anticoagulant therapy are expected to reduce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Balancing Risks and Benefits of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Older Ischemic Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation,10241532,R01AG066672,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', '

"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,10213130,R01HL148248,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' clinical conference ', ' Clinico-Pathologic Conference ', ' Clinico-Pathological Conference ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' heart disease risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Source Code ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' high risk ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical risk ', ' health data ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial bias ', ' race bias ', ' ethnic bias ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' minority communities ', ' high dimensionality ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' stroke model ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' thromboembolic stroke ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,673978
"Functional anomaly mapping of aphasia recovery Project Summary Difficulty communicating (aphasia) is one of the most common and debilitating results of left-hemisphere stroke. Although aphasia symptoms are highly variable and recovery is difficult to predict, much research has shown that lesion size and location are major drivers of aphasia symptoms and recovery. However, this previous research has only considered direct anatomical damage caused by the lesion. This is a critical limitation because stroke lesions also cause indirect effects on the function of brain structures distant from the lesion. Throughout this application, I refer to this as “remote dysfunction.” Although initially thought to resolve quickly after the stroke, remote dysfunction is now known to persist throughout recovery and independently contribute to outcomes. Studies of aphasia recovery have focused almost exclusively on the idea of recovery through reorganization, whereby behavioral improvement occurs through plastic reorganization of brain networks. These studies have eschewed the older idea that recovery occurs through partial resolution of remote dysfunction (RRD) caused by lesions. Consequently, it is not clear how RRD contributes to aphasia recovery. The applicant has developed a new machine learning approach called functional anomaly mapping (FAM) that uses resting BOLD functional MRI signal to map remote dysfunction throughout the brain in individual stroke survivors. FAM maps have much better test-retest reliability than current measures, like task- related fMRI activity and resting state functional connectivity, as well as several other features that make it promising as a clinically useful tool. The applicant has already demonstrated that remote dysfunction measured with FAM relates to behavioral outcomes in people with chronic aphasia. During the mentored phase of this award, the applicant will optimize the FAM approach and test competing hypotheses about the biological mechanisms generating the remote dysfunction measured in chronic aphasia. During the independent phase, the applicant proposes a longitudinal study to understand the contribution of RRD to aphasia recovery. The applicant proposes a comprehensive training plan to expand his knowledge in the following areas: the biological mechanisms of stroke recovery and neuroplasticity beyond aphasia, machine learning, biomarker development, and advanced neuroimaging analysis. The research and training during this award will enable the applicant to develop a long-term, independent research program focused on understanding the neural correlates of aphasia and developing translational brain measures to inform clinical decision-making in aphasia neurorehabilitation. Public Health Relevance Statement Difficulty communicating (aphasia) is one of the most common and debilitating results of left-hemisphere stroke. While aphasia symptoms are highly variable and recovery is difficult to predict, stroke size and location are significant determinants of outcomes. Research that leads to a more complete characterization of how stroke lesions affect residual brain function over the course of recovery will lead to a better understanding of the brain-behavior relationship in aphasia and has the potential to inform clinical decision-making in aphasia neurorehabilitation.",Functional anomaly mapping of aphasia recovery,10214766,K99DC018828,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' neurological rehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' neurological rehab ', ' neurorehab ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Sample Size ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Distant ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modeling ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Characteristics ', ' Deafferentation procedure ', ' Deafferentation ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' brain behavior ', ' chronic stroke ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' neural correlate ', ' biomarker development ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' recovery in aphasia ', ' stroke survivor ', ' Longitudinal prospective study ', ' Long-term prospective studies ', ' Longterm prospective studies ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' stroke-induced aphasia ', ' aphasia due to stroke ', ' aphasia following stroke ', ' poststroke aphasia ', ' stroke aphasia ', ' stroke survivor with aphasia ', ' ']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,121473
"Enhanced Clinical Diagnosis through Imaging and Modeling: A Machine Learning Data Fusion Framework PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this proposal, we will use modern machine learning techniques to combine and enhance computational modeling predictions. We will overcome the physics deficiencies that are inherent in modeling assumptions by including ground-truth clinical measurements, but in turn provide predictions that are more informative (higher spatial and temporal resolution) than the original clinical measurements. Furthermore, we will implement this framework as a surrogate model that can be used in real time and can replace current models with prohibitively high computation cost. If successful, the proposed research will enable lab-to-bedside deployment of a vast array of existing and future computational models and it ultimately could lead to a paradigm shift in health care workflow.  Our overarching hypothesis is that the statistical correlations between computational models and clinical measurements can be exploited in a probabilistic data-fusion framework for more accurate predictions. Our multi-fidelity framework is based on an autoregressive Gaussian Process (GP) scheme. Our proposed scheme is a non-parametric Bayesian machine learning technique that has a probabilistic workflow and estimates uncertainty at different levels of fidelity in a principled manner.  As a template for other clinical applications, we will develop this framework for perfusion scanning of brain hemodynamics in healthy and stroke populations, which has a significant health application. In Aim 1, we will simulate cerebral perfusion in healthy and stroke populations based on CT and MR angiography (CTA and MRA) scans. We will simulate and validate cerebral blood perfusion in healthy and stroke gender-balanced subjects. In Aim 2, we construct subject-specific multi-fidelity models by combining computational results and perfusion scans. We propose to leverage the multi-fidelity model to reduce scan time and radiation exposure by incorporating simulated perfusion maps with CT perfusion scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this proposal we aim to combine computational simulations with clinical measurements with the goal of enhancing the accuracy of the computational models and remedy the physics deficiencies that are inherent in modeling approaches.

"Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal Susceptibility ABSTRACT The detection, localization and quantification of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) plays an important role in diagnosing and establishing appropriate treatment plans in neurodegenerative diseases specifically in vascular dementia (VaD). To date, evaluating CMBs is time consuming, inaccurate and sometimes not possible. We propose to mitigate these problems by developing our software, “qSPIN”, that will provide fast and easy-to-use methods for: 1) automatic identification of CMBs and veins, 2) automatic quantification of CMBs, 3) automatic quantification of oxygen saturation in veins, and 4) creation of a user-friendly software for the practicing radiologist. Recent developments in MRI have provided a new means by which to study the role of CMBs and venous abnormalities in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), VaD, stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) has proven to be a powerful tool by which to detect CMBs and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can be used to measure changes in oxygen saturation. Knowing how many CMBs there are can predict the onset of VaD, determine whether anti-platelet therapy in stroke should be used, and correlate with neuropsychological outcome for patients with TBI. Our recent version of multi-echo SWI makes it possible to obtain both an arteriogram and a venogram simultaneously. Oxygen saturation can also be used to monitor perfusion changes and extend the window of treatment in stroke.  Currently, most radiologists and technologists do not have time to perform such detailed quantitative processing and thus it is not being done clinically. Our qSPIN software will provide this quantitative data. With the number, size, and location of CMBs or venous abnormalities, a better diagnosis would be possible. Our group is uniquely positioned to address this problem having developed many of these techniques. The novelty of our approach is the marriage of SWI, QSM, STAGE and deep learning techniques to detect these vascular and functional abnormalities. To accomplish the goals of this proposal, we will develop user friendly software that incorporates all imaging information from SWI and QSM to label CMBs. We will also provide the location of the CMBs in Talairach coordinates using a template dataset. In the end, we will have a complete picture of the prevalence of CMBs, abnormal oxygen saturation and their locations in patients with neurodegenerative disease that will improve diagnosis and potentially change their treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a huge demand today for a comprehensive analysis of diseases with cerebral microbleeds, abnormal oxygen saturation and thrombosis such as vascular dementia. The quantification of these features will have major ramifications for the diagnosis and treatment of dementia as well hypertension, stroke and traumatic brain injury all of which can lead to dementia. Therefore, our major objective in this application is to design and develop advanced image processing software that can rapidly and accurately identify and quantify the presence of cerebral microbleeds and changes in oxygen saturation in dementia and related diseases.","Automatic Quantification and Labeling of Cerebral Microbleeds, Oxygen Saturation and Sources of Abnormal

"Comparative Safety of Seizure Prophylaxis within the Medicare Program PI Name(s): Moura, Lidia Maria Veras Rocha de   Project Title: Comparative Safety of Seizure Prophylaxis within the Medicare Program 1R01AG073410-01 Each year thousands of Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s disease and/or Alzheimer’s-related dementias (AD/ADRD) receive anticonvulsant drugs for seizure prophylaxis. These drugs are life-saving given the severity of seizure sequalae, but also life-threatening because of serious adverse events. Patients with AD/ADRD are particularly vulnerable given their high susceptibility to both stroke and adverse events. The decision to start and stop anticonvulsants also might change when the patient have AD/ADRD, in part because anticonvulsant therapy management becomes more complex when patients have difficulty with therapy having a narrow therapeutic range or difficulty recognizing early complication symptoms. There are no trial data to guide decisions about prophylaxis after an ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD/ADRD. The sparse and conflicted existing literature has been limited by the difficulty assessing relevant measures, e.g., stroke severity or AD/ADRD status, in claims. Medicare claims offer potential, but lack well-validated definitions for stroke severity, AD/ADRD status, seizures, or adverse effects. We will address these issues using a novel dataset with individual-level linked longitudinal information from registries, electronic health records, and Medicare claims, and will develop prediction models for key baseline and outcome variables. Then, using a random 20% sample of national traditional, fee-for-service Medicare claims over 18 years (2006-23), we will emulate clinical trials assessing two critical decisions in the setting of first mild to moderate ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD/ADRD: a) initiating outpatient prophylaxis versus not; and b) stopping prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. We will apply multiple analytical tools to address confounding and other challenges. We will stratify our population based on AD/ADRD status because the patterns of strokes, post-stroke seizures, and treatment complications differ among patients with compared to those without AD/ADRD, as could the clinical management patterns. We have three aims: 1) To validate claims-based prediction models for our study variables; 2) To emulate a clinical trial comparing outpatient prophylaxis initiation versus not; and 3) To emulate a clinical trial comparing stopping outpatient prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. This comparative safety study could inform future policy and clinical care and improve stroke and AD/ADRD care, e.g., through adjustments in Medicare quality incentives and clinical guidelines. Moreover, these data could help inform patients, families, clinicians, and policy makers about how we can improve care for patients who could require seizure prophylaxis. NARRATIVE Anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed to older adults after stroke to prevent seizures, but these drugs may not be necessary or the harms could outweigh the benefits. There is limited rigorous evidence guiding when and how physicians should prescribe this type of treatment. This project will use the real-world experience of millions of Medicare beneficiaries to generate this evidence and inform both policy and future clinical decisions.",Comparative Safety of Seizure

"Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy This K24 grant will provide the PI, Dr. Lin Yee Chen, a midcareer NIH-funded patient-oriented research (POR) investigator, with the protected time and support needed to (1) accelerate his current trajectory in mentoring junior clinicians and investigators who are conducting POR in cardiovascular (CV) science, (2) acquire additional training in mentoring methods, machine learning, and omics science, (3) promote his current research that aims to define the mechanisms underlying the relationship of the abnormal atrial substrate—atrial cardiomyopathy—and atrial fibrillation (AF) to ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes. Trainees in his AF Clinical Research Group will be recruited from the NIH-funded T32 training programs in the University of Minnesota's Division of Cardiology, Division of Epidemiology, and Division of Biostatistics; Department of Medicine Physician Scientist Training Program; KL2 and TL1 Programs of the CTSI; and graduate programs (MS in Clinical Research, MPH, and PhD) in the School of Public Health. For his career development, Dr. Chen will hone his mentoring skills and learn new skills in cutting-edge areas (machine learning and omics science) through focused study, selected coursework, seminars, and guidance from senior collaborators with domain expertise. Finally, this grant will support a research project that is based on the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, which extends Dr. Chen’s ongoing work to elucidate the role of atrial cardiomyopathy in driving AF-related outcomes. The specific aims are: (1) Identify atrial cardiomyopathy subtypes by using machine learning approaches to analyze the extensive data at ARIC Visit 5 (2011-13): clinical, 2D-echocardiographic, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, ECG, and multi-omics data, (2) Evaluate association of subtypes with ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes, and (3) Discover specific risk factors for subtypes by analyzing risk factor measures collected at Visits 1-4 (1987-98). Crucially, findings will be validated in 2 independent community-based cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). This project has significant impact: (1) This K24 grant will provide the PI with the protected time to enhance his current mentoring of trainees involved in POR. By assembling a team of senior collaborators that comprise experts in mentoring, data science, and molecular epidemiology, the PI provides an outstanding platform for his mentees to acquire cutting-edge skills in POR, (2) By resolving heterogeneity in atrial cardiomyopathy, the team will advance the NIH’s Precision Medicine initiative by personalizing current treatment for patients based on biological underpinnings, (3) The findings will lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in classification of stroke risk in patients with AF, which will improve patient outcomes, (4) By efficiently leveraging existing resources of deeply phenotyped NHLBI cohorts, this project will fill critical knowledge gaps in prevention and treatment, thus achieving a sustained and powerful impact on CV public health, clinical practice, and education of the next generation of researchers in POR. The abnormal atrial substrate (atrial cardiomyopathy) is associated with elevated risks of ischemic stroke dementia, and other cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure. Progress in preventing these adverse outcomes has been hampered by unresolved heterogeneity underlying atrial cardiomyopathy; hence, this K24 grant will support a project that will use machine learning and dense phenotypic data to identify clinically relevant subtypes of atrial cardiomyopathy. Additionally, this K24 grant will foster a supportive environment for the mentoring of junior investigators involved in patient-oriented research and facilitate acquisition of new cutting-edge skills by the PI and his mentees.",Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy,10307378,K24HL155813,"['Aging ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Morbidity -

"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills.

"Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform Project Summary / Abstract  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. Most recovery of functional impairments occurs within the first few weeks after stroke and plateaus thereafter. Unfortunately, even after patients reach a stable phase of recovery, their functional level of the stroke-affected limb may decline. Therefore, it is clinically important to maintain the regained functional level beyond the first couple weeks of spontaneous recovery by continuing to practice the use of the affected limb during daily living.  Wearable technologies have emerged as a low-cost, objective tool to monitor the performance of the upper limbs during activities of daily living (ADLs). However, to date, there exists no study that has investigated the effectiveness of a mobile-health (mHealth) system aiming to enable high-dosage motor performance in chronic stroke survivors in the real-world setting. Specifically, the optimal configuration of the goal setting, feedback mechanism and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) remains unknown.  This proposal aims to develop and validate an mHealth technology that aims to encourage affected limb use during the performance of ADLs in chronic stroke survivors. To accomplish this goal, we will employ the unique finger-worn ring sensor (accelerometer), developed by our academic-industry partnership, that can capture both gross-arm and fine-hand use of the limbs that are essential in the performance of ADLs. We will study important aspects of making positive behavior changes to encourage the affected limb use by fully leveraging the computational insights drawn from sensor data combined with clinical insights from providers.  To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on the development of an mHealth platform, composed of body-networked sensors and cloud-based systems, to monitor the real-world use of the limbs in chronic stroke survivors. In Aim 2, we will develop machine-learning based algorithms to extract clinically meaningful information regarding real-world upper limb use from sensor data. Aim 3 will investigate the optimal design of our mHealth system – such as individual tailoring of the goal, design of the feedback, medium and timing to deliver feedback, and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) – via human-centered design approaches. Finally, in Aim 4, we will validate the short-term (8 weeks) effectiveness of the mHealth system in improving the use of the affected limb through a field deployment study.  We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable a high dosage of physical and occupational therapy, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. It is clinically important that stroke survivors continue to practice the use of the stroke-affected limb in their home and community settings to maintain the functional level learned in the clinic, but currently, there exists no effective, practical clinical tool. In this project, we propose to develop and validate an mHealth technology that will monitor real-world upper limb activity by leveraging our novel finger-worn accelerometer sensors and provide individually-tailored feedback to encourage affected limb use.",Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform,10222670,R01EB027777,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Environment ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Feedback ', ' Fingers ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' hemiparesis ', ' hemiparetic ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Motor Skills ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Occupational Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Using hands ', ' Hand functions ', ' Performance ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' novel ', ' UE paresis ', ' Upper Extremity Pareses ', ' paretic upper extremity ', ' paretic upper limb ', ' upper limb paresis ', ' Brachial Paresis ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Upper limb movement ', ' Impairment ', ' Network-based ', ' chronic stroke ', ' upper limb hemiparesis ', ' usability ', ' community setting ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' data sharing ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' motor recovery ', ' arm movement ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' personalized management ', ' individualized management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' precision management ', ' stroke survivor ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' recruit ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' web platform ', ' internet platform ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2021,493221
"Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS) The current U.S. and European guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. However, selection of antiplatelet agents can be a difficult decision to make for older patients. Not only older individuals are at increased risk for recurrent strokes, they also face risk for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor antiplatelet therapy according to patient unique characteristics, preferences, needs, and values. The long-term goal is to use com- parative effectiveness research to improve primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines Stroke (GWTG) registry and Medicare claims, the overall objective in this application is to develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The central hypothesis is that individuals differ in many characteristics, such as age, sex, presence of comorbid- ities, or concurrent medications, which can influence the potential benefits and harms associated with the treat- ment. Once the variability in response to treatment is known, selection of an antiplatelet agent can be made based on patient risk profiles, preferences, and known efficacy/safety of the agents, making treatment both safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the long-term clinical effectiveness of different antiplatelet regimens in patients with noncar- dioembolic ischemic stroke; 2) determine the long-term safety of different antiplatelet regimens; and 3) balance benefits and harms of each antiplatelet regimen while incorporating patient preferences into decision-making. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) a patient-centered approach is used to address a real- life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) it shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in com- munity practice; 3) novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted mod- els (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treat- ment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to insure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to help guide personalized antiplatelet therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the poten- tial to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. It is relevant to public health because the development and adoption of personalized evidence-based antiplatelet therapy is expected to re- duce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing funda- mental knowledge that will help to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS),10104421,R01AG062770,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Societies ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' clopidogrel ', ' Antiplatelet Drugs ', ' Antiplatelet Agents ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Level of Evidence ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' novel ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Community Practice ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Seminal ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' evidence base ', ' Medicare claim ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Patient risk ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke patient ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' safety outcomes ', ' effectiveness outcome ', ' effectiveness-related outcomes ', ' comparative effectiveness analysis ', ' ']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,509566
"Precision blood pressure management after endovascular stroke therapy based on real-time autoregulation measurements Abstract The following K23 proposal is for Dr. Nils Petersen, a Neurocritical Care and Stroke Neurologist at Yale-New Haven Hospital, and Assistant Professor at Yale University School of Medicine. Dr. Petersen is a physician- scientist with specialized knowledge of human cerebral hemodynamics who is investigating personalized, autoregulation-guided blood pressure management after ischemic stroke. About 40% of patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusion (LVO) are rendered non-ambulatory, bedridden or deceased despite treatment with endovascular thrombectomy. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular autoregulation in the acute phase of LVO stroke increase the risk of secondary brain injury from relative cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion. Thus, autoregulation-guided, personalized blood pressure management presents a promising alternative to the current practice of targeting fixed thresholds. By providing a more favorable physiologic environment for the injured brain, the autoregulation-guided approach may reduce secondary brain injury and improve outcomes. Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Petersen have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan that uses near- infrared spectroscopy and real-time data processing to identify a patient-specific blood pressure range that yields optimal brain blood flow. This research proposal will evaluate if blood pressure management outside personalized limits of autoregulation increases the risk for neurologic worsening from infarct progression or hemorrhagic transformation, leading to increased rates of unfavorable outcome (Aim 1). Next, Dr. Petersen will evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic blood pressure interventions and explore the feasibility of an intervention protocol targeting a personalized blood pressure range (Aim 2). Under the expert mentorship of Dr. Kevin Sheth, Chief of Neurocritical Care, Dr. Randolph Marshall, Director of Stroke Division at Columbia University, and Dr. Cynthia Brandt, Director of Medical Informatics, this K23 award will allow Dr. Petersen 1) to acquire skills in informatics, advanced signal processing and machine learning in order to enhance current methods of quantifying cerebral autoregulation, 2) to develop expertise in clinical trial design, 3) to build a research group dedicated to discovery and clinical evaluation of physiology-based individualized treatment strategies after stroke, and 4) to foster inter-institutional collaboration and data-sharing. This proposal will leverage Yale’s cutting-edge neuro-monitoring technologies along with extensive informatics and research resources from the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation to generate new insights into cerebral hemodynamics and identify treatment opportunities. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Petersen will be well-positioned to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in the area of cerebral hemodynamics. His long-term goal is to use neuro-monitoring to develop physiology-based, personalized, early interventions to reduce the disability and morbidity associated with stroke. Narrative Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance: Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and this research proposal addresses the NIH mission to reduce the burden of neurological disorders and enhance the quality of life of people with disability. Current stroke treatments are primarily aimed at treating blockage of blood vessels but are only partially effective, leaving a great need for additional adjunctive therapies. Effective blood pressure management tailored to individual patients, with the aim of maintaining optimal brain blood flow, may prevent additional brain injury, and is an important first-step towards

"Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and the most common stroke-related impairment is upper-limb hemiparesis, affecting 80% of stroke patients acutely and 40% chronically. Full recovery is unlikely with current rehabilitation approaches, and as a result, stroke reduces quality of life, increases healthcare costs, and burdens caregivers. The long-term goal of this project is to leverage assistive bionic devices to restore motor function and promote long-term neuro-regeneration, ultimately replacing more expensive and less effective rehabilitation approaches with a patient-centered rehabilitation strategy. The objective of this proposal is to control assistive bionic exoskeletons and quantify stroke recovery with electromyographic (EMG) recordings of residual muscle activity from the paretic arm. Our central hypothesis is that an EMG-controlled powered orthosis – that assists individuals in activities of daily living – can be used as a patient-specific rehabilitative tool that improves stroke recovery. Aim 1 will adapt dexterous EMG-control algorithms for upper-limb orthoses, and then demonstrate improved hand dexterity and functional mobility for stroke patients. Aim 2 will utilize large EMG datasets over time to precisely quantify changes in muscle strength and spasticity throughout recovery and to provide robust long-term control of assistive devices via deep learning. Aim 3 consists of a pilot study to determine the feasibility of patient-specific assistive-device-driven rehabilitation. The proposed research is innovative because it will address gaps in knowledge critical to merging assistive and rehabilitative devices. These findings are significant because they will enable devices that can immediately and simultaneously promote usage, strengthen muscles, and provide closed-loop visual feedback – thereby merging multiple effective rehabilitation strategies into a single holistic approach. This proposal will have a positive impact on society by increasing rehabilitation compliance, promoting independence and improving recovery outcomes for stroke patients, ultimately reducing healthcare costs and improving patients’ quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This project aims to bridge the gap between assistive devices and rehabilitative tools so that stroke patients with a paretic arm can immediately return to their daily routine and use their activities of daily living as a patient-specific rehabilitation strategy. Assistive bionic exoskeletons will be intuitively controlled with residual muscle activity from the paretic arm, and artificial intelligence will elucidate underlying muscle impairment, improve the dexterity of bionic devices, and temporarily assist and rehabilitate stroke patients. This proposal is relevant to NIH’s mission because it has strong potential to improve quality of life for stroke patients and their caregivers, as well as reduce overall healthcare costs.",Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography,10260456,DP5OD029571,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Bionics ', ' Electromyography ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hand ', ' Hospitals ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Muscle Spasticity ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Regeneration ', ' Neuro-regeneration ', ' Neuronal regeneration ', ' Neuroregeneration ', ' nervous system regeneration ', ' neural regeneration ', ' neuroregenerative ', ' regenerated nerve ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' Orthotic Devices ', ' Orthosis ', ' orthotics ', ' Paresis ', ' Muscle Paresis ', ' Muscular Paresis ', ' paretic ', ' paretic muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Physical Medicine ', ' Physiatrics ', ' Physiatry ', ' Rehabilitation Medicine ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Rehabilitation Centers ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Running ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Societies ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' neurological rehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' neurological rehab ', ' neurorehab ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' muscle strength ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Services ', ' handbook ', ' exoskeletal ', ' exoskeleton ', ' visual feedback ', ' professor ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Agreement ', ' graduate student ', ' holistic approach ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' career development ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' resistance training ', ' strength training ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' lecturer ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' BCL2-Interacting Protein ', ' DP5 ', ' Harakiri ', ' HRK gene ', ' Address ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Human Subject Research ', ' Motor ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' post stroke ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Rehabilitation device ', ' rehab device ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' upper limb hemiparesis ', ' hemiparetic stroke ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' Secure ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' dexterity ', ' data visualization ', ' arm paresis ', ' paretic arm ', ' faculty mentor ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke outcome ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,DP5,2021,327385
