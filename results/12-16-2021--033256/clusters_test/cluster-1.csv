"Characterizing the serum metabolome in multiple sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  Within the last decade, we have made great strides in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying multiple sclerosis (MS) risk and progression, however much of the variation remains unexplained. We have achieved significant reductions in the time to diagnosis and we have improved diagnostic sensitivity, however specificity is not ideal. Further, most of the FDA-approved MS-specific immunomodulatory therapies (IMTs) focus on the inflammatory disease component in the relapsing phase and have little effect on improving outcomes once a patient enters the progressive phase. The challenge for drug trials is the lack biomarkers to detect and monitor MS progression. The objectives of the current application are: 1. To identify and characterize biomarkers that discriminate MS and from other central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating diseases (CNSIDDs) and non-CNSIDD controls, and 2. To identify biomarkers of disease activity and biomarkers that distinguish relapsing from progressive forms of MS. We propose a multi-stage analysis of pre-existing and well- defined biological samples from two resources.  Aim 1. Identify biochemical traits that discriminate MS from other CNSIDDs and healthy controls. Supervised machine learning and classification models will identify a metabolic signature discriminating MS from other CNSIDDs and healthy controls (HCs) in two cohorts. In the 1st cohort, MS patients who are early in their diagnosis (≤ 2 years) and IMT naïve/free will be compared to HCs and other CNSIDD cases. Discriminating metabolites will be tested for replication in a 2nd cohort comparing similarly defined MS patients to HCs and other CNSIDDs, and other autoimmune disease patients. We will determine the direction of the replicating MS- metabolite associations using bidirectional genetic instrumental variable analyses. Aim 2. Identify biochemical features of MS disease activity. We will identify metabolic variation corresponding to disease activity by comparing IMT naïve/free patients within 2 years of diagnosis and with a recent relapse to those who have been in remission for ≥3 months and to HCs using supervised classification in a discovery cohort followed by replication analyses in a 2nd cohort. Aim 3. Identify biochemical traits that discriminate progressive from relapsing MS. Supervised machine learning and classification models will identify metabolic patterns associated with MS progression by comparing IMT naïve/free patients with relapsing forms of MS to progressive MS from at a single academic specialty clinic. Aim 4. Identify metabolites that interact with HLA-DRB1*15:01 to increase MS risk. In this exploratory aim we will identify gene-metabolite (GxM) interactions involving the primary MS risk factor, HLA-DRB1*15:01. The encoded peptide is involved in antigen presentation and effectively binds to many endogenous metabolites, suggesting a mechanism through which autoreactive T cells may be activated. We will conduct GxM analyses in MS-HC matched pairs to identify metabolites associated with MS risk in the context of HLA-DRB1.  At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcomes are to have identified and characterized a serum-derived metabolomic signature that discriminates MS from other CNSIDDs and non- CNSIDD controls. We also expect to have identified novel serum markers of MS disease activity and progression, as well as putative metabolites that interact with HLA-DRB1*15:01 to modify risk. These results will have an important positive impact by identifying serum-derived biochemical traits that could be used to improve diagnostic specificity in MS. There is also the promise of discerning novel molecular processes underlying MS, which will provide new opportunities for the development and evaluation of novel therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE It is possible that in the U.S. near 20% of the 900,00 persons with an established multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis may have been misdiagnosed, with 60-70% having been on FDA-approved MS immunomodulatory therapies. Misdiagnosis represents an unacceptable burden, thus there is a critical need for accurate discrimination of MS from non-MS conditions, and there is a need for biomarkers that can monitor disease activity and progression. We hypothesize that the serum metabolome is an attractive non-invasive target for identifying such biomarkers. In this proposal we seek to: 1. Identify and characterize biomarkers that discriminate MS and from non-MS conditions and unaffected controls, and 2. Identify biomarkers of relapse activity and biomarkers that distinguishes relapsing from progressive forms of MS.",Characterizing the serum metabolome in multiple sclerosis,10197636,R01NS121928,"['Antibodies ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Financial cost ', ' Demyelinating Diseases ', ' Demyelinating Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuromyelitis Optica ', ' Devic Disease ', "" Devic's Syndrome "", ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Specificity ', ' Suggestion ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein ', ' MOG glycoprotein ', ' myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' HLA-DRB1 ', ' HLA-DRB1 antigen ', ' Migraine ', ' Migraine Headache ', ' Serum Markers ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Antigen Presentation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' disability ', ' Neurologic Symptoms ', ' Neurologic Manifestations ', ' Neurologic Signs and Symptoms ', ' Neurological Manifestations ', ' Neurological Signs and Symptoms ', ' neural manifestation ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Free Will ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' Diagnostic Specificity ', ' Metabolite Interaction ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', "" Sjogren's Syndrome "", ' Sicca Syndrome ', ' Sjogrens ', ' Sjögren Syndrome ', ' xerodermosteosis ', ' autoreactive T cell ', ' self-reactive T cell ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' FDA approved ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' multiple sclerosis patient ', ' MS patient ', ' patients with MS ', ' patients with multiple sclerosis ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' targeted therapy trials ', ' targeted drug trials ', ' targeted pharmaceutical trials ', ' targeted treatment trials ', ' improved outcome ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' immunomodulatory therapies ', ' Immune Modulation Therapy ', ' immune modulating therapies ', ' immune modulatory therapies ', ' immune-modulation treatment ', ' immunomodulation therapy ', ' immunomodulation treatment ', ' immunomodulatory therapy ', ' immunomodulatory treatment ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,518973
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,10197115,F30DK118774,"['Age ', ' ages ', '

"Frequency domain diffuse optical spectroscopy and diffuse correlation spectroscopy for assessing inspiratory muscle metabolism in mechanically ventilated patients PROJECT SUMMARY Mechanical ventilation (MV), which is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing in critically ill patients, led to $27 billion in expenditures in the US in 2010, accounting for 12% of all hospital costs. In that same year there were 2.7 episodes of MV per 1000 population, highlighting the enormous importance of this procedure. The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially increased these numbers, although precise rates are not yet available. MV is used, in part, to “unload”, or reduce the metabolic effort of respiratory muscles in order to redirect oxygen delivery to vital organs. As the patients’ conditions improve, key inspiratory muscles (e.g. diaphragm, scalenes, sternomastoid, etc.) need to take over spontaneous breathing independent of the ventilator. This “reloading” is precarious due to muscle disuse atrophy, induced by unloading. This is further complicated by other common conditions such as septic or cardiogenic shock, which can severely limit oxygen delivery independent of muscle status. What’s needed is a methodology that can continuously monitor blood flow and oxygen utilization of inspiratory muscles so that respiratory effort can be continuously optimized during MV. This project aims to develop a comprehensive blood flow index, oxygenation, and metabolic measurement platform for inspiratory muscle physiology by integrating wideband frequency-domain diffuse optical spectroscopy (wbDOS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to tackle this unmet need. wbDOS is a new all-digital frequency-domain DOS technique that captures amplitude and phase measurements over a wide bandwidth of modulation frequencies (50-500 MHz) at high speeds (>100 Hz). wbDOS and DCS will combine synergistically to provide pathlength- corrected estimates of absolute Hb/Mb concentrations and blood flow index (BFi), allowing for the extraction of tissue regional oxygen metabolic rate (MRO2i), a parameter directly linked to oxygen utilization. We hypothesize that wbDOS and DCS measurements can be acquired simultaneously at high speed (>10 Hz) with parallel detection and integrated electronics. This speed is needed to capture inspiratory/expiratory dynamics at the respiratory rate. Additionally, we hypothesize wideband frequency-domain DOS measurements will provide improved quantification of optical properties, BFi and MRO2i when optically integrated with DCS as compared to single frequency FD-DOS or CW-NIRS. We will validate this through rigorous system testing using flow-channel tissue-mimicking optical phantoms. A multi-layer inverse model will be developed to better capture inspiratory muscle metabolism by accounting for subcutaneous lipid thickness and skin tones. We will also expand on our recent work in Deep Neural Network (DNN) processing to develop high-speed algorithms for calculating Hb/Mb concentrations, StO2 (%), BFi (mm2/s), and MRO2i at 10 Hz. We will conduct a feasibility study (n=10) of healthy volunteers during respiratory muscle loading and unloading to evaluate performance compared to expected trends. It is anticipated that completion of these aims will yield a novel and comprehensive blood flow index, oxygenation, and metabolic measurement platform (wbDOS-DCS) and lead to subsequent R01-scale funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here focuses on developing and validating a new non-invasive way to measure the metabolism of inspiratory muscles for patients under mechanical ventilation. This proposal focuses on technology development and clinical feasibility, and in the future this same technology can be used to improve the efficacy of mechanical ventilation and improve weaning success. As mechanical ventilation is currently associated with severe morbidities and a high mortality rate, improvements based on the technology proposed here have the potential to improve outcomes and decrease mortality for patients under mechanical ventilation.",Frequency domain diffuse optical spectroscopy and diffuse correlation spectroscopy for assessing inspiratory muscle metabolism in mechanically ventilated patients,10194837,R21EB031250,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Boston ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Respiratory Diaphragm ', ' Diaphragm ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Expenditure ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Respiratory Muscles ', ' Ventilatory Muscles ', ' Cardiogenic Shock ', ' Septic Shock ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Ventilator ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Boa ', ' Link ', ' Sternocleidomastoid Muscle ', ' sternocleidomastoid ', ' sternomastoid ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Blood flow ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' Disuse Atrophy ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' septic ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' muscle metabolism ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Skin ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' digital ', ' Population ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' metabolic rate ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' improved outcome ', ' muscle physiology ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID crisis ', ' COVID epidemic ', ' COVID pandemic ', ' COVID-19 crisis ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID-19 global health crisis ', ' COVID-19 global pandemic ', ' COVID-19 health crisis ', ' COVID-19 public health crisis ', ' COVID19 crisis ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 global health crisis ', ' COVID19 global pandemic ', ' COVID19 health crisis ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' COVID19 public health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 pandemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease crisis ', ' coronavirus disease epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease pandemic ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic ', ' ']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2021,215000
"Molecular modeling and machine learning for protein structures and interactions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Structural biology provides a powerful lens through which to view living systems. With advances in algorithms and computing, molecular simulations have begun to complement traditional experimental approaches as tools for discovery. At the same time, data-intensive machine learning approaches are becoming increasingly important in biology, fueled by the rapid growth in high-throughput experimentation. Research in my laboratory applies techniques from structural biology, molecular simulation, and machine learning to design new protein structures and predict protein interactions. We design new protein structures in order to better understand the principles of protein folding and to create highly stable and robust molecular scaffolds for a range of biomedical applications including multivalent display of binding or signaling domains, hosting of binding or catalytic sites, and use as building blocks to assemble higher-order complexes. We predict protein interactions in order to better understand the principles of macromolecular recognition and to gain insight into the process by which the adaptive immune system discriminates self from non-self in the context of infectious and autoimmune diseases and cancer. Our research during the project period will be directed toward two broad goals: de novo design and functionalization of tandem repeat proteins, and prediction of peptide-MHC recognition by T cell receptors (TCRs). The proposed protein design work builds on our recent progress designing circular tandem repeat proteins with a range of repeat numbers and diameters and applying these designs as multivalent display scaffolds for the presentation of binding and signalling domains. Our TCR studies leverage the tools we have recently developed to model—structurally and bioinformatically—repertoires of T cell receptors and their peptide:MHC specificity. Looking ahead, I am optimistic that by combining atomically-detailed molecular simulations and data-intensive machine learning techniques we will be able to generate designed protein constructs and predictive algorithms that have a significant positive impact on human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop new computer algorithms for designing protein structures and predicting protein interactions. The rationally designed proteins that we create will have potential uses as molecular scaffolds in a wide range of biomedical applications including diagnostics and cellular therapies.

"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Human Retina PROJECT SUMMARY Vision, the most important of the human senses, occupies 25% of the brain function. It requires an orchestrated coordination between all parts of the eye. Of all the parts, the retina is the most vital for normal perception of an image. It is a precisely layered structure lining the surface of the back of the eye, comprising many millions of cells packed together in a tightly knit network. The optic nerve connects the retina with the brain. The retina not only receives light, but also processes it, and transmits downstream signals to the midbrain and the thalamus. When the retina becomes diseased, the unfortunate result is blindness, which is the most feared disability. Diseases that affect the retina are complex because of the diverse number of cell types and total number of cells involved. It remains challenging to assess if pathological phenotypes affect diverse cell populations versus highly specific cell types. While advances in retinal disease diagnostics have progressed rapidly, treatments for retinal diseases directed at primary genetic defects have progressed slowly. Despite major successes in genetics, the vision community is lagging behind the advances in precision medicine occurring in other specialties. Modest progress is due in part to an incomplete understanding of human retinal biology. Anatomical differences between humans and commonly used animal models have severely hindered the translation of results from laboratory to human health. Therefore, there is an urgent need to collect and analyze retinal cells from human eyes to advance our understanding of human retinal diseases and assess the cell type conservation between mouse and human. Recent technologic breakthroughs in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) have made it possible to measure gene expression in single cells, paving the way for exploring cellular heterogeneity. Collaborating with the Alabama Eye Bank, we will deeply sample human retinal cells, fully characterize cell diversity, and elucidate the functional roles of findings from genome- wide association studies for retinal diseases. We propose the following aims. Aim 1 will generate scRNA-seq data from eyes of 20 healthy adult human donors, and produce de-noised gene expression data for downstream analyses. Aim 2 will characterize cell diversity in human retina and supporting tissues, and validate novel cell type-specific marker genes by immunohistochemistry. Aim 3 will infer cell type compositions and allele-specific gene expression in each cell type by integrating scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data from normal human eyes. These pioneering studies leverage novel methods and interdisciplinary expertise to characterize cell type-specific gene expression in human retina and supporting tissues. By detailed characterization of the cell atlases in four geographical areas in human eye, our study will provide novel insights into cell-type specific functions that can power precision therapeutic targeting of retinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE The retina is the most vital for normal perception of an image in the eye. Diseases that affect the retina are complex, and it remains challenging to assess if pathological phenotypes originate in diverse cell populations or highly specific cell types.

"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,10158441,R01AR077060,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' bone ', ' Calcium ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Claustrophobias ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Crystallization ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' effusion ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mission ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Popliteal Cyst ', "" Baker's Cyst "", ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Standardization ', ' Syndrome ', ' Synovial Membrane ', ' Membrana Synovialis Capsulae Articularis ', ' Synovium ', ' Synovitis ', ' inflamed synovial tissue ', ' inflamed synovium ', ' synovial inflammation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Specialist ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Physical activity ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Meniscus ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' knee OA ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Clinic ', ' Crystal Deposition ', ' Crystal Formation ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Categories ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Assessment Tool ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases ', ' NIAMS ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Implant ', ' population based ', ' rheumatologist ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Bone Spur ', ' osteophyte ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' imaging genetics ', ' recruit ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,331837
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,10144417,R01DK101674,"['Acids ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Anaerobic Bacteria ', ' anaerobe ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Genes ', ' Gnotobiotic ', ' Gnotobiotics ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Individuality ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Libraries ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Poison ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' toxic compound ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Tyrosine ', ' Uremia ', ' uremia of renal origin ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Diet Modification ', ' Dietary Modifications ', ' diet alteration ', ' dietary alteration ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Cresol ', ' tricresol ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Anabolism ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Individual ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Sulfate ', ' Ablation ', ' human data ', ' mutant ', ' solute ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' microbiome ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' frontier ', ' Individual Differences ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Microbe ', ' reconstitution ', ' reconstitute ', ' gut microbiota ', ' GI microbiota ', ' Gastrointestinal microbiota ', ' enteric microbial community ', ' enteric microbiota ', ' gastrointestinal microbial flora ', ' gut commensal ', ' gut community ', ' gut flora ', ' gut microbe community ', ' gut microbial community ', ' gut microbial composition ', ' gut microbial consortia ', ' gut microbiotic ', ' gut microflora ', ' intestinal flora ', ' intestinal microbes ', ' intestinal microbiota ', ' intestinal microflora ', ' intestinal tract microflora ', ' comparative genomics ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' microbiota ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' translation to humans ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' colon microbiota ', ' colon microbes ', ' colon microbial community ', ' colonic microbiota ', ' microbiota metabolites ', ' microbiota derived metabolites ', ' Infrastructure ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,644301
"In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging ABSTRACT There is still great need in better characterizing new targeted therapies in vivo, especially prior to clinical translation. In this regard, preclinical molecular imaging is a central tool in the targeted drug development pipeline. However, there is still a lack of integrated imaging platforms that can enable longitudinal (multiple time points) and spatially-resolved monitoring of complex fingerprints including molecular, metabolic and functional signatures in the same tumor/subject. This new integrated multiplexing imaging platform will play a crucial role in the development of the next generation of targeted drugs and elucidating (multi-) drug resistance mechanisms. Recently, we have demonstrated the unique capabilities of optical imaging in quantifying receptor-target engagement in live subjects by leveraging fluorescence lifetime. This outstanding achievement was realized thanks to the combination of instrumental, algorithmic and biochemical innovations to enable, for the first time, whole-body time-resolved optical imaging based on structured light for 2D or 3D Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in live subjects. Herein, we will further impact the field of optical preclinical imaging and drug delivery assessment by 1) integrating a cutting-edge high-resolution, time-resolved SPAD array imager for improved photon collection efficiency, spatial resolution, and portability; 2) we will harness the latest developments in Deep Learning (DL) for ultra-fast, quantitative, but fitting/iterative inverse solver-free image formation, in both 2D and 3D providing image formation/processing solutions to facilitate multiplexed imaging; 3) we will implement new functionalities in our imaging platform to enable the concurrent longitudinal imaging of multiple clinically relevant target-receptor interactions (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals. NARRATIVE Following an ever increased focus on personalized medicine, there is a continuing need to develop preclinical molecular imaging modalities to guide the development and optimization of targeted therapies. This research program will combine novel time-resolved cameras as well as deep learning techniques to broaden the impact of macroscopic lifetime imaging with the overarching goal to facilitate multiplexed imaging for a comprehensive assessment of cellular delivery efficacy of multiple clinically relevant drugs (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as drug

"Multimodal Intraoral Imaging System for Oral Cancer Detection and Diagnosis in Low Resource Setting Oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) together rank as the sixth most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 400,000 new cancer cases each year. Two-thirds of these cancers occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While the 5-year survival rate in the U.S. is 62%, the survival rate is only 10- 40% and cure rate around 30% in the developing world. The poor survival rate in LMICs is mainly due to late diagnosis and the resultant progression of disease to an advanced stage at diagnosis. Therefore, it is imperative to diagnose precursor and malignant lesions in LRS early and expeditiously.  To meet the need for technologies that enable comprehensive oral cancer screening and diagnosis in low resource settings (LRS) to identify the suspicious lesions, triage the high-risk subjects and thereby enable appropriate treatment management and follow up, this project brings together an interdisciplinary team with complementary expertise in optical imaging, oncology, deep learning, technology translation, and commercialization. The team will develop, validate, and clinically translate a multimodal intraoral imaging system for oral cancer detection and diagnosis with better sensitivity and specificity. This work will address key barriers to adopting optical imaging techniques for oral cancer in LRS by building on the team’s experience in 1) developing and evaluating dual-mode (polarized white light imaging [pWLI] and autofluorescence imaging [AFI]) mobile imaging probes; 2) evaluating a low-cost, portable optical coherence tomography (OCT) system for oral cancer detection and diagnosis in a nodal center setting in India; and 3) developing and evaluating deep learning-based image classification algorithms for clinical decision-making guidance. As each of these key techniques has been demonstrated separately for oral cancer imaging in LRS, the potential of successfully developing a multimodal intraoral imaging system for accurate, objective and location-resolved diagnosis of oral cancer and transitioning to a new capability to medical professionals in LRS is very high. To achieve the project objective, the team proposes three Aims: 1) develop a portable, semi-flexible, and compact multimodal intraoral imaging system; 2) evaluate the clinical feasibility of the prototyped intraoral imaging system and develop deep learning-based image processing algorithms for early detection, diagnosis, and mapping of oral dysplastic and malignant lesions; and 3) validate the capability of the prototyped intraoral imaging system for diagnosing oral dysplasia and malignant lesions.  Successful completion of this project will lead to the transition of a multimodal intraoral imaging system and deep learning image classification that leverage the individual strengths of multiple technologies and deliver new and urgently-needed capabilities to the end users in LRS.

"Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence Abstract Enzyme functionality is a critical component of all life systems. Whereas advances in experimental methodology have enabled a better understanding of factors that control enzyme function, critical components of the reaction space such as highly unstable intermediates and transition states are best accessed for evaluation through computational simulations. Similarly, computational methodology continues to provide a key resource for probing excited-state processes such as bioluminescence. Combined ab initio quantum mechanical molecular mechanical (ai-QM/MM) simulations are, in principle, the preferred choice in the modeling of both processes. But ai-QM/MM modeling of enzymatic reactions is now severely limited by its computational cost, where a direct ai-QM/MM free energy simulation of an enzymatic reaction can take 500,000 or more CPU hours. Meanwhile, ai-QM/MM modeling of firefly bioluminescence is also hindered by the computational accuracy, where it has yet to produce quantitatively correct predictions for the bioluminescence spectral shift with site-directed mutagenesis. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate ai-QM/MM simulations of enzymatic reaction free energy and to improve the quality of ai-QM/MM-simulated bioluminescence spectra, so that ai-QM/MM simulations can be routinely performed by experimental groups. This will be achieved via a) using a lower-level (semi-empirical QM/MM) Hamiltonian for sampling; b) an enhancement to the similarity between the two Hamiltonians by calibrating the low-level Hamiltonian using the reaction pathway force matching approach, in conjunction with several other methods. The expected outcomes of this collaborative effort include: a) advanced methodologies for accelerated reaction free energy simulations and accurate bioluminescence spectra predictions, which will be released through multiple software platforms; b) a fundamental understanding of reactions such as Kemp elimination and polymerase-eta catalyzed DNA replication; c) a deeper insight into the role of macromolecular environment in the modulation of enzyme catalytic activities or bioluminescence wavelengths, which can further enhance our capability of designing new enzymes and bioluminescence probes. Narrative This project aims to develop quantum-mechanics-based computational methods to more quickly model enzymatic reactions and more accurately model bioluminescence spectra. It will lead to reliable and efficient computational tools for use by the general scientific community. It will facilitate the probe of enzymatic reaction mechanisms and the computer-aided design of new bioluminescence probes.",Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence,10234111,R01GM135392,"['Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase ', ' DNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerases ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Ions ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Multienzyme Complexes ', ' enzyme complex ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Temperature ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Fireflies ', ' Lampyridae ', ' Bioluminescence ', ' Computer-Aided Design ', ' Computer-Assisted Design ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Electrostatics ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' mutant ', ' DNA Replication ', ' DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA biosynthesis ', ' Free Energy ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Polymerase ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Quantum Mechanics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' experimental group ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2021,254846
"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,10224676,RC2DK114777,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aorta ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' blastomere structure ', ' Blastocytes ', ' Embryonic Cell ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell-Free System ', ' Cellfree System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Gonadal structure ', ' gonad ', ' gonads ', ' Grant ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' blood stem cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hemopoietic progenitor ', ' hemopoietic stem cell ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mesonephric structure ', ' Mesonephros ', ' Wolffian Body ', ' Methods ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Generations ', ' notch protein ', ' notch ', ' notch receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ', ' Agonist ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Co-culture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Coculture ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' ES cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' novel ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Bypass ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Stem Cell Development ', ' progenitor cell development ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' loss of function ', ' self-renewal ', ' self-renew ', ' stem ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' stem cell population ', ' Systems Development ', ' clinical translation ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' hematopoietic stem cell expansion ', ' HSC expansion ', ' blood stem cell expansion ', ' hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal ', ' HSC regeneration ', ' HSC self-renewal ', ' hematopoietic stem cell regeneration ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Specification ', ' HSC Specification ', ' ']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2021,650976
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses.

"Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties ABSTRACT Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have broad-based potential in regenerative medicine cell therapies and can be isolated from a variety of different tissues. Though MSCs from different tissues are phenotypically similar, a barrier to their clinical use is the high variability of their trophic and regenerative properties. This variability suggests that inherent differences exist in the molecular machinery guiding MSC properties between different MSC populations, yet, to date, these differences are ill-defined. To this end, we have preliminary evidence that MSC phenotypes correlate to their regenerative outcomes. In this study, we aim to elucidate how the molecular and cellular properties of distinct MSC populations determine their regenerative properties. Our hypothesis is that MSCs from different tissues have different regenerative properties which correlate to specific molecular profiles defined by gene expression and transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis, the project proposed has three Specific Aims (SAs). In SA1, we will determine how tissue-specificity dictates gene expression and dynamic transcription factor activity of distinct MSCs. SA2 will determine how differences in the cellular and molecular properties of MSCs correlate to MSC phenotype. Finally, in SA3, we will determine how the molecular profiles and cellular activities of MSCs dictate their regenerative properties. Findings of the proposed study will provide novel insights about how the distinct molecular profiles of MSCs dictate their biological and physiological properties. In a therapeutic context, this would enable the development of innovative screening technologies for MSC therapies to identify and enrich for the most appropriate MSC for the specific therapeutic application. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Stem cell therapies are emerging as a new treatment approach to regenerate lost tissues, treat ischemic disorders, and treat chronic inflammatory conditions.

"Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation Project Summary/Abstract Cancer metabolism is a complex network of perturbations to essential chemical and enzymatic reactions; however, the past century has seen a largely reductionist approach to understanding this system. While previously this approach was necessary due to technological limitations, current computer age technological advances allow us to survey, model, and explore the biological details of individual cells and populations of cells. Scientific fields, such as RNA biology and metabolism, have experienced massive strides in recent decades with the advent of RNA-seq and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, yet our ability to contextualize and extract the full extent of these enormous datasets continues to lag and often results in focusing on only a handful of entities from a dataset. This effectively causes “big data” to become “little data”. This is problematic as these experiments are often expensive and time-consuming to produce, yet we only use a fraction of the total data produced by a given experiment. For the F99 phase of my proposal, I will address these limitations by leading the development of Metaboverse, a multi-omic computational analysis framework built upon our previous work to contextualize -omics datasets within customizable and global metabolic network representations. This framework will lay the foundation allowing for the exploration of complex forms of metabolic regulation in cancer. For example, we will analyze the ability of metabolic networks to undergo dispersed and low-magnitude regulation, where, rather than one or two components acting as the core regulatory actors, regulation is performed by dispersed groups of genes, proteins, or metabolites. This framework and related regulatory research will revolutionize our ability to more holistically understand temporal metabolic shifts and gene-metabolite intra-cooperativity, as well as ensure we obtain the maximum amount of information from our data. For the K00 phase of my proposal, I will work with a postdoctoral mentor at an NCI-Designated Cancer Center or affiliated institution that will supplement my training in machine learning and network biology to develop models that improve our ability to predict metabolic state from transcriptomic state. Doing so will allow us to harness the vast transcriptomics databases in cancer biology to better understand the role of metabolism across heterogeneous tumor cell populations. My ultimate goal is to become a tenured professor and run an independent, NIH-funded research lab that focuses on computational cancer metabolism research and that develops methods for interrogating this emerging domain of biology. Project Narrative While cancer metabolism is a robust and well-developed research field, approaches to its holistic understanding are still under-developed and hinder our ability to contextualize these complex metabolic states and their consequences. During the F99 phase, I will develop tools and methods that allow researchers to explore data in a more holistic manner than previously possible, which will be essential to elucidating more complicated regulatory mechanisms within cancer metabolism. During the K00 phase, I will develop novel machine learning algorithms that will improve our ability to predict the metabolic state from the transcriptional state, allowing us to harness the rich transcription datasets found in cancer biology for therapeutic benefit.",Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation,10221654,F99CA253744,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computers ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' chemical reaction ', ' experience ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' professor ', ' novel ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Data ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Post-Transcriptional Control ', ' post-transcriptional gene regulation ', ' posttranscriptional control ', ' posttranscriptional regulation ', ' Post-Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Predictive Cancer Model ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' neglect ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' transcriptomics ', ' tumor ', ' tumor metabolism ', ' cancer cell metabolism ', ' cancer metabolism ', ' tumor cell metabolism ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning network ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' ribosome profiling ', ' Ribo-seq ', ' ribosome footprint profiling ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F99,2021,35758
"Integrated visualization, control, and analysis of GEF – GTPase networks in living cells A small number of Rho family GTPases participate in a broad array of fundamental cellular behaviors. Specificity is possible due to spatial and temporal control of GTPase “activation”; Guanine exchange factors (GEFs) generate activated, GTP-bound GTPases with precise timing and localization, while specialized interactions with adhesion molecules, membrane domains and other localized structures specify GEF-GTPase interactions. GEF/GTPase circuits are complex, with localized feedbacks, multiple GEFs controlling one GTPase, and vice versa. To dissect this spatiotemporally regulated circuitry requires imaging, and new analytical techniques that can dissect causal relationships from imaging data. Following the intentions of PAR- 19-158 (Bioengineering Research Grants), we propose a multidisciplinary collaboration leveraging organic chemistry, protein engineering, imaging, and computer science to fudnamentally advance signal transduction imaging and analysis. As a biological testbed we will explore the role of GEF-GTPase interactions in cell protrusion, single cell migration and collective migration. We will develop a generalizable approach to GEF biosensors, and adapt our proven GTPase biosensors to image GEF and GTPase activities in the same cell. Because GEF-GTPase interactions are heterogeneous and complex, multiplexed imaging is necessary to quantify their relative dynamics. However, perturbation of cell behavior is especially problematic when using two biosensors in the same cell. We will therefore develop new biosensor designs that greatly reduce cell perturbation. Even the most precise imaging of overlapping molecular activations has not revealed causal relationships. We will therefore adopt the framework of Granger Causality inference, which was originally devised for financial market analysis, to extract causal connections and feedback interactions from imaging data. Numerous steps will be necessary to translate the existing concepts of Granger causality to the analysis of spatially and temporally distributed molecular processes. Most importantly, we will implement a schema for Granger causality inference in multivariate time series models that will capture spatial relations, and we will combine principles of high-dimensional statistical regression with approaches from control theory to estimate information flows between variables that are coupled by strong feedbacks. We will also develop a novel clustering approach that preserves the neighborhood topology of data in a high-dimensional feature space and in the Euclidian space of the cell outline to identify signaling microdomains. Finally, to test and confirm our hypotheses, we will use new photo-activatable and photo-inhibitable analogs of GEFs together with GTPase biosensors to control one protein while observing another. This research plan will produce biosensors with reduced perturbation, biosensor/optogenetic multiplexing capabilities, and image analysis/modeling approaches necessary to shed light on the network topology of nonlinear, spatiotemporally controlled signaling pathways. All tools will efficiently deployed to the community. In this project we are developing new ways to understand the mechanisms by which cells interpret, and in cancer misinterpret, the host of stimuli from outside and inside the cell that determine behavior. We are building molecules that can report, through light emission, the behavior of multiple key elements of the cellular “decision making circuits”, and in parallel developing new mathematical tools to interpret the output of these molecules, and to integrate this data into overall models that reveal information flow in the circuitry. We are also developing the ability to control one circuit component while watching the activity of another, enabling us to dissect out causal relationships within cellular circuits.","Integrated

"Functional Cancer Cell Maps FUNCTIONAL CANCER CELL MAPS SUMMARY I am currently an Academic Program Officer in Prof. Trey Ideker’s lab at UC San Diego. My title reflects the varied roles I play in the Ideker Lab, both scientifically and administratively, as I also serve as the Assistant Director of the Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI) and the San Diego Center for Systems Biology (SDCSB). I am involved in a wide range of research projects, both within the Ideker Lab and across the various Centers. Central though to many of these efforts is the role I play supervising a number of projects using the CRISPR/Cas9­based approach to map genetic interactions in cancer cells. These functional maps can be used to identify protein complexes and pathways in cancer cells and to reveal genetic dependencies that might be therapeutically tractable. These studies will also provide us with the necessary training data to build “visible” AIs, machine learning models that not only make accurate predictions but also provide mechanistic insights.

"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death.

"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,10223179,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Hardware ', ' computer system hardware ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Peptides ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Generations ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Chimp ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Pan Species ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Endocrine ', ' Nuclear ', ' Paracrine Signaling ', ' Paracrine Communication ', ' Peptide Hormone Gene ', ' peptide hormone ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' drug development ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Proteomics ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' mitochondrial genome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' prototype ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' genome annotation ', ' screening ', ' dark matter ', ' terabyte ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2021,1186500
"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality.

"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,10225421,R01CA211224,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Habits ', ' Incentives ', ' indexing ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Meat ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Process Measure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Lateral ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Waist-Hip Ratio ', ' waist-to-hip ratio ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' tool ', ' Body fat ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Calories ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' cancer risk ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' caloric restricted ', ' calorically restricted ', ' calorie restricted ', ' calorie restriction ', ' Caloric Restriction ', ' Dietary intake ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' High-Risk Cancer ', ' Intake ', ' Motor ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' active control ', ' cognitive training ', ' food consumption ', ' obesity treatment ', ' obesity intervention ', ' obesity therapy ', ' willingness to pay ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Obesity associated cancer ', ' Obesity related cancer ', ' cost efficient ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' treatment effect ', ' common treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' intervention effect ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' arm ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral economics ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' reduced food intake ', ' eat less ', ' reduced eating ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' weight loss program ', ' weight loss programming ', ' experimental arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' adult obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' implementation cost ', ' implementation investment ', ' overweight adults ', ' over-weight adults ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,584087
"Systems biology of quiescence entry Abstract This proposal aims to provide crucial training for the candidate’s long-term career plan to study how cellular quiescence is established through decision-making processes. The decision to undergo quiescence in response to stress or developmental signals is a fundamental and understudied property of living systems. Failure to maintain quiescence can lead to cell proliferation disorders in humans, such as fibrosis or cancer. Quiescence entry is triggered when multiple nutrient- and stress-sensing signaling pathways arrest the cell cycle machinery. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate stress response pathways with the cell cycle during quiescence remain largely unclear. This is, in part, due to the difficulties to simultaneously quantify multiple stress pathways at the single cell level in vivo. To solve this limitation, the candidate will use a microfluidics- fluorescent imaging system that tracks up to six different pathways simultaneously during the transition from proliferation into quiescence. Using this approach, the coordination between stress responses and the cell cycle machinery can be quantified with unprecedented temporal resolution in the model organism S. cerevisiae. A computational platform based on machine learning and time series analysis will be used to process the large imaging data derived from tracking six biomarkers simultaneously in single cells. An initial version of this framework found that during the onset of quiescence the nuclear levels of the conserved DNA-replication kinase Cdc7 are dynamically regulated. This approach also identified that the nuclear levels of the stress-activated transcriptional repressor Xbp1 define how the cell cycle is stopped during quiescence entry. Combining this computational approach with biochemical techniques will determine the molecular mechanisms for the establishment of cellular quiescence by modulation of stress responses and the cell cycle machinery. The candidate is to acquire crucial training in computational biology during the K99 phase of this proposal to complement his previous training in biochemistry, cell biology and yeast genetics. The candidate will be mentored by a leader in computational biology Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, whose lab develops advanced machine learning and time series analysis to study cellular signal transduction. This proposal harnesses the commitment of an entire bioinformatics core facility and the training environment of a world-class research institution at UTSW. Establishing a unique computational and imaging framework, combined with biochemical approaches for the study of quiescence, will support the candidate’s transition to an independent research academic position and will lead to the discovery of biomedically relevant principles of quiescence and cell cycle regulation. Narrative The precise integration of stress signals during the establishment of cellular quiescence is crucial to prevent cell proliferation disorders, such as fibrosis and cancer. However, it is unclear how stress responses are integrated during quiescence, in part, because of a lack of methods for simultaneously quantifying multiple stress pathways in single cells. To solve this problem, the proposed work will combine machine learning approaches with six color fluorescent microscopy to reveal the mechanisms by which stress responses coordinate

"A Comprehensive Strategy to Detect Glaucoma Worsening Earlier and With Fewer Tests ABSTRACT  This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award. The goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate with the advanced skills needed to establish an independent research program in the area of glaucoma diagnostic testing with special expertise in test error correction and predictive modeling of future glaucoma outcomes. To facilitate this long-term goal, in the current proposal, the candidate’s main research goal is to reduce the time and number of tests necessary to detect glaucoma worsening by (1) correcting for errors in previously obtained visual field (VF) and peripapillary optical coherence tomography (OCT) tests by using multilevel models with Bayesian analysis (MLB) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) (2) stratifying eyes at high and low risk for rapid glaucoma worsening at the baseline clinical visit using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). These aims are based on high quality preliminary data which show that: (1) the effect of VF reliability metrics and OCT signal strength on test error can be quantified and thus corrected for and (2) machine learning methods can predict risk of future VF progression with fair accuracy with baseline visit VF data alone and therefore adding structural (OCT) and clinical information from the baseline visit is likely to improve model accuracy. The main hypotheses of the proposed research aims are (1) correcting for test errors with MLB and GAN will reduce the time needed to detect worsening by 10 and 20% respectively (2) combining baseline visit structural (OCT), functional (VF) and clinical data as inputs into DCNNs will allow us to achieve an area under the receiver operating curve of at least 0.8 at predicting the risk of future rapid glaucoma worsening. The candidate proposes a comprehensive training plan, combining formal coursework, meetings, seminars and workshops overseen by his diverse group of mentors. Specific training goals include: (1) Receiving training in multi-level regression modeling and Bayesian analysis techniques. (2) Becoming adept at data science with a special emphasis on learning Python for data extraction, manipulation and analysis. (3) Furthering knowledge of machine learning techniques with a specific emphasis on deep learning including DCNNs and GANs. (4) Continuing training in the ethical and responsible conduct of research. The training plan will be executed in coordination with the set of research activities mentioned above. Results from this research proposal will be used to develop a subsequent R01 research proposal that will facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main aim of this study is to reduce the time and number of tests needed to accurately detect worsening of glaucoma by 1) correcting visual field and optical coherence tomography tests for errors and 2) accurately predicting future disease worsening based on baseline visit clinical, functional and structural data.

"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR .

"A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice Abstract With growing interest in personalized medicine and the rise of machine learning, constructing good risk prediction and prognostic models has been drawing renewed attention. In this development, much effort is concentrated in identifying good predictors of patient outcomes, although the same level of rigor is often absent in improving the outcome side of prediction. The majority of popular supervised techniques (e.g., regularized logistic regression and its variations), which can be readily applied in risk model development, assumes that the prediction target is a clear single outcome measured at a single time point. In clinical reality, patient outcomes are often complex, multivariate, and measured with errors. Even when a target is a relatively clear univariate outcome (e.g., death, cancer, diabetes, etc), the process that leads to this ultimate outcome often involves complex intermediate outcomes, where predicting and understanding this intermediate process can be crucial in providing effective care and preventing negative ultimate outcomes. The situation calls for a ﬂexible learning framework that can easily incorporate this important but neglected aspect in model development - better characterizing and constructing prediction targets before building prediction models.  Focusing on risk labels as prediction targets, we propose a pragmatic 3-stage learning approach, where we sequentially 1) generate latent labels, 2) validate them using explicit validators, and 3) go on with supervised learning with labeled data. Latent variable (LV) strategies used in Satge 1 have great potentials in handling complex outcome information. The unsupervised nature of LV strategies makes highly ﬂexible data synthesis and organization possible. The same nature, however, can also be seen as esoteric and subjective, which is not desirable in situations where transparency and reproducibility are of great concern such as in risk prediction. As a practical solution to this problem, we propose the use of explicit clinical validators, which not only makes LV-based labels closely aligned with contemporary science and clinical practice, but also makes it possible to automatically validate and narrow a large pool of candidate labels. With the goal of developing a practical and transparent system of learning and inference for clinical research and practice, we formed a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in latent variable modeling, machine learning, psychometrics and causal inference along with clinical/substantive expertise. Our streamlined learning framework focuses on direct and transparent validation of latent variable solutions to ensure clear communication across risk model developers, clinical researchers and practitioners. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction. Narrative This project intends to develop a pragmatic learning and risk predction framework that will facilitate utilization of multivariate data collected from research and health care services, which otherwise is underutilized in developing methods to improve personalized care of future patients. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction, and therefore will have positive impact on public health.",A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice,10212944,R01MH123443,"['Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' prognostic ', ' tool ', ' Manias ', ' Manic State ', ' Manic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' model development ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' neglect ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical risk ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' improved outcome ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' high dimensionality ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' risk prediction model ', ' data exploration ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' prognostic model ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,558490
"System Dynamics of PD-1 Signaling in T Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adaptive immune responses are governed by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, which determines the fates and activities of T cells (helper, effector, etc.). The TCR and its signaling partners integrate antigen-recognition signals and second signals, which carry information about the context in which antigen presentation is occurring. Second signals can be either stimulatory or inhibitory: stimulatory signals are essential for T cell activation, whereas inhibitory signals (also called checkpoints) are responsible for T cell exhaustion and antigen tolerance. Stimulatory second signals are generated by the innate arm of the immune system when, for example, signaling by Toll-like receptors induces expression of the B7-family ligands B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on antigen-presenting cells. Expression of B7-1/B7-2 indicates that antigen presentation is occurring within the context of an ongoing innate immune response. B7-1 and B7-2 are recognized by CD28, a TCR coreceptor that potently enhances TCR-generated T-cell activation signals. Inhibitory second signals arise during the course of chronic stimulation of TCR signaling. They are important for limiting the collateral damage caused by an immune response and avoidance of autoimmunity, but they can also be deleterious. For example, tumor cells commonly express the B7-family ligands B7-H1 (PD-L1/CD274) and B7-DC (PD- L2/CD273), which are recognized by PD-1, a TCR coreceptor that inhibits TCR-generated T-cell activation signals. B7-H1/B7-DC expression conveys immune privilege to tumor cells. For these and other reasons, it is imperative that we improve our basic understanding of checkpoint signaling. Here, we propose to characterize the dynamics of PD-1-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation in Jurkat E6-1, HuT 78, and TALL-104 cells, CRISPR-engineered cells derived from these parental cell lines, and primary human CD8+ cells. We will apply quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to obtain an unbiased, nearly comprehensive picture of phosphotyrosine (pTyr) site abundances with and without PD-1/CD28 coreceptor signaling in populations of T cells over time and across conditions. Concurrently, using fluorescence microscopy and engineered SH2 domain affinity reagents, we will characterize single-molecule patterns of multisite phosphorylation for TCR, CD28, and PD-1. We will also measure membrane-recruitment lifetimes for individual cytosolic signaling partners of these receptors. The resulting data will be used to drive the formulation and parameterization of a detailed mechanistic model for TCR signaling accounting for the effects of CD28 and PD-1 coactivation. Although PD-1 is viewed as a platform for recruitment of phosphatases that counteract activation signals from kinases, we will evaluate specific hypotheses about how PD-1 could potentially generate positive signals for T-cell activation. These hypotheses are motivated by the fact that the best characterized signaling partners of PD-1 are protein tyrosine phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2, which are known to promote cell activation in other contexts by, for example, mediating the dephosphorylation of inhibitory pTyr sites. Model predictions will be tested. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will characterize PD-1 immune checkpoint signaling dynamics in T cells by using quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, bioinformatics, and mechanistic mathematical modeling. A better basic understanding of PD-1 signaling, which plays an important role in avoidance of autoimmunity and escape of cancer cells and pathogens from immune surveillance, has the potential to motivate evaluation of new therapeutic strategies for diverse diseases.",System Dynamics of PD-1 Signaling in T Cells,10211871,R01AI153617,"['Accounting ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells

"Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement ABSTRACT Post-treatment substance use disorder (SUD) relapse rates are high (40-60% at one year), with relapse occurring early (median time to relapse 1-3 months), indicating that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Telehealth and VR technologies have the ability to greatly increase the accessibility of highly engaging recovery support. Combining these two approaches provides a unique opportunity to create a highly engaging, cost-effective take home recovery support solution targeting the critical transition from inpatient care. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its existing highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app, to develop a convenient and cost-effective integrated take-home combined VR and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) that begins in the inpatient clinic. RecoVRi is designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from inpatient to home, thereby reducing the risk of relapse and associated health and monetary costs. Sober Grid is collaborating with TRIPP, Inc. to utilize TRIPP’s immersive wellness platform. The design of the TRIPP experience leverages a large body of existing research on the use of VR technology in the mental wellness arena and utilizes proven mindfulness structures, targeted sound frequencies, visuals and interactions that have a multiplicative effect when administered through immersion. The Sober Grid Network will create a support wrapper to the VR experience that facilitates access to crisis management experts and community for the person in early recovery. The unique combination of a personalized and targeted self-regulation toolkit and community and professional support is a key differentiator for this service. In phase I of the project, we will develop and pilot test a proof-of-concept RecoVRi VR-mindfulness protocol and intervention to ascertain feasibility and acceptability (Aim 1). In phase II of the project, a production-quality intervention will be developed with new VR content created by the TRIPP development team specifically targeting themes supporting recovery from alcohol, stimulant and opioid SUD separately (Aim 2). We will then test post-treatment recovery support engagement in the RecoVRi intervention in comparison to treatment as usual in a randomized comparison trial involving 80 patients receiving inpatient treatment and transitioning to the home setting (Aim 3). Over the span of both phases, we will seek regulatory guidance from the FDA in order to attain clearance for use of the RecoVRi intervention as a therapeutic medical device (Aim 4). NARRATIVE Substance use treatment research findings indicate that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app to develop and test a convenient and cost-effective, integrated, take-home combined, virtual reality and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from the inpatient clinic to home.",Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement,10209530,R44DA050222,"['Preparation ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' mindfulness ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' peer coaching ', ' peer instruction ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer support ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' Android ', ' relapse prediction ', ' predict relapse ', ' relapse risk ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Immersion ', ' treatment research ', ' acceptability and feasibility ', ' substance use treatment ', ' feasibility testing ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' Home ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Communities ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Inpatients ', ' Medical Device ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Production ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Scientist ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' sound frequency ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' treatment program ', ' member ', ' sober ', ' sobriety ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' virtual reality ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' telehealth ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' ']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2021,840913
"Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is distinctive amongst the inflammatory/autoimmune joint diseases in that its onset is commonly preceded by cutaneous psoriasis (PsC). This provides an unparalleled opportunity for the identification of predictive biomarkers to determine which of the approximately 25% of psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) patients will develop PsA. Over the past decade, we have expanded our genetic study of PsV to focus on PsA, resulting in the collection of 1,279 PsA patients at Michigan, 743 of whom have already been subjected to GWAS. Initiated in 2007, the International Psoriatic Arthritis Research Team (IPART) has accumulated 1,919 Canadian PsA patients, of whom 1,370 have already been subjected to GWAS. In 2015, we completed a meta- GWAS of PsC and PsA involving a discovery cohort of 1,430 PsA cases and 1,417 controls, with 9,293 additional PsV replication samples (3,061 PsA, 3,110 PsC) and 13,670 controls. We detected 10 associations for PsA and 11 for PsC, as well as a new association for PsV. Utilizing an innovative core exome array to genotype additional cases and controls, we carried out the largest meta-GWAS of PsV to date (~40,000 subjects) and found 16 more susceptibility regions, highlighting the roles of interferon signaling and the NFB cascade, and demonstrating strong enrichment for psoriasis genetic signals in T-cell regulatory elements. Using machine learning to model ~200 genetic variants in our PsA vs. PsC GWAS, we achieved 82% area under receiver operator curve for distinguishing PsA vs PsC, with 98% accuracy among the top 10% of patients with the highest genetic load. We also carried out RNA-seq on mRNA and miRNA from 65 pairs of pre- and post-conversion samples from PsC patients who developed PsA. Suggestive of a shift from skin- focused to systemic autoimmunity, we found significant post-conversion enrichment for central memory CD4+ T-cell (CD4-Tcm) transcripts among the up-regulated genes. We also observed highly correlated pre- and post- conversion behaviors of 54 differentially-expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets, as well as multiple serum miRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed in PsA vs. PsC. A metabolomic study of 50 paired converter sera revealed 293 biochemicals with significant alterations, 275 of which were increased. Finally, we identified noncoding eQTLs for IL23R that correlate strikingly with a region of selective PsA association.  Based on these results, we hypothesize that PsA and PsC have pathogenetic mechanisms that are T-cell, osteoblast and osteoclast-driven and progress from skin to systemic during transition to PsA. We propose that this paradigm can be used to develop a useful test to predict PsA in PsC patients, while increasing our basic understanding of PsA. To test this hypothesis, we propose four aims: (1) to maintain and grow our longitudinal clinical resource; (2) To identify biomarkers for the development of PsA in PsC patients; (3) To integrate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2 into a clinically-useful tool for PsA identification using machine learning ; and (4) to explore the mechanisms by which the IL23R gene contributes to PsA pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. The mechanisms that predispose patients with psoriasis to develop PsA are unknown. The proposed research will utilize the power of genome-wide association studies, transcriptome analysis, metabolomics, and the largest longitudinal resource of PsA in the world to develop a clinically-relevant tool for PsA prediction and to address a major gap in our mechanistic understanding of the causes of PsA.

"Determining the scope of prenylatable protein sequences PROJECT SUMMARY This study investigates the specificity of farnesyl transferase (FTase) that isoprenylates CaaX proteins. Studies probing the in vivo activity of the FTase have historically used reporters (e.g. Ras GTPases) that undergo complex multi-step post-translational modification (PTM), involving initial farnesylation followed by CaaX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. This study takes advantage of Hsp40 Ydj1, a farnesylation-only reporter for which we have developed a range of methods to monitor its PTM status. Its use reveals that farnesylation is not necessarily coupled to subsequent PTMs as has been generally accepted for CaaX proteins, and that FTase specificity is significantly more promiscuous than anticipated. These findings challenge the conventional paradigm for how farnesylated proteins are modified and which proteins are targeted by FTase. We will extend our studies to fully resolve the specificity of FTase using a combination of genetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, and biophysical studies. We bring to bear on our investigations an exceptionally strong set of preliminary findings, the complementary expertise of several research groups, and a comprehensive molecular toolbox for the study of farnesylated proteins and other enzymes associated with this post-translational modification pathway. PROJECT NARRATIVE Farnesylated proteins are intimately involved in disease. This project investigates the target specificity of the farnesyl transferase that mediates protein farnesylation.

"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10218158,R01DK125414,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Persons ', ' Terminology ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' cancer risk ', ' Intercept ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Health Promotion Sciences ', ' Measurable ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Diet Monitoring ', ' dietary monitoring ', ' cost effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' Consumption ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' weight loss therapy ', ' weight loss treatment ', ' analytical tool ', ' Health behavior change ', ' effective intervention ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' control theory ', ' rate of change ', ' exercise intervention ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' relapse risk ', ' intervention cost ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' Cardiometabolic Disease ', ' Cardiometabolic Disorder ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,510240
"Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Abstract Candidate's Career Goals: Dr. Han has a strong background in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, image reconstruction and arterial spin labeling (ASL), with a Ph.D. in bio and brain engineering. Dr. Han is currently at a junior-faculty rank of instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). His goal is to expand his future career to multi-modality positron emission tomography (PET)-MR imaging for translational research and clinical improvement. His long-term goal is to become an independent, accomplished investigator that can lead future scientific and clinical imaging projects taking full advantage of multi-modality PET-MR imaging. Career Development Plan: Foundational training in PET/PET-MR imaging as well as neurology is proposed for the candidate, an area that the candidate currently lacks knowledge and experience in. The candidate plans to engage in formal course work/seminars, research via one-on-one instructions with mentors and collaborators, conferences/presentations, manuscript/grant preparations, and teaching/leadership roles to grow as an independent investigator in the field of PET-MR imaging and neurology. Research Project: The overall goal of the proposed research is to take advantage of simultaneous dynamic PET and ASL-MR imaging to estimate the permeability surface product (PS) of the PET tracer, which is new physiological information that cannot be obtained with PET or MR alone. PS describes the unidirectional flux rate of macromolecules from the blood plasma into the interstitial space of cellular tissue and is the key metric for assessing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Knowing the PS of the PET tracer provides powerful capability to probe the physiological delivery process of essential macromolecules involved in the pathogenesis of diseases in relation to BBB, due to the theoretically unlimiting potential in the design of radioactive analogs of important biological compounds. We plan to develop a PET tracer PS mapping method, achieve the first phantom and human study with PS mapping, and study the changes in the spatial distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and amyloid-beta (Aß) plaque depositions in relation to the BBB integrity changes with pathological events associated with the progression of AD, by performing dynamic-PET/mPLD-ASL studies using 18F-T807 and 11C- Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET tracers on AD and normal subjects. Environment: MGH provides an ideal setting for conducting research in MR, PET, and PET-MR imaging since multiple state-of-the-art imaging systems are available for preclinical/clinical MR scanners and preclinical simultaneous PET-MR scanners. There is a dynamic flow phantom designed to simulate blood flow for two compartment pharmacokinetics and an MR-compatible pump and detection system for continuous blood sampling suitable for performing ASL flow and PET imaging studies with arterial sampling. Also, there is a shared memory supercomputer ideal for the image reconstruction proposed in the project. MGH is also home to many experts in both PET-MR imaging and neurology who can provide their expertise to this project.

"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis

"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,10138019,R01HL152735,"['airway obstruction ', ' airflow limitation ', ' airflow obstruction ', ' airway limitation ', ' obstructed airflow ', ' obstructed airway ', ' alpha 1-Antitrypsin ', ' A1PI ', ' alpha 1 Antiprotease ', ' alpha 1-Antiproteinase ', ' alpha 1-Antitrypsin Trypsin Inhibitor ', ' alpha 1-Protease Inhibitor ', ' alpha 1-Proteinase Inhibitor ', ' α1-Antitrypsin ', ' α1-Proteinase Inhibitor ', ' Biology ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' Emphysema ', ' emphysematous ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Repression ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Spirometry ', ' Technology ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' prognostic ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Genetic ', ' Smoker ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Tobacco smoke ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Proteomics ', ' single molecule ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Transcript ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' chronic airflow obstruction ', ' chronic airflow limitation ', ' chronic airway obstruction ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' protein metabolite ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Jackson Heart Study ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ', ' TOPMed ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' soluble RAGE ', ' sRAGE ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,759026
"Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States. Current standard protocols for wound management do not guarantee healing and focus on maintaining a wound environment that is conducive to passive self-healing. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative treatments that promote active healing and shorten healing time leading to reduced costs. We have previously reported that treatment with low-frequency (20-100 kHz), low-intensity (50-150 mW/cm2) ultrasound (LFLI US) significantly (p<0.03) reduces venous ulcer size in vivo as compared to wounds treated with a sham device. This proposal aims at determining the biological mechanisms by which LFLI US promotes chronic wound healing in vitro. There is evidence that the cause of impaired healing is the dysregulation of macrophage phenotype, especially the defective transition from pro- inflammatory (M1) to pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Our characterization of tissue debrided from chronic wounds has shown that healing chronic wounds contain higher proportions of M1-like than M2- like macrophages. Additionally, the signaling protein Rac2, downstream of integrin and focal adhesion kinase activation, is a key regulator of mechanotransduction in macrophages and facilitates the transition of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. The proposed study will systematically examine the effects of LFLI ultrasound on macrophage phenotype, using macrophages cultured in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. We hypothesize that LFLI US directly and indirectly stimulates the transition of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-healing M2 macrophages via Rac2. This project will enhance our understanding of chronic wound healing and the potential of therapeutic ultrasound to accelerate healing. Aim 1 will elucidate the direct effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype by treating inflammatory macrophages directly with LFLI US and characterizing functional changes (proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis), protein/cytokine secretion, and gene expression. Concurrently, we will validate Rac2 as the potential mechanotransduction pathway which promotes M1 to M2 macrophages transition by analyzing integrins, focal adhesion kinases, and Rac2 via confocal microscopy and RNA characterization. [Aim 2 will validate the in vitro findings from Aim 1 using our previously developed diagnostic M1/M2 score on debrided tissue from chronic wound patients treated with LFLI US.] Aim 3 will elucidate the indirect effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype via a 3D macrophage fibroblast co-culture. The results of this study will inform the optimal design of LFLI ultrasound therapy protocols, lead to a personalized, active treatment for chronic wounds, accelerate chronic wound healing, and contribute to reduced annual wound care costs. Project Narrative Chronic wounds currently affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States and an excess of 25 billion dollars is spent annually on treatment. Current standards of care for chronic wounds, including months of weekly re-dressings and debridement, fails to guarantee active wound healing or closure. To address this issue, we propose to determine the biological mechanism responsible for therapeutic ultrasound mediated healing, low-intensity (<100mW/cm2), low-frequency (20kHz) ultrasound that has been shown to accelerate chronic wound closure in pilot clinical studies.","Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound",10137782,F31AR074847,"['Adhesions ', ' Affect ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Debridement ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Exhibits ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Integrins ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' macrophage ', ' Mφ ', ' Patients ', ' Phagocytosis ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Ultrasonic Therapy ', ' ultrasound energy ', ' ultrasound therapy ', ' United States ', ' Varicose Ulcer ', ' Venous Ulcer ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 ', ' PTK2 Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 ', ' endogenous substrate pp120 ', ' focal adhesion kinase ', ' focal adhesion protein tyrosine kinase ', ' focal adhesion-associated protein tyrosine kinase pp125FAK ', ' cytokine ', ' Mediating ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Stimulus ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Co-culture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Coculture ', ' Therapeutic ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Inflammatory ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Diagnostic ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Frequencies ', ' human tissue ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Diabetic wound ', ' diabetes ulcer ', ' diabetic skin wound ', ' diabetic ulcer ', ' rac2 gene product ', ' rac2 protein ', ' rac2 GTP-binding protein ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Self Heal ', ' Xiakucao ', ' Prunella vulgaris ', ' Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Signaling Pathway Gene ', ' Signaling Protein ', ' Address ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' active method ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' Chronic Care ', ' migration ', ' alternative treatment ', ' chronic wound ', ' chronic skin wound ', ' three dimensional cell culture ', ' 3D cell culture ', ' 3D culture ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanosensing ', ' wound closure ', ' care costs ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' wound care ', ' wound assessment ', ' wound monitoring ', ' wound treatment ', ' treat wound ', ' wound management ', ' wound therapeutics ', ' wound therapy ', ' wound environment ', ' Impaired healing ', ' Healing abnormal ', ' Healing delayed ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIAMS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal focuses on the challenge of identifying drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer’s Disease. The foundation of this work is the ReFRAME library, a set of ~13,000 compounds that includes nearly all small molecules that have been FDA-approved, reached clinical development, or undergone significant preclinical profiling. The ReFRAME library is being actively screened against a diverse cross-section of in vitro assays. This proposal pursues three distinct strategies for identifying repositioning candidates among the ReFRAME collection. First, we will create and mine a large and heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph. We will use machine learning methods to identify repositioning candidates based on properties of the knowledge graph surrounding and joining each drug and disease. Second, we will mine a massive data set of insurance claims data for associations between drug use and the incidence or severity of Alzheimer’s Disease. Containing almost 7 billion medical claims and over 2 billion pharmacy claims, this data set represents the largest source of claims data available. Third, we will use concept of gene expression complementarity to identify repositioning candidates. We will generate a gene expression signature for every ReFRAME compound in three cell lines relevant to Alzheimer’s Disease, and we will screen for compounds that produce a signature that appear to reverse gene expression changes seen in Alzheimer’s Disease. After assembling repositioning candidates identified through all three of these methods, we will prioritize up to 100 compounds (or compound combinations) for further characterization and validation. These follow-up experiments will initially investigate the activity of these compounds in five cell-based assays to establish a mechanistic hypothesis on their mechanism of action in Alzheimer’s Disease. Secondary follow-up experiments may include validation in some combination of in vitro (including hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons and/or organoids) and in vivo systems. We believe that the multifaceted approach described in this proposal offers the best possible chance at successfully identifying AD repositioning candidates. Moreover, this work will create methods and resources that will be useful to the broader scientific community, both for Alzheimer’s Disease and for other disease areas. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project focuses on discovering new treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. We specifically are looking for drugs that are already approved (or were previously tested) to treat other diseases to see if they can be beneficial for Alzheimer’s Disease patients. We will make and test predictions about which chemical compounds will have benefit, either alone or in combination.","Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity",10137167,R01AG066750,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blue Cross ', ' Blue Shield ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organoids ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' medication prescription ', ' prescribed medication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Graph ', ' validation studies ', ' Property ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Output ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' FDA approved ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' screening ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical development ', ' preclinical development ', ' pre-clinical development ', ' insurance claims ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', "" Alzheimer's disease diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", ' ']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,886543
"Proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma Project Summary  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and therapeutic options are limited. There is a pressing need to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease in order to identify new effective biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC. Proteins are the functional molecules of the cell, and many clinically validated biomarkers and most drug targets are proteins; however, cancer omics studies have relied primarily on genomic platforms. By melding genomics with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the new field of proteogenomics provides an opportunity to more completely understand how somatic genomes activate aberrant protein networks that drive cancer pathogenesis. A major National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded initiative, the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the more recently established International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC), are promoting an integrated proteogenomics approach that is postulated to produce sounder therapeutic hypotheses and a new generation of protein biomarkers. The central purpose of this application is to forge a collaboration between a CPTAC team in the US and an ICPC team in China to enable proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discoveries in hepatitis B virus-related (HBV+) HCC, which attributes to 85% of HCC cases in China. The two teams bring complementary expertise required for a successful proteogenomic study of HCC. The China team has already generated the most comprehensive multi-omics dataset yet produced for liver cancer by applying proteogenomic profiling to a Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort (CHCC-HBV) with 159 cases, and the data has been preliminarily analyzed through collaborative efforts between the two teams. In this application, the US team will perform deep computational analyses of the proteogenomics data to generate prognostic models and therapeutic hypotheses, which will be experimentally validated in cell lines, animal models, and clinical specimens by the China team. Our specific Aims are: Aim 1) To develop and validate a protein-based prognostic model; Aim 2) To identify and validate subtype-specific causal drivers and therapeutic strategies; and Aim 3) To characterize the immune landscape of HBV+ HCC. Successful completion of this project will lead to new knowledge on HCC biology as well as new prognostic and treatment strategies for HBV+ HCC. Meanwhile, experimentally validated computational methods developed in this project will have wide application to the study of other cancers and other non-cancer diseases.

This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects. (This technology and these methods will be managed and executed by the TR&D1 framework to distributed datasets totaling over 10,000 subjects). Lastly, our TR&D3 (Intrinsic Surface Mapping) develops a general framework for surface mapping in the high dimensional Laplace-Beltrami embedding space via the mathematical optimization of their Riemannian metric. Our approach here overcomes fundamental limitations in existing methods based on spherical registration by eliminating the metric distortion during the parameterization step, thus achieving much improved accuracy in mapping brain anatomy. Coupled with a mature and efficient administrative structure and comprehensive training and dissemination, this program serves a wide and important need in the scientific community.

"The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This U24 application is written in response to RFA-AT-20-003 to establish a high-priority research network on emotional well-being (EWB). While psychological research on well-being has dramatically increased over the past 15 years, virtually all of this work has been descriptive and has not emphasized the “how” of well-being: How might well-being be cultivated? In addition, virtually all of the extant work on the correlates of individual differences in well-being has used responses on retrospective questionnaires as the primary tool to assess well-being. While there have been exciting findings, particularly relating individual differences in well-being to various indices of physical health, many questions remain and methodological limitations plague the validity of this work. This U24 network will assemble a highly multi-disciplinary group of 10 investigators across 3 (or more in the future) institutions to significantly advance our understanding of the “how” of EWB, identify the core plastic constituents of EWB, specify and/or develop robust measures of these constituents at biological, behavioral and experiential levels of analysis and characterize the plasticity of these constituents. The measurement strategy will ultimately focus on the development of technology-based passive measures of EWB that require no explicit user input and are highly scalable. The network will also focus its efforts on the development and evaluation of programs to train EWB and will assess whether such programs might serve as prevention strategies. The network will consist of scientists and scholars from a broad range of fields including psychology, neuroscience, electrical and computer engineering, population health and biology, computer science and the humanities. These scientists and scholars will focus on the following major aims: Aim 1: To arrive at a core consensus of the minimal set of constituents that can be described and measured at biological, behavioral and experiential levels that constitute the plastic elements of EWB and to specify already existing measures and /or develop novel measures of each of these constructs at each level of analysis. Aim 2: Using the active measures described in Aim 1, to develop passive measures using digital technologies of at least two of the core constituents of well-being. Aim 3: To develop pilot projects specifically focusing on prevention strategies for learning well-being in various samples. The network will train new investigators and bring established investigators into this new field, disseminate a framework for understanding the plasticity of well- being, a toolbox of measures for assessing the plasticity of components of well-being, and several pilot datasets that showcase the novel passive and field-friendly biological measures. In these ways, the network will dramatically accelerate progress in the nascent field of EWB. PROJECT NARRATIVE This U24 network on emotional well-being (EWB) will catalyze the emerging field of the plasticity of well-being and will showcase how well-being can be learned and the consequences of such skill development on physical and emotional health and on prevention of disease. A framework for understanding how well-being can be learned along with measures of the core components of well-being that can be learned will be developed and disseminated. The network will also train new investigators in this area and will engage established investigators to contribute to this field.","The plasticity of well-being:  A research network to define, measure and promote human flourishing",10151850,U24AT011289,"['Program Evaluation ', ' Psychology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' meetings ', ' computer science ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Population Biology ', ' Subgroup ', ' To specify ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' Individual Differences ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' standard measure ', ' mindfulness meditation ', ' population health ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Humanities ', ' indexing ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U24,2021,620542
"Interplay of inherent promiscuity and specificity in protein biochemical function with applications to drug discovery and exome analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Although the past two decades witnessed the large-scale analyses of cellular components, e.g. exomes, their impact on drug discovery and precision medicine has been modest. For example, 6/7 drug candidates failed safety and 3/4 failed efficacy in recent FDA clinical trials. These unsolved, but related issues, safety and efficacy, reflect significant gaps in understanding of the triangular interrelationship between diseases, molecular function, and drug treatments. A key conceptual limitation of contemporary drug discovery is the often implicitly assumed single drug for a single protein target disease model. In reality, most diseases are caused by multiple malfunctioning molecules. Whether it be disease treatment or precision medicine diagnostics, there is often an inability to identify disease-associated mode of action (MOA) proteins. To begin to address these issues, in the current MIRA proposal, we developed a promising protein structure and network-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach, MEDICASCY, to predict disease-associated MOA proteins, drug indications, side effects and efficacy; however, much more needs to be done. Here, we propose to build on our successes and develop an integrated AI-based approach, MEDICASCY-X, that addresses the following: The first step in determining a drug’s MOA and off-target interactions is to identity its protein targets. This requires the structures of all human proteins and their complexes. While we predicted suitable models for at least one domain in 97% of human proteins, using deep learning, we will predict the structures of the missing domains, domain-domain orientations and protein- protein complexes. We will extend small molecule virtual ligand screening (VLS) to predict binding affinities based on the insight that interacting ring-protein subpocket geometries and chemistry are conserved across protein families, are often privileged chemical structures and are likely low free energy complexes. Cryptic protein pockets, recently recognized as important drug targets, will be predicted and included in our VLS approach. Antibody-based immunotherapies are powerful but have similar safety and efficacy issues as small-molecules; thus, their safety and efficacy will be predicted by MEDICASCY-X. While MEDICASCY works on an “averaged human”, MEDICASCY-X will consider individual genetic and epigenetic profiles to make it a true precision medicine tool. We will predict which MOA proteins should be targeted and if a protein’s MOA is due to a loss or gain of function. The same framework will predict synergistic drug-drug interactions. Another way to prioritize MOA proteins is by disease comorbidity: proteins occurring in multiple diseases are likely important. If disease comorbidity can be predicted, we will construct the “Phylogenetic” Tree(s) of Diseases that would facilitate a deeper understanding of disease interrelationships. As proof of principle of the effectiveness of the algorithms being developed, novel preclinical treatments for a variety of intractable diseases will be developed. Thus, this project could enhance the success rates of drug discovery and precision medicine while reducing time and cost. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the explosion of biological knowledge that has occurred since the turn of the century, the impact on drug discovery and precision medicine has been modest. To address the key issues limiting this success, this project will develop an AI-driven, integrated protein structure and interaction network-based approach, MEDICASCY-X, that will predict disease associated proteins, identify the most effective protein targets to treat the disease and suggest effective, de-risked therapeutic strategies. MEDICASCY-X will be applied to improve drug discovery and precision medicine and will be validated by developing novel preclinical treatments for a variety of intractable diseases.",Interplay of inherent promiscuity and specificity in protein biochemical function with applications to drug discovery and exome analysis,10149528,R35GM118039,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Chemistry ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Explosion ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Ligands ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' cryptic protein ', ' success ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein complex ', ' Effectiveness ', ' small molecule ', ' Protein Family ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Affinity ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Molecular ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Network-based ', ' gain of function ', ' drug candidate ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Geometry ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' deep learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,490958
"Dissecting the mechanism of cell migration at the systems level Project Summary/Abstract Cell migration is required for many important physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancerous invasion. As a process that involves concerted action of multiple ensembles of molecules over the length of the entire cell, cell migration cannot be understood using conventional molecular approaches alone without considering sensing, actuation, and control at the whole cell level. This project seeks to approach migrating cells in a top-down manner as an integrated mechanochemical system. Based on observations that likely represent the manifestation of a complex network of molecular interactions, we may deduct how the underlying machine operates. The project will be facilitated by the development of new technologies, including 3D printing of polyacrylamide hydrogels and machine learning for cell tracking, traction force microscopy, and super resolution imaging. We will address three important aspects. First, we will ask how cells initiate migration through a process known as symmetry breaking, which causes a symmetrically spreading cell to initiate directional migration. We will examine various anisotropic properties of the substrate as potential symmetry breaking cues. In addition, the function of filopodia as possible sensors for symmetry breaking will be studied with imaging and pharmacological approaches. Second, we will address several poorly understood aspects of 2D and 3D cell migration. By following migrating cells over a long distance at a high magnification, we expect to place the newly discovered process of contact following in the context of cell collectives. To understand how cell shape control, cell-cell interaction, and cell migration respond to 3D environment, we will use 3D printed polyacrylamide to create model systems and systematically vary geometrical and mechanical parameters. We will then extend the experiments to decellularized lung scaffolds, which have been used for tissue engineering, to determine how migration characteristics in 3D is related to the promotion of tissue formation. Another overlooked area we will examine is the function of the tail in defining cell polarity and mediating contact following. Third, we will seek mechanistic understanding of cellular responses to cyclic stretching, which occurs in various tissues. A novel imaging approach will allow us to determine the responses during the stretching and relaxation phase respectively. A combination of experimentation and computer modeling is planned to explain why epithelial cells respond to static stretching along the direction of forces but perpendicularly in response to cyclic stretching. We will also test the hypothesis that responses to cyclic stretching can cause cell intercalation, a fundamentally important process in embryonic morphogenesis. We expect our results to complement studies at the molecular level and bring paradigm shifting insights into cell migration for both basic cell biology and repair of tissue functions. Project Narrative This project seeks to fill important gaps of knowledge in cell migration, which is essential for many physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancerous invasion. We will use a top-down approach that treats migrating cells as an integrated mechanical system, and we are developing technologies such as 3D printing and artificial intelligence for fabricating experimental environments, following cell movements, and imaging interactions in 3D scaffolds. Knowledge in how migrating cells interact with the environment and with each other is expected to further our abilities to counter diseases and restore body functions.",Dissecting the mechanism of cell migration at the systems level,10153827,R35GM136345,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cues ', ' Deductibles ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Environment ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Relaxation ', ' Tail ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' polyacrylamide ', ' Cell Polarity ', ' cellular polarity ', ' Mediating ', ' polyacrylamide hydrogels ', ' Cell Shape ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' insight ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' Stretching ', ' Filopodia ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Resolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' migration ', ' Cancerous ', ' intercalation ', ' tissue repair ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' Traction Force Microscopy ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,339635
"Creating a foundation for personalized age- and sex-based immune-targeted therapies from an ALS longitudinal cohort by identifying peripheral and central immune signatures ABSTRACT The immune system contributes to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression and survival, and therapies to target the immune system are of burgeoning interest. However, the changes in the immune system during the course of ALS and the sex-specific alterations in immune function warrant a more in depth analysis in order to develop personalized ALS therapies and biomarkers. The long-term goals are to harness the immune sys- tem’s potential to slow and stop the progression of ALS. The overall objective is to determine how peripheral immune profiles, sex, age, and sex hormones, link to neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and ALS progres- sion and survival. The central hypothesis is that peripheral immune profiles are an important pathophysiologic agent of ALS progression and survival; that sex, age and sex hormone levels impact these profiles; and that insight into ALS patient-specific immune profiles will yield new drug targets and therapeutic windows. Our ra- tionale is that linking patient-specific immune cell profiles to ALS progression and survival will facilitate person- alized immunomodulatory therapeutic development for ALS and identify potential treatment windows. The cen- tral hypothesis will be pursued with three aims: 1) Identify specific immune profiles that associate with ALS pro- gression and survival rates.; 2) Evaluate the effects of sex hormones on ALS immune profiles, progression, and survival; and 3) Identify immune profiles and corresponding cellular pathways that are most toxic to neu- rons and that associate with central inflammation. In Aim 1 longitudinal immunophenotyping of peripheral blood samples from ALS subjects will generate composite immune profiles that will then be linked to ALS subject characteristics, progression, and survival. Aim 2 will determine if observed sex-dependent associations be- tween immune profiles and ALS progression and survival are mediated by sex hormones, as sex hormones can alter immune profiles. Aim 3 will enrich a cohort of ALS subjects by immune profile clusters; their periph- eral immune populations will be analyzed using 1) RNA-seq and 2) cell toxicity studies via co-cultures with iPSC-derived neurons; subjects will also have positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to quantify central neuroinflammation. Datasets will be synthesized to build prediction models and create deep neural networks capable of associating immune profiles with sex, age, disease severity, progression, and survival The research proposed is innovative, in the applicants’ opinion, because it rigorously examines the effects of sex, age, and sex hormone levels on immune cells and ALS progression and survival in a longitudinal study. It also accounts for the interactions between immune cells by forming immune profiles for individual subjects and assesses how specific profiles associate with dysregulated pathways, cytotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. The proposed re- search is significant because it will provide critical data on the distinct immune profiles and pathways associ- ated with ALS progression and survival in a sex-, age- and sex hormone- specific fashion. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying the alterations in the im- mune system that impact amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and also focuses on identifying whether these altered immune profiles are influenced by sex- and age-specific factors. The development of such strategies will greatly advance the ability to develop personalized treatment approaches for persons with ALS based on immunomodulatory drugs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission that pertains to developing the fundamental knowledge about the nervous system and using that knowledge to reduce the bur- den of

"Interpretable deep learning models for translational medicine Understanding the state of cellular signaling systems provides insights to how cells behave under physiological and pathological conditions. Cellular signaling systems are organized as hierarchy (cascade) and signals of a molecular is often compositionally encoded to control cellular processes, such as gene expression. This project aims to develop advanced deep learning models (DLMs) to simulate cellular signaling systems based on gene expression data. In last 3 years, the project has made significant progresses, but the challenges remain. Importantly, contemporary DLMs behave as “black boxes”, in that it is difficult to interpret how signals are encoded and how to interpret which signal a hidden node represent in a DLM. This black-box nature prevents researchers from gaining biological insights using DLMs, even though these models can be much superior in modeling data than other types of models in many tasks, e.g., predicting drug sensitivity of cancer cells. In this competitive renewal, we propose to develop novel DLMs and innovative inference algorithms to train “interpretable” DLMs and apply them in translational research. The proposed research is innovative and of high significance in several perspectives: 1) Our novel DLMs and algorithms take advantage of big data resulting from systematic chemical/genetic perturbations of cellular signaling machinery, so that we can use the perturbation condition as side information to reveal how signals are encoded in a DLM. 2) We integrate principles of causal inference and information theory with deep learning method to make DLMs interpretable. As results, that researchers can gain mechanistic insights from such models. 3) Innovative application of interpretable DLMs will advance translational research. For example, we will train interpretable DLMs to model cellular signaling at the level of single cells and use this information investigate inter-cellular interactions among cells in tumor microenvironment to shed light on immune evasion mechanisms of cancers. We will also use information derived from interpretable DLMs to predict cancer cell drug sensitivity.

"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,10171859,R01EY028667,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complication ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal ', ' Corneal Diseases ', ' Corneal Disorder ', ' cornea disorder ', ' Keratoplasty ', ' Cornea Transplantation ', ' Corneal Grafting ', ' Corneal Transplantation ', ' corneal keratoplasty ', ' corneal transplant ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pathological Dilatation ', ' Ectasia ', ' Pathologic Dilatation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Keratoconus ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surgical Flaps ', ' Flaps ', ' Island Flaps ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Procedures ', ' Surgical incisions ', ' Otomy ', ' incision ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' LASIK ', ' Laser Intrastromal Keratomileuses ', ' Laser Intrastromal Keratomileusis ', ' Laser-Assisted Stromal In Situ Keratomileusis ', ' Laser In Situ Keratomileusis ', ' Property ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Torsion ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' Outcome ', ' human study ', ' data acquisition ', ' treatment effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' mechanical properties ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' detection sensitivity ', ' ']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,381543
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,10167620,U19AI136053,"['Affect ', ' Allergens ', ' Anaphylaxis ', ' Anaphylactic Reaction ', ' Anaphylactic Shock ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Diet therapy ', ' dietary therapy ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergic to food ', ' Allergy to food ', ' Food Allergy ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' IgE ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Milk ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Urticaria ', ' Hives ', ' Measures ', ' Milk Hypersensitivity ', ' Milk Allergy ', ' allergic to milk ', ' allergy to milk ', ' Schedule ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Funding ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Phase III Clinical Trials ', ' Phase 3 Clinical Trials ', ' phase III protocol ', ' Exposure to ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Reaction ', ' Visit ', ' Egg Hypersensitivity ', ' allergic to eggs ', ' egg allergy ', ' Allergy to eggs ', ' Groundnut Hypersensitivity ', ' Peanut Hypersensitivity ', ' allergic to peanuts ', ' peanut allergy ', ' Allergy to peanuts ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Allergic ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' food allergen ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' oral diagnostics ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' neglect ', ' desensitization ', ' analytical tool ', ' egg ', ' Network-based ', ' prototype ', ' clinical care ', ' FDA approved ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' allergic response ', ' allergen response ', ' allergy response ', ' T cell response ', ' food challenge ', ' oral immunotherapy ', ' screening ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' Antibody Response ', ' learning network ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' high dimensionality ', ' immunotherapy trials ', ' intervention cost ', ' data tools ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,1745202
"T4SS effectors and tick tropism in Anaplasma phagocytolium Project Summary  Tick-borne diseases are on the increase, and are responsible for nearly all of the vector-transmitted disease in the US. Vector-borne pathogens face the dual challenge of adaptation to two very different host environments: the arthropod vector and the mammalian host. To survive within eukaryotic cells, the rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum blocks phago-lysosome maturation, inhibits apoptosis, modulates host gene expression, redirects trans-Golgi trafficking, and repurposes autophagic machinery to build a replication vacuole. A. phagocytophilum must accomplish this, all while evading the unique innate immune defenses of mammalian and arthropod host cells. All pathogens in the order Rickettsiales utilize a specialized Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) to deliver effector molecules into the host cell cytosol to mediate host pathogen interactions. However, identification of the secreted effectors has been limited by the obligate nature of these pathogens. Even less is known about how effectors contribute to rickettsial growth in tick cells, as the tick vector remains an understudied niche of these pathogens. To overcome this, our group has developed a T4SS effector prediction program Optimal-features Predictor for T4SS Effectors (OPT4e). When applied to A. phagocytophilum, OPT4e identified 48 putative T4SS effectors. Transcriptomics finds that 15 of these predicted effector genes are specifically expressed during growth within either tick or mammalian cells. We have demonstrated that one of these tick- specific effector candidates, Aph1383, is translocated in a T4 specific manner by the Legionella pneumophila T4SS. Aph1383 also belongs to a paralogous family of six proteins encoded by the gene cluster aph1380-1386. This entire cluster is expressed 2.5-fold more highly during A. phagocytophilum growth in tick cells than during mammalian cell infections. We hypothesize that this family of Aph1383 paralogs are all T4SS effectors which target host cell processes specifically important for A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. In this study, we will first use transposon insertion mutants in the aph1380-1386 gene cluster to test the fitness contribution of these genes during A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. Next, we will evaluate the T4SS translocation of all Aph1383 paralogs and identify the amino acid sequences necessary for secretion. Finally, we will identify the subcellular localization and molecular targets of Aph1383 within tick cells. Characterizing these molecular interactions of A. phagocytophilum within the tick cell will open the door to development of vector targeted interventions to reduce transmissibility of the pathogen. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases account for >17% of the global burden of all infectious diseases. The ability of the tick-borne rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum to manipulate the cell biology of both mammalian and tick cells is achieved through delivery of effector molecules by a specialized secretion system. This project investigates how a family of tick specific effectors enables A. phagocytophilum to survive and replicate within tick cells.",T4SS effectors and tick tropism in Anaplasma phagocytolium,10174737,R21AI154023,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Anaplasma ', ' Arthropod Vectors ', ' Arthropods ', ' Arthropoda ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Cytosol ', ' Environment ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Gene Cluster ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Golgi Apparatus ', ' Golgi ', ' Golgi Complex ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Infection ', ' Legionella pneumophila ', ' L pneumophila ', ' L. pneumophila ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Parasites ', ' Phagolysosome ', ' Proteins ', ' Rickettsia ', ' Rickettsiales ', ' Salivary Glands ', ' Salivary Glands Head and Neck ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Ticks ', ' Ixodida ', ' Transfection ', ' United States ', ' Vacuole ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Mediating ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Tick-Borne Diseases ', ' tick-borne illness ', ' tickborne disease ', ' tickborne illness ', ' Biochemical ', ' Midgut ', ' Tropism ', ' A phagocytophila ', ' A phagocytophilum ', ' A. phagocytophila ', ' A. phagocytophilum ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophila ', ' Cytoecetes phagocytophila ', ' Ehrlichia equi ', ' Ehrlichia phagocytophila ', ' HGE Agent ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophilum ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' mutant ', ' trafficking ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' peptide aminoacid sequence ', ' peptide sequence ', ' protein aminoacid sequence ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Protein Family ', ' Defect ', ' Ectopic Expression ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Type IV Secretion System Pathway ', ' T4SS ', ' Type IV Secretion System ', ' type 4 secretion system ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Vector-transmitted infectious disease ', ' Vector-borne disease ', ' Vector-borne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted disease ', ' vector-borne illness ', ' vectorborne disease ', ' vectorborne illness ', ' vectorborne infectious disease ', ' paralogous gene ', ' paralog ', ' vector ', ' feeding ', ' pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' fitness test ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' vector tick ', ' tick-borne ', ' tickborne ', ' vector-borne pathogen ', ' vectorborne pathogen ', ' ']",NIAID,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,229500
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",10166783,U54CA209988,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' light microscopy ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Heterograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' everolimus ', ' SDZ RAD ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' Genomics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' microarray analyses ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' breast tumor cell ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' therapy resistant ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' epigenomics ', ' image visualization ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' analytical tool ', ' combinatorial ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' network models ', ' tumor ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' MDA-MB-468 ', ' bioprinting ', ' bio-printing ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computational suite ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Visualization ', ' feature extraction ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2021,1916303
"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality.

"Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer. Project Narrative We develop technology that will enable researchers to tap into the enormous amount of imaging data in multiple institutions to create deep learning models for cancer applications without requiring sharing of patient data. Our work will thus enable development of more robust deep learning models to improve clinical decision making in cancer than models currently built on data from single institutions. Although our focus is improving decision making in the primary brain cancer, our methods and tools are generalizable and will be broadly applicable to all cancers, with the potential for improvement in clinical care and patient health.",Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,10228687,U01CA242879,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Equipment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Glioma ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Information Networks ', ' Isocitrate Dehydrogenase ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Security ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Custom ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Fostering ', ' data quality ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Adopted ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cancer Model ', ' CancerModel ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Security ', ' Update ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' software systems ', ' patient privacy ', ' cancer type ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' data sharing ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Secure ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' inter-institutional ', ' survival prediction ', ' predict survival ', ' predictor of survival ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' clinical decision support ', ' deep learning ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Patient imaging ', ' data privacy ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,394824
"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,10246414,F32GM134595,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biology ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Fellowship ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Biological ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' professor ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' disease phenotype ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' driving force ', ' mathematical sciences ', ' math sciences ', ' mathematic sciences ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' genomic profiles ', ' genetic signature ', ' gene signatures ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,70458
"Super-Resolution Tau PET Imaging for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (the presymptomatic phase of Alzheimer’s disease) is characterized by pathophysiological changes without measurable cognitive decline and begins decades before the onset of cognitive symptoms. Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease research is in pressing need of new biomarker endpoints to enable disease monitoring before traditional cognitive endpoints are measurable. The overarching research objectives of this R03 Small Project Grant are to develop a super-resolution (SR) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging framework for tau (a pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease) and to assess the clinical utility of localized outcome measures obtained from SR PET images. Studies show that tau pathology in the medial temporal lobe is an important marker of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. Cohorts focused on preclinical Alzheimer’s now incorporate serialized 18F-flortaucipir PET scans for longitudinal tracking of tau accumulation in key anatomical regions-of-interest (ROIs). The quantitative accuracy of tau PET, however, is degraded by the limited spatial resolution capabilities of PET, which lead to inter-ROI spillover and partial volume effects. The problem is further compounded in studies spanning several decades, many of which were commenced on legacy scanners with even lower resolution capabilities than the current state of the art. Additionally, many longitudinal studies began on older scanners and later transitioned to newer models posing a multi-scanner data harmonization challenge. The proposed SR framework will perform a mapping from a low- resolution scanner’s image domain to a high-resolution scanner’s image domain and enable PET resolution recovery and data harmonization. Underlying the proposed framework is a neural network model that can be adversarially trained in self-supervised mode without requiring paired input/output image samples for training. This critical feature ensures practical clinical utility of the method as the need for paired low-resolution and high- resolution datasets from the same subject with similar tracer dose and scan settings is a major barrier for the clinical translatability of simpler supervised alternatives for SR. The proposed network, although trained using unpaired clinical data, receives guidance from an ancillary neural network separately pretrained using paired simulation datasets. For this purpose, we will synthesize paired low- and high-resolution images from a series of digital tau phantoms that will be created for this project. Training and validation of the self-supervised SR framework will be performed via secondary use of de-identified 18F-flortaucipir PET scans from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a longitudinal cohort focused on preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. We will evaluate SR performance using a variety of image quality metrics. To assess the clinical utility of localized super-resolution measures, we will perform cross-sectional statistical power analyses that estimate sample sizes per arm needed to power clinical trials. Accurate localized measures of tau generated by this project could enable early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and facilitate ongoing clinical trials by reducing sample sizes required for a given effect size. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this R03 Small Project Grant is to develop methods for generating high-resolution images of abnormal tau protein tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. This will be achieved by building a self-supervised super-resolution framework based on a deep neural network for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tau.

"BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series Project summary Large datasets generated by hospitals could have a transformative effect on medical knowledge and patient care. Yet currently the volume of data is more likely to overwhelm clinicians and the challenges of the data can overwhelm machine learning algorithms. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate data at a resolution of seconds, for the entirety of a patient's stay. Our long-term goal is to turn these data into actionable knowledge, like risk factors for a disease, early intervention targets, and real-time information to support clinical decisions. This is a broad problem, but particularly important in ICUs, which involve high stakes decisions being made in a complex environment under time pressure. We focus in particular on understanding consciousness in adults, and neurologic status in neonates. While 7% of ICU admissions are due to loss of consciousness, and degree of consciousness is critical to evaluating prognosis, making difficult choices such as when to withdraw care, and providing early interventions to improve quality of life, there are no objective or automated assessments for consciousness (adults) or neurologic status (neonates). We have shown that unresponsive patients with brain activation were twice as likely to regain the ability to follow commands compared to unresponsive patients without such activation, yet these assessments are too time consuming for regular clinical use. However we also showed that physiological data routinely collected in ICUs can be used as a proxy to classify consciousness. It is still not known why it changes and we must be sure that the patterns we find are in fact causal to avoid treating symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. There have been two key barriers preventing a causal understanding of consciousness. First, variables measured for each ICU patient differ, and can differ within a patient over the course of their admission. This leads to confounding when attempting to infer causal models, and has prevented learning a single model for all patients, which limits generalizability. Second, while the challenges of medical data require new methods, researchers are rarely able to rigorously evaluate and compare them, since real-world data lacks ground truth and often cannot be shared for privacy reasons. To address these challenges, we aim 1) to develop methods that learn generalizable causal models with latent variables (by intelligently sharing and combining information across patients), 2) to develop data driven simulations methods for testing machine learning algorithms while preserving privacy, and 3) to apply these methods to neonatal and neurological ICU data. We aim to create better indicators for consciousness and to uncover causes of both neurological status in ICU and its link to long-term functional outcomes. Our work turns potential weaknesses of medical data (different variables measured across individuals) into a strength, and will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions. Project Narrative Big data can form the basis for more precise, personalized, interventions for ICU patients, but it is challenging for clinicians to integrate a large number of complex signals. Our work will allow data to guide treatment by making machine learning more accurate and providing better ways of combining insights from many patients (each of whose data may be incomplete). These will aid in understanding consciousness in neurological and neonatal ICUs.",BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series,10123124,R01LM011826,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Ablation ', ' Performance ', ' Withdrawing Care ', ' Proxy ', ' simulation ', ' Neurologic status ', ' Neurological status ', ' Altered Level of Consciousness ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Output ', ' neonate ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' Impairment ', ' open source ', ' effective intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' neonatal patient ', ' symptom treatment ', ' symptomatic treatment ', ' treat symptom ', ' clinical decision support ', ' stroke patient ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' privacy preservation ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NLM,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,295006
"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,10087916,R01DE027677,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Acids ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Awareness ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' bone ', ' Bone Resorption ', ' Osteoclastic Bone Loss ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Apert-Crouzon syndrome ', ' Craniofacial Dysostosis ', "" Crouzon's Disease "", ' Crouzons Disease ', ' crouzon disease ', ' crouzon syndrome ', ' Craniosynostosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryonic Structures ', ' Embryologic Structure ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maintenance ', ' Laboratory mice ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Osteoblasts ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sense Organs ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Skeletal system ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Surgical sutures ', ' Sutures ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' cleft lip and palate ', ' cleft lip/palate ', ' cleft palate/lip ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Cephalic ', ' Cranial ', ' Site ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Dermal ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' cartilaginous fishes ', ' Chondrichthyes ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' craniofacial anomalies ', ' craniofacial defects ', ' craniofacial malformation ', ' Craniofacial Abnormalities ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Staging System ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Live Birth ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Appearance ', ' Skeleton ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Deterioration ', ' FGFR2c ', ' fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c ', ' coronal suture ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Chondrocranium ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' reconstruction ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' osteogenic ', ' craniofacial development ', ' microCT ', ' X-ray microtomography ', ' Xray microtomography ', ' micro CT ', ' micro computed tomography ', ' microtomography ', ' histological specimens ', ' histological samples ', ' histology samples ', ' histology specimens ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' deep learning ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,495785
"Methods for Evolutionary Genomics Analysis Summary/Abstract Continuing advances in nucleotide sequencing have resulted in the assembly of datasets containing large numbers of species, genes, and genomic segments. Phylogenomic analyses of these data are essential to progress in understanding evolutionary patterns across the tree of life, and are finding increasing numbers of applications in practical analyses that require understanding of how patterns change over time. The sheer size of phylogenomic datasets limits the practical utility of available methods due to excessive time and memory requirements. We have developed many high impact methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences, a tradition we propose to continue through this MIRA project by developing innovative methods that address new challenges in phylogenomics. We will focus on pattern-based approaches of machine learning with sparsity constraint (SL) applied to phylogenomics, as a complement to traditional model-based methods in molecular evolution and phylogenetics. In the proposed SL in Phylogenomics (SLiP) framework, we will build models that best explain the biological trait or evolutionary hypothesis of interest, with genomic loci, such as genes, proteins, and genomic segments, serving as model parameters. Preliminary results from two example applications establish the premise and promise of a general SLiP framework. In one, SLiP successfully detected loci whose inclusion in a phylogenomic dataset overtakes a consistent and contrasting signal from hundreds of other loci when inferring phylogenetic relationships. In the other example, SLiP revealed loci and biological functional categories that harbor convergent sequence evolutionary patterns associated with the emergence of the same trait in distinct evolutionary lineages. In all of these analyses, SLiP required only a small fraction of the computational time and memory demanded by traditional methods, and it enabled better evolutionary contrasts with fewer assumptions. Consequently, the successful development of SLiP will improve the feasibility, rigor, and reproducibility of large-scale data analysis. It will also democratize big data analytics via shortened analysis time and a relatively small memory footprint, and encourage the development of a new class of methods for phylogenomic analysis. This framework will be accessed from a free library of SLiP functions, which will be directly useable via command line and available in a graphical interface through integration with the MEGA software. Narrative The long-term goal of my research program is to develop methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences. In this project, we will develop a new class of phylogenomic methods based on sparse machine learning and benchmark their absolute and relative performance. New techniques and their software implementation will greatly facilitate data analyses that are vital for evolutionary and functional genomics.",Methods for Evolutionary Genomics Analysis,10086181,R35GM139540,"['Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Libraries ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Evolution ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' Categories ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' comparative ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' ']",NIGMS,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R35,2021,396250
"Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines ABSTRACT Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines have shown excellent safety and vaccine efficacy (VE) in more than 25 clinical trials in Africa, Europe, and the US; Phase 3 assessment will begin in mid-2020. Our goal during the next decade is to develop, license, and deploy next generation SPZ vaccines with increased breadth, magnitude, and/or durability of VE and decreased cost of goods. Current assays and animal models do not offer an alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating whether a vaccine candidate exhibits superior performance to current SPZ vaccines. In this project we aim to develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate a vaccine recipient will be protected against Pf malaria by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines. Success could come from increased understanding of the 1) immunological effector mechanisms of protective immunity (PI), 2) antigenic targets of PI, and/or 3) organs and cells involved in induction of the PI. Despite many studies, our understanding of these 3 areas has only modestly improved in the last 2 decades. In 2000 it was hypothesized that antigen-specific, tissue resident CD8+ T cells in the liver that recognized Pf peptides bound to class I HLA molecules on the surface of Pf-infected hepatocytes were the key cells mediating PI. This hypothesis led to a seminal study that demonstrated subcutaneous administration of PfSPZ Vaccine did not lead to induction of PfSPZ-specific, CD8+ T cells in the livers of immunized NHPs, but intravenous (IV) administration did. Based in large part on these results, a clinical trial of IV administration was initiated, and the trial showed 100% VE. Subsequently, >25 clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines have shown that empirical alteration of PfSPZ/dose, number of doses, interval between doses, and method of attenuation can improve performance of PfSPZ vaccines. However, we have learned little about mechanisms and targets of PI, or the tissues involved in induction of PI. We believe this is because the effector activity takes place in the liver, and induction of PI also takes place in the central compartment, which is inaccessible in humans. Since our last major advance came from studying the livers of immunized NHPs, we think much more information can be gleaned from this approach, including elucidation of immunological effectors and targets, and comparison and down-selection of vaccine candidates. Therefore, in this project we will develop 3 models in outbred NHPs to study SPZ vaccine-induced immunity, and use the data generated in the models and systems biology assays to establish biomarkers and groups of assays (signature) that consistently predict whether a NHP will be protected, and establish blood surrogates of tissue markers. The best assays/ biomarkers/signatures will be assessed using serum, plasma, and PBMCs from protected/unprotected subjects assessed in clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines. Finally, we will use the assays/biomarkers/signatures and model systems to screen newly developed SPZ vaccines, especially genetically altered vaccines, to down-select which should move to process development and clinical testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria affects over two billion people, killing over 400,000 individuals each year mostly children in Africa. A powerful tool is needed for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum malaria from defined geographical areas. The ideal tool would be a highly effective, long-acting vaccine that prevents infection, and thereby disease and parasite transmission. There is currently no alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating that a vaccine candidate exhibits performance superior to current SPZ vaccines Therefore, in this project we will develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate if a human will be protected against Pf infection by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines.",Development

"Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data Project Summary This project develops novel statistical inference procedures for biomedical big data (BBD), including data from diverse omics platforms, various medical imaging technologies and electronic health records. Statistical inference, i.e., assess- ing uncertainty, statistical signiﬁcance and conﬁdence, is a key step in computational pipelines that aim to discover new disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments using BBD. However, the development of statistical inference procedures for BBD has lagged behind technological advances. In fact, while point estimation and variable selection procedures for BBD have matured over the past two decades, existing inference procedures are either limited to simple methods for marginal inference and/or lack the ability to integrate biomedical data across multiple studies and plat- forms. This paucity is, in large part, due to the challenges of statistical inference in high-dimensional models, where the number of features is considerably larger than the number of subjects in the study. Motivated by our team's extensive and complementary expertise in analyzing multi-omics data from heterogenous studies, including the TOPMed project on which multiple team members currently collaborate, the current proposal aims to address these challenges. The ﬁrst aim of the project develops a novel inference procedure for conditional parameters in high-dimensional models based on dimension reduction, which facilitates seamless integration of external biological information, as well as biomedical data across multiple studies and platforms. To expand the application of this method to very high-dimensional models that arise in BBD applications, the second aim develops a data-adaptive screening procedure for selecting an optimal subset of relevant variables. The third aim develops a novel inference procedure for high-dimensional mixed linear models. This method expands the application domain of high-dimensional inference procedures to studies with longitu- dinal data and repeated measures, which arise commonly in biomedical applications. The fourth aim develops a novel data-driven procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which facilitates the integration of evidence from multiple BBD sources, while minimizing the false negative rate (FNR) for optimal discovery. Upon evaluation using ex- tensive simulation experiments and application to multi-omics data from the TOPMed project, the last aim implements the proposed methods into easy-to-use open-source software tools leveraging the R programming language and the capabilities of the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments for BBD methods and tools. Public Health Relevance Biomedical big data (BBD), including large collections of omics data, medical imaging data, and electronic health records, offer unprecedented opportunities for discovering disease mechanisms and developing effective treatments. However, despite their tremendous potential, discovery using BBD has been hindered by computational challenges, including limited advances in statistical inference procedures that allow biomedical researchers to investigate uncon- founded associations among biomarkers of interest and various biological phenotypes, while integrating data from multiple BBD sources. The current proposal bridges this gap by developing novel statistical machine learning methods and easy-to-use open-source software for statistical inference in BBD, which are designed to facilitate the integration of data from multiple studies and platforms.",Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data,10252023,R01GM133848,"['Adoption ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Linear Models ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Galaxy ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Behavioral ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' Genetic study ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ', ' TOPMed ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' R programming language ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' structured data ', ' computational pipelines ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,414994
"Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating autoimmune disease that is difficult to manage clinically, because it is characterized by unpredictable periods of remission and relapse. If the disease could be adequately monitored, it is possible drugs could intervene to prevent damage, reducing rates of relapse and overall progression. Ideally, it would be possible to repeatedly biopsy the CNS for monitoring, but this is too challenging/morbid to have utility. Herein, we propose an approach that harnesses tissue engineering principles to develop an immunological niche (IN) in vivo to enable harvest of physiologically relevant immune populations. The central hypothesis of this work is that INs can be created to reflect aspects of the innate and/or adaptive immune system that correlate with the CNS. Furthermore, we hypothesize that INs will provide a location into which a non-invasive optical sensor of multiple sclerosis can be implanted. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the FBR to implanted materials can be harnessed to create an IN reflective of innate immunity in the CNS and will dynamically monitor the formation of this niche. Scaffolds will be excised at appropriate time points during disease induction and analyzed with high-throughput gene expression arrays, scRNAseq, and machine learning to develop multivariate signatures capable of determining whether a mouse is diseased or healthy. Aim 2 (K99) will harness specific antigen-binding peptides to build noninvasive sensors for biomarkers of disease progression. Fluorophore-labeled peptides that specifically bind biomarkers of disease will be incorporated into PEG hydrogels which will be engineered such that the binding of the desired antigen will enable detection via FRET. These sensors will be incorporated into the pores of the IN to enable non-invasive monitoring of MS. Aim 3 (R00) will develop INs reflective of adaptive immune populations in the CNS, by incorporating antigens within the scaffolds. This section will create a non-invasive sensor and multivariate signature reflective of adaptive immune changes within the surrogates and harness both innate and adaptive INs to investigate mechanistic questions about innate-adaptive crosstalk in the development of MS. Taken together these studies will create engineered immunological niches and non-invasive sensors that enable the creation of enhanced diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitors, and longitudinal immunology studies without euthanasia.  This work is at the intersection of immunology and biomaterials and will require biomaterials synthesis, scRNAseq, computational analysis, tissue engineering, immunology, and biosensor design and validation. The applicant has significant experience in biomaterials, tissue engineering, and the host response, but requires further training in immunology, computational analysis, and biosensor design/validation. Both this award and the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise to begin his career as an independent investigator. Furthermore, this work will develop new diagnostics, new techniques useful to the field as a whole, and contribute to an understanding of unanswered questions in innate-adaptive crosstalk in autoimmunity. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune infiltrate into the CNS and subsequent damage to myelin, that is difficult to diagnose and monitor because the site for disease cannot be readily biopsied for analysis. The goal of this proposal is to create engineered immunological niches and corresponding non- invasive sensors that will correlate with the innate or adaptive immune responses during disease onset and progression by implanting engineered scaffolds in the subcutaneous space. The implications of this work are broad including diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitoring tools, and research tools to enable longitudinal isolation of disease-inducing cells or non-invasive protein measurements from a single host without euthanasia.",Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring,10250537,K99EB028840,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Animals ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Award ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis ', ' EAE ', ' Experimental Allergic Encephalitis ', ' Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis ', ' Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis ', ' autoimmune encephalomyelitis ', ' Engineering ', ' Euthanasia ', ' Mercy Killing ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Foreign Bodies ', ' Future ', ' Gel ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Nonspecific Immunity ', ' Morbidity -

"Advanced algorithms to infer and analyze 3D genome structures Project Summary For the past decade, the population-cell Hi-C technique has significantly improved our ability to discover genome-wide DNA proximities. However, because population Hi-C is based on a pool of cells, it will not help us reveal each single cell's 3D genome structure or understand cell-to-cell variability in terms of 3D genome structure and gene regulation. It is also difficult to achieve a high resolution, such as 1 Kbp, with population Hi- C; therefore, when finding and analyzing the spatial interactions for the promoter or enhancer regions typically associated with biologically-important regulatory elements, population Hi-C data's resolution is too low to be useful. Moreover, while we know that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a key role in the formation of genome 3D structures, the question is whether long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the process since lncRNAs have been found to recruit proteins needed for chromatin remodeling, and our preliminary research has found that lncRNA LINC00346 directly interacts with CTCF. Finally, while members of the bioinformatics community, including the PI, have developed many algorithms to reconstruct 3D genome structures based on population Hi-C data, important questions still must be answered regarding how 3D genome structures are involved in gene regulation and whether there are relationships between 3D genome structures and genetic and epigenetic features. The PI proposes to conduct leading research to overcome these challenges and address these questions. During the next five years, the PI will develop algorithms to reconstruct the 3D whole- genome structures for single cells and analyze cell-to-cell variabilities in terms of 3D genome structure and gene regulation. The PI will develop a deep learning algorithm to enhance the resolution of population Hi-C data to that of Capture Hi-C data (1 Kbp) so that we can make good use of the large amount of Hi-C data accumulated in the past decade. An online database will be built to allow the community to access both population and single-cell 3D genome structures in an integrated way. The PI will work with a cancer biologist to discover any lncRNAs that function as a scaffold to fine-tune the CTCF-cohesin protein complex, as well as two neuron scientists to develop a more complete understanding of gene regulation while considering 3D genome and other genetic and epigenetic features. Given the PI's track record and productivity, having three computational goals and two collaborative goals is not only feasible but computationally and biologically rewarding. In five years, once the proposed studies are accomplished, the PI should have established a uniquely independent place in the field of 3D genome, maintaining leading positions in inferring single-cell 3D genome structures, enhancing Hi-C data resolution, and building 3D genome databases, while establishing similar positions in reconstructing high-resolution 3D genome structures, finding lncRNAs' roles in the formation of genome structures, and understanding how 3D genome structures are involved in gene regulation. Project Narrative The three-dimensional (3D) structure of genome is critically important for gene regulation; and the abnormal 3D genome structures are often associated with diseases such as cancer. This proposal aims to reconstruct and analyze the 3D genome structures of thousands of individual cells, study how 3D genome structures participate in gene regulation, determine whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the formation of genome structures, and build an online knowledge base integrating 3D genome structures with other biological information.",Advanced algorithms to infer and analyze 3D genome structures,10237362,R35GM137974,"['Algorithms ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Play ', ' Productivity ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Work ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' genome database ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' cohesin ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' chromatin remodeling ', ' protein complex ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Process ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' Population ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Hi-C ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R35,2021,366706
"Dementia and Value of Home Time There is a paucity of quality of life (QoL) measures for persons living with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) (hereafter called PWD). Without them, we cannot assess the effectiveness of interventions, policies, or health system investments that aim to improve QoL for PWD. Such measures must acknowledge a person’s preferences and well-being, as well as dynamic changes such as where they live and receive care day-to-day. Staying in one’s home remains the dominant preference among PWD. Therefore, if more home time reflects higher quality of life, ‘home time’ outcome measures are firmly person-centered and could assess population health using ubiquitous claims data. No consensus exists, however, on what health care settings to include in a home time measure. A key reason for our incomplete understanding is that we lack the perspectives of key stakeholders–PWD and their family and friends who help them (caregivers). Nor do we know which definitions of home time most closely relate to person-centered outcomes (PCOs) that matter to PWD. The overarching goal is to arrive at a home time measure that most closely reflects quality of life for PWD and to identify intervenable risk factors that could increase QoL by increasing home time. Importantly, distinct preferences will likely merit a caregiver-version that most closely reflects their QoL. In Aim 1, we will engage a stakeholder panel and then hold in-depth interviews to identify how quality of life for PWD and for their caregivers varies depending on the PWD’s time spent in different health care settings (e.g. emergency department, outpatient surgery, inpatient, nursing home, and assisted living). In Aim 2, we will use mixed methods to develop a single home time measure for PWD that is most closely reflective of PCOs known to matter to PWD (and a separate measure for caregivers). We will link survey data with Medicare and Medicaid claims to allow a more thorough examination of candidate settings than has ever occurred. We will integrate Aim 1 data and validation results from quantitative analyses in order to finalize a home time measure for PWD and one for caregivers. In Aim 3, we will explore how intervenable risk factors that contribute to low QoL for PWD and their caregivers relate to the newly developed home time measures. Because we do not yet understand the relative importance of home, clinical, and social risk factors or how they operate together to jointly influence home time, we will use machine learning to identify impactful risk factors. Advancing the science of home time measurement is urgent, not only for Persons living with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) and caregivers, but also for health systems, given that CMS has launched demonstration programs proposing use of a home time measure as a performance metric for payment policy design. A Policy Convening meeting will help us disseminate best practices for use of the home time measure(s) and minimize negative unintended consequences of any nationally disseminated performance measure. In addition, identifying intervenable risk factors that could be addressed to increase home time for PWD will inform future interventions and practice changes. It is critically important to develop quality of life measures for persons living with dementia (PWD) that are per- son-centered, so that we can understand the extent to which interventions, policies, and health system invest- ments improve the lives of PWD. Staying in one’s home remains the dominant preference among PWD; there- fore, ‘home time’ as a quality of life measure could be a promising means of assessing population health using ubiquitous claims data. The overarching goal of the proposed R01 study is to arrive at a ‘home time’ measure that most closely reflects quality of life for PWD and to identify intervenable risk factors that could increase the quality of life for PWD and their families by increasing home time.",Dementia and Value of Home Time,10208263,RF1AG072364,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Ambulatory Surgical Procedures ', ' Ambulatory Surgery ', ' Outpatient Surgery ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Day Care ', ' Partial Hospitalization ', ' Treatment Day Care ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' home health care ', ' home healthcare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' institutional infection ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' payment ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' assisted living ', ' assistive living ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Validation ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' nursing home length of stay ', ' nursing home days ', ' nursing home stay ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' person centered ', ' population health ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' informal caregiver ', ' Informal care giver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' random forest ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,RF1,2021,2246697
"Ex vivo single molecule tools to analyze membrane receptor dynamics Membrane receptors play a crucial role in many physiological processes throughout the body by mediating communication between cells. Single molecule imaging has been used extensively to study membrane receptor assembly and stoichiometry in vitro using isolated protein and to a lesser extent cell culture. While studies in isolated cellular systems provide insight into many processes, they lack the context of the complex environment present in an animal where communication between cell types residing in tissue is critical for receptor activity. Single- molecule imaging of native proteins synthesized in vivo would provide a direct approach to measure processes, such as receptor dimerization, that regulate physiological activity. However, current methods are not capable of applying single molecule techniques to study the regulation of protein dynamics taking place within the complex environment of an animal. We have made recent advances in the development of ex vivo single molecule techniques to monitor changes in protein assembly that occur within specific organs. The goal of this proposal is to develop and validate ex vivo single molecule tools that provide new capabilities to monitor the properties of oligomeric membrane receptor assembly, resolve cell type and subcellular region specific single membrane receptors, and automate single molecule data analysis using a machine learning platform. This novel ex vivo technology will enable researchers to take a snap shot in time of the membrane receptor dynamics that took place in the mouse and monitor changes in membrane receptor assembly in response to changes in the animal's physiological environment such as disease and exposure to therapeutics. Membrane receptors are important therapeutic targets for many diseases and are expressed throughout the body. Understanding the role of receptor assembly in the complex environment of a live animal is an important step in understanding their mechanism of activation and regulation. We will develop ex vivo single-molecule methods that for the first time will enable quantitative studies of stoichiometry for receptors extracted from mice.",Ex vivo single molecule tools to analyze membrane receptor dynamics,10207891,R01GM138837,"['Animal Communication ', ' animal communication behavior ', ' Animals ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel ', ' Ca Release Channel-Ryanodine Receptor ', ' Calcium-Ryanodine Receptor Complex ', ' Ryanodine Receptor ', ' Mediating ', ' Process Measure ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' alpha-SNAP ', ' α-SNAP ', ' αSNAP ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' animal tissue ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protein Dimerization ', ' Dimerization ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' RyR2 ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' stoichiometry ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' trafficking ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' single molecule ', ' technique development ', ' tissue preparation ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' in vivo ', ' Knock-in Mouse ', ' KI mice ', ' knockin mice ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cluster computing ', ' data grid ', ' datagrid ', ' distributed computing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' presynaptic ', ' open source ', ' therapeutic target ', ' prototype ', ' nanovesicle ', ' nano vesicle ', ' postsynaptic neurons ', ' post-synaptic nerves ', ' post-synaptic neurons ', ' postsynaptic nerves ', ' Knock-in ', ' knockin ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2021,299122
"Molecular and metabolic signaling in necrotizing enterocolitis The goal of the current R35 proposal is to understand the underlying pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and to develop novel treatments for this devastating disease. The typical patient with NEC is a premature infant who rapidly progresses from mild feeding intolerance to systemic sepsis and then death within 24 hours. NEC disproportionately affects communities of color, and half of all patients will require laparotomy, which reveals patchy intestinal inflammation and necrosis. There is no specific treatment for NEC, which increases the urgency to develop novel therapies for this devastating disease.  The journey which has led me to write this proposal includes over two decades of research into NEC, including the advancement of a unifying theorem to explain NEC development, the discovery of several classes of anti-NEC agents which have been patented, and most recently, the completion as sole Editor-in- Chief of the first textbook devoted to NEC. This track record gives me a unique vantage point in which to identify the most important unanswered questions in the field, and the experience to create a plan to answer them. Prevailing thinking suggests that NEC arises from an exuberant inflammatory response to bacterial colonization in the premature intestine. In mice and human studies, I discovered that the receptor for gram negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium, is required for NEC development. TLR4 activity is higher in the premature human and mouse intestinal lining compared to the full-term intestine, which reflects TLR4's role in governing gut development. The subsequent activation of TLR4 by colonizing bacteria leads to inflammation and NEC. These observations formed the basis for my discovery of a novel class of anti-TLR4 molecules that prevent and treat NEC in mice, piglet and human tissue ex vivo. In the current proposal, we will now address four critical knowledge gaps in the field of NEC research: 1. What causes NEC and its hallmark patchy intestinal necrosis? To answer this, we will employ ssRNA-seq in mouse and human NEC tissue and human organoids to discover and then modify TLR4- dependent genetic pathways causing NEC; 2. How can we prevent NEC? We will assess the role of diet (breast milk vs. formula) and immunometabolism on the induction of inflammation in the preterm gut and then manipulate diet-induced inflammatory pathways to reduce NEC; 3. Can we predict NEC earlier? We will assess cellular and molecular maternal factors that contribute to NEC, image blood flow in the premature gut non-invasively, and develop machine learning algorithms for prediction; 4. What causes the long term complications of NEC on the lung, brain and gut? We will perform discovery arrays in humanized organoid platforms as well as mouse and piglet NEC models to identify the link between the inflamed gut and end organ injury. These studies promise to significantly advance the field of NEC, and to offer specific therapies for it. Project Narrative Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and for which there exists no effective cure. The current proposal has identified four major questions in the field of NEC which we now seek to answer, through a novel focus on identifying what causes NEC, how we can prevent NEC, how we can predict NEC, and how we can reduce the impact of NEC on causing long term complications on the brain, the gut and the lung.",Molecular and metabolic signaling in necrotizing enterocolitis,10206378,R35GM141956,"['Affect ', ' Bacteria ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Laparotomy ', ' Lipopolysaccharides ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Human Milk ', ' Breast Milk ', ' Breastmilk ', "" Human Mother's Milk "", ' Mammary Gland Milk ', "" Mother's Milk "", ' maternal milk ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Necrosis ', ' Necrotic ', ' Organoids ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Textbooks ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Writing ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Link ', ' intestinal epithelium ', ' Blood flow ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' human tissue ', ' Necrotizing Enterocolitis ', ' experience ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Modeling ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Homolog of Drosophila TOLL ', ' TLR4 ', ' Toll Homologue ', ' toll-like receptor 4 ', ' TLR4 gene ', ' Address ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' feeding ', ' inflammatory disease of the intestine ', ' gut inflammation ', ' inflammatory disorder of the intestine ', ' intestinal autoinflammation ', ' intestinal inflammation ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' organ injury ', ' injury to organs ', ' ']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,409375
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding.

"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients. Commonly used dietary patterns are a priori diet score/index based on a set of dietary recommendations for a healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Healthy Eating Index) or data-driven dietary patterns (e.g., prudent diet, western diet). Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional.

"Spatiotemporal forecasting of COVID-19 by integrating machine learning and epidemiological modeling PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to have an accurate and early prediction of the spread of highly infectious SARS-CoV-2. A correct prediction of the pandemic situation and future trends enables effective resource allocation and government policies to reduce the detrimental effect of COVID-19 on public health and economics. Although various epidemiological models have facilitated the prediction of the infection spread, their ensemble-averaging approach largely disregards critical information within the heterogeneity. Conventional epidemiological modeling is focused on the global average trends, which is limited in analyzing dynamic local information and does not allow local prediction due to spatial heterogeneity of the pandemic situations. Given the rapid changes of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also challenging to take urgent responses to the new epidemiological data if we solely rely on human intelligence. Recently, machine learning (ML) is making tremendous progress and has shown that computers can outperform humans in analyzing complex high-dimensional datasets. Our lab has been addressing these challenges in cell biology by developing an ML platform for fluorescence live cell image analyses at the subcellular level. We established the method to deconvolve the subcellular heterogeneity of time series of cell protrusion, which identified distinct subcellular protrusion phenotypes with differential drug susceptibility. Thus, our goal is to leverage our ML platform to address these technical challenges in epidemiological modeling for rapid forecasting of COVID-19 spread at the county level in the United States. First, we will advance our ML platform for the deconvolution of spatial heterogeneity of COVID-19 dynamics. This method will integrate epidemiological models and ML to identify the clusters of US counties sharing similar temporal patterns. Second, we will apply our deep learning-based feature learning, where the deep neural networks learn the critical features guided by prior knowledge and well-established epidemiological mathematical models. This will allow us to generate fine-grained forecasting maps of Covid-19 spread. Our ML platform will bring unprecedented prediction power to epidemiology and enable us to take urgent responses to the current COVID-19 pandemic and future other infectious disease outbreaks. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to apply our machine learning framework for automated analyses of county-level dynamics of COVID-19 spread in the United States. By integrating machine learning and epidemiological models, we will identify infectious hot spots and forecast COVID-19 dynamics. This system will automatically update and learn new COVID-19 data and enable urgent predictions.",Spatiotemporal forecasting of COVID-19 by integrating machine learning and epidemiological

"A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images Abstract  The ability of accurate localize and characterize cells in light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) image is indispensable for shedding new light on the understanding of three dimensional structures of the whole brain. In our previous work, we have successfully developed a 2D nuclear segmentation method for the nuclear cleared microscopy images using deep learning techniques. Although the convolutional neural networks show promise in segmenting cells in LSFM images, our previous work is confined in 2D segmentation scenario and suffers from the limited number of annotated data. In this project, we aim to develop a high throughput 3D cell segmentation engine, with the focus on improving the segmentation accuracy and generality. First, we will develop a cloud based semi-automatic annotation platform using the strength of virtual reality (VR) and crowd sourcing. The user-friendly annotation environment and stereoscopic view in VR can significantly improve the efficiency of manual annotation. We design a semi-automatic annotation workflow to largely reduce human intervention, and thus improve both the accuracy and the replicability of annotation across different users. Enlightened by the spirit of citizen science, we will extend the annotation software into a crowd sourcing platform which allows us to obtain a massive number of manual annotations in short time. Second, we will develop a fully 3D cell segmentation engine using 3D convolutional neural networks trained with the 3D annotated samples. Since it is often difficult to acquire isotropic LSFM images, we will further develop a super resolution method to impute a high resolution image to facilitate the 3D cell segmentation. Third, we will develop a transfer learning framework to make our 3D cell segmentation engine general enough to the application of novel LSFM data which might have significant gap of image appearance due to different imaging setup or clearing/staining protocol. This general framework will allow us to rapidly develop a specific cell segmentation solution for new LSFM data with very few or even no manual annotations, by transferring the existing 3D segmentation engine that has been trained with a sufficient number of annotated samples. Fourth, we will apply our computational tools to several pilot neuroscience studies: (1) Investigating how topoisomerase I (one of the autism linked transcriptional regulators) regulates brain structure, and (2) Investigating genetic influence on cell types in the developing human brain by quantifying the number of progenitor cells in fetal cortical tissue. Successful carrying out our project will have wide-reaching impact in neuroscience community in visualizing and analyzing complete cellular resolution maps of individual cell types within healthy and disease brain. The improved cell segmentation engine in 3D allows scientists from all over the world to share and process each other’s data accurately and efficiently, thus increasing reproducibility and power. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a next generation cell segmentation engine for the whole brain tissue cleared images. Our proposed work is built upon our previous 2D nuclear segmentation project using deep learning techniques. However, we found that our current computational tool is limited in 2D segmentation scenario and insufficient of annotated training samples. To address these limitations, we will first develop a cloud-based semi-automatic annotation tool with the capacity of virtual reality. Our annotation tool is designed to be cross- platform, which allows us to partner with “SciStarter” (the largest citizen science projects in the world) and acquire large amount of cell annotations from the science enthusiastic volunteers. Meanwhile, we will develop next generation 3D cell segmentation engine using an end-to-end fully connected convolution neural network. To facilitate 3D cell segmentation, we will also develop a super resolution method to impute an isotropic high- resolution image from a low-resolution microscopy image. After the development of 3D cell segmentation engine, we will continue to improve its generality by developing a transfer learning framework which enables us to rapidly deploy our 3D cell segmentation engine to the novel microscopy images without the time-consuming manual annotation step. Finally, we will apply our segmentation tool to visualize and quantify brain structure differences within genetically characterized mouse and human brain tissue at UNC neuroscience center. In the end of this project, we will release the software (both binary program and source code) and the 3D cell annotations, in order to facilitate the similar neuroscience studies in other institutes. Considering the importance of high throughput computational tools in quantifying three dimensional brain structure, this cutting- edge technique will be very useful in neuroscience research community.",A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images,10463036,R01NS110791,"['Affect ', ' Anecdotes ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Type I DNA Topoisomerases ', ' DNA Nicking-Closing Protein ', ' DNA Relaxing Enzyme ', ' DNA Relaxing Protein ', ' DNA Topoisomerase I ', ' DNA Type 1 Topoisomerase ', ' DNA Untwisting Enzyme ', ' DNA Untwisting Protein ', ' Topoisomerase I ', ' nicking closing enzyme ', ' relaxing enzyme ', ' swivelase ', ' untwisting enzyme ', ' Environment ', ' Genotype ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Light Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' brain tissue ', ' Nuclear ', ' fetal ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' virtual reality ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' tissue processing ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Slice ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Source Code ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' Consumption ', ' user-friendly ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' volunteer ', ' stereoscopic ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cloud based ', ' contrast imaging ', ' citizen science ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' annotation  system ', ' annotation framework ', ' annotation tool ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,233250
"Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a national and global public health emergency. Because the causative virus is novel, the present options for treatment are extremely limited, and an effective vaccine could be 1-2 years away. Thus, there is an urgent need for efficacious therapeutics against the disease. While development of new drugs is under way, that process is slow and resource-intensive. In the short-to-medium term, a superior strategy is to repurpose already existing drugs to treat the disease. Over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical effect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or the hyperinflammatory immune response it provokes. What is unclear is how many of these have a significant, protective effect on actual patients, as only a tiny fraction of these drugs is in clinical trials. Most of these agents are chronic medications, and thus there are millions of Americans who are already using them. The first aim of this study is to assess the degree of protection any of these drugs confers against the serious complications of COVID-19 while adjusting for known risk factors and confounders. The second aim is to search for additional interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and specific demographic and/or clinical subgroups that could be protective or harmful. The Change Healthcare Database, a part of the COVID-19 Research Database, contains up-to-date health insurance claims data for about one-third of all Americans. Using this database, this study will evaluate the impact of these drugs on the risk of four important outcomes in patients who are COVID-19-positive: need for hospitalization, use of mechanical ventilation, shock, and death. Results will be risk-adjusted for the risk factors already well established to predict poor outcomes in COVID-19. This study will further mine the data for second- and third- order interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and different subpopulations of patients using a novel machine learning method called the Feasible Solution Algorithm (FSA). The FSA enables the researcher to uncover higher-order statistical interactions in regression models, which leads to the identification of subgroups and complexities that are not always apparent with traditional regression models. If the results show candidate drugs with highly protective effects, these can be prioritized for prospective clinical studies. Drugs that show harmful effects can be considered for discontinuation in infected or high-risk patients. Project Narrative Repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is a much faster and more resource-effective approach than developing new drugs de novo. This holds promise because over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical activity against SARSCoV-2 or the immune response it provokes. Using a large health insurance claims database, we will assess the potentially protective effects of each of these drugs on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and search for interactions between multiple drugs and specific demographic and clinical subpopulations via a novel statistical algorithm.","Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach",10395043,R21LM013683,"['Algorithms ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' In Vitro ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' mechanically ventilated ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' American ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' protective effect ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' high risk ', ' drug candidate ', ' public health emergency ', ' Statistical Algorithm ', ' Statistics Algorithm ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' insurance claims ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID19 ', ' CV-19 ', ' CV19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' 2019 novel corona virus ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' COVID-19 virus ', ' COVID19 virus ', ' CoV-2 ', ' CoV2 ', ' SARS corona virus 2 ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated corona virus 2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related corona virus 2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' SARSCoV2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome CoV 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona virus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona virus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 virus ', ' hCoV19 ', ' nCoV2 ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' COVID-19 treatment ', ' COVID-19 therapy ', ' COVID19 therapy ', ' COVID19 treatment ', ' SARS-CoV-2 therapy ', ' SARS-CoV-2 treatment ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 therapy ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 treatment ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 therapy ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 treatment ', ' treat COVID-19 ', ' treat COVID19 ', ' treat SARS-CoV-2 ', ' treat coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-CoV-2 positive ', ' COVID-19 positive ', ' COVID-19 positivity ', ' COVID19 positive ', ' COVID19 positivity ', ' SARS-CoV-2 positivity ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positivity ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 positive ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 positivity ', ' COVID-19 diagnosis ', ' COVID19 diagnosis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis ', ' diagnosed with COVID-19 ', ' diagnosed with COVID19 ', ' diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 ', ' diagnosed with coronavirus 2019 ', ' diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 diagnosis ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R21,2021,245839
"Development of a novel approach to characterize human chemosensory perception PROJECT SUMMARY The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has raised public awareness of the importance of the chemical senses, and highlighted the need for better clinical tools to test them due to the significant underestimation of chemosensory loss related to COVID-19 in early 2020. The recently developed Monell Flavor Quiz (MFQ) directly addresses these key deficiencies by enabling comprehensive objective measurement of chemosensation (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) and is available for nationwide distribution. Developed as an accessible test, the MFQ can capture a more representative sample—no longer limited by geographical or logistical constraints, it enables people to monitor their taste and smell ability in the convenience of their own home. To address the complexity in chemosensory ability, the MFQ is designed to bridge the gap between changes in chemosensation and liking to better understand effects of chemosensory dysfunction on overall dietary quality. This proposal aims to (a) deploy the MFQ to characterize subtypes of chemosensory dysfunction (e.g., those suffering from co- occurring chemosensory dysfunction due to COVID-19) and (b) assess the reliability and validity of a self-administered MFQ against standardized measures of chemosensation. Aim I will address chemosensation ability in four separate cohorts, differing in their chemosensory ability (e.g., loss of smell or loss of taste), and link chemosensory perception and liking to overall diet healthiness; this information can aid in downstream development of targeted interventions for complex chemosensory disorders. Aim II will compare the reliability of the MFQ across modes of execution (self-administered vs. in-person), across time (2-week lapse), and validate it against standardized measures of smell and taste. Directly in alignment with NIDCD Priority Area # 1 in the Taste and Smell Program (understanding normal function; developing tools to measure taste and smell), the data from this project will lead to an adaptable yet comprehensive test to capture complex variations in taste and smell perception, as well as chemesthetic perception. The corresponding training plan in biomedical research supports my long-term research goal to understand the unique individual chemosensory experience and how it affects the perception of food and contributes to quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is a dearth of accessible and inclusive objective methods to measure taste and smell function, made evident by the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To address this gap, we have developed a novel, comprehensive tool, the Monell Flavor Quiz, to assess taste, smell, and chemesthetic perception and liking at scale via remote testing. The goal of this project is to characterize new informative patient groups (e.g., those experiencing co-occurring chemosensory dysfunction from COVID-19), to confirm the MFQ’s reliability against existing, less accessible measures, and to validate its use for nationwide distribution.",Development of a novel approach to characterize human chemosensory perception,10389564,F32DC020100,"['Adult ',

"A computational modeling framework for COVID-19 vaccination Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global pandemic at present. Quantitative research is urgently needed to clarify the impacts of the current vaccination campaign on the pandemic evolution and economic growth, and to guide future policy development. The overall objective of this proposal is to establish a new computational modeling framework for an investigation of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the US, and to incorporate real data to assess the impacts of COVID-19 vaccination on public health and the economy. To achieve this objective, the team will pursue three specific aims: (1) Modeling the transmission and spread of COVID-19 under the impact of vaccination; (2) Modeling the economic impact of COVID-19 vaccination; (3) Conducting a case study for the Chattanooga region in the state of Tennessee. The proposed research is significant because it will incorporate detailed characteristics and potential limitations of the current vaccination campaign (such as the vaccine efficacy, phased allocation schemes, public resistance to vaccination, and vaccine breakthrough due to new variants of SARS- CoV-2) into a sophisticated modeling framework, which will enable us to make more accurate forecasts on the progression and long-term evolution of the pandemic. As such, the project is expected to advance the current understanding of COVID-19 transmission and to quantify the interaction between epidemic spreading, economic growth, and disease prevention and intervention under the impact of COVID-19 vaccination, all of which are important for the control and management of the pandemic. The approach is innovative in the development of a computational framework that integrates novel mechanistic and machine learning models and that connects the epidemic and economic aspects of COVID-19. The innovation of this project is also reflected by the integration of sophisticated computational modeling, rigorous mathematical analysis, intensive numerical simulation, and detailed data validation. The project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration among an applied and computational mathematician with long-term interest in infectious disease modeling (Wang), an epidemiologist with extensive working experiences at CDC and a current member of the regional COVID-19 task force (Heath), a business and management professor with a background in public heath (Mullen), and a statistician with expertise in machine learning and biomedical data analytics (Ma). The success of this project will not only build a solid knowledge base for the complex transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 vaccination, but also provide important guidelines for the government agencies and public health administrations in pandemic management and policy development. Project Narrative The proposed project is relevant to public health because a deep understanding of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign and its health and economic impacts will help to inform the pandemic management and improve the current practice in disease prevention and intervention. The mathematical and machine learning models developed in this project will improve such understanding and make new knowledge discovery. This research effort aligns with part of NIH's mission to reduce public health burdens of infectious diseases.",A computational modeling framework for COVID-19

"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder: NIDA Summer Research Internship Program PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder: NIDA Summer Research Internship Program,10402983,R01DA048533,"['Adoption ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Communities ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Insurance ', ' Internships ', ' intern ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' Methods ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' combat ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' methamphetamine use ', ' METH use ', ' METH using ', ' methamphetamine using ', ' summer research ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' improved outcome ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,10647
"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of differenttypes of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by spatial context. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an extensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spatial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high-resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets",10397321,OT2OD026671,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atlases ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' cell type ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' vector ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' interoperability ', ' human imaging ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Human BioMolecular Atlas Program ', ' HuBMAP ', ' Visualization ', ' data exploration ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' ']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2021,1500000
"Informing the Emergency Care of Septic Shock Patients: A Novel Application of Data-Driven Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Septic shock is a commonly, costly, and deadly condition. There is increasing recognition that septic shock patients vary significantly in terms of (1) clinical presentation, (2) response to treatments, and (3) clinical outcomes. This patient-level heterogeneity may explain why optimal early septic shock management remains poorly understood. Patients with septic shock are four times more likely to die than septic patients without shock. Our preliminary data shows that Black patients have higher odds of mortality from septic shock compared to White patients. Current studies do not characterize patient heterogeneity among septic shock patients and do not explicate pharmacogenetic factors that may influence disparities in outcomes. Objective: Insights from synergistic data types are necessary to provide a more complete understanding of septic shock heterogeneity and hereditable factors that may influence vasopressor response and disparities in outcomes. The overall objective of the proposed research is to characterize both phenotypic and genetic aspects of heterogeneity in septic shock. This work is organized into two aims: (1) Identify Septic Shock Phenotypes Using Advanced Analytic Methods and (2) Quantify Vasopressor Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms by Race and Vasopressor Response. Our overall hypothesis is that advanced analytic methods applied to clinical and genetic data can identify defining features of septic shock heterogeneity that are relevant to early septic shock management in the Emergency Department and disparities in outcomes. Methods: (Aim 1) We will use a national dataset of septic patients with hypotension refractory to initial Emergency Department fluid resuscitation and apply unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to define clinically relevant phenotypes of early septic shock patients. We will analyze phenotypic variation in clinical characteristics and outcomes. Then, we will develop a supervised model for phenotype classification. (Aim 2) We will perform targeted pharmacogenomics of 100 samples balanced for race, 73 of which are part of an existing research biobank of septic shock patients from our urban, safety-net hospital. We will enroll an additional 27 patients to complete the sample. We will examine the presence of risk alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms for vasopressor-relevant genes by race. We will also examine the association between the targeted genetic polymorphisms and shock reversal. Career Development: During the proposed Career Development Award, I will work with my mentorship team to build the skills necessary to achieve independence as a clinical researcher. Specifically, I will 1) receive hands-on experience in the design and conduct of translational clinical research studies, 2) take didactic coursework in data science, biomedical informatics, and implementation science, 3) receive training and education in translational data science, clinical decision support, pharmacogenomics, and precision public health, and 4) become a leader and an effective mentor in academic emergency medicine. Project Narrative Septic shock is the most severe manifestation of sepsis and has a mortality rate above 40%. Unfortunately, existing sepsis research is limited by poorly understood variation and heterogeneity within septic shock patient populations. This study innovatively combines electronic health record and genetic data to improve the care of critically ill Emergency Department patients with septic shock, and addresses disparities in racial

"Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT About 1500 of the ~20,000 protein-coding genes of the human genome can bind drug-like molecules, and yet only about 600 are currently targeted by FDA-approved drugs. Therefore, at least 930 proteins are potential drug targets that are not yet being utilized for human medicine and, given our incomplete state of knowledge about the human genome, the actual number could be much higher. There is therefore a substantial unmet need to improve our understanding of this so-called genomic dark matter in order to develop novel classes of drugs to improve treatment of disease. Comprehensive experimental investigation of these proteins in the context of hundreds of thousands of compounds and thousands of diseases would be prohibitively expensive, but computational approaches could significantly refine the list. In this project we will apply two sophisticated computational approaches to the task of predicting the most promising novel drug targets. We will integrate the knowledge bases DrugCentral and other resources with the disease and phenotype knowledge base of the Monarch Initiative into a semantically harmonized knowledge graph (KG). This will result in a KG with comprehensive coverage of diseases, genes, gene functions, phenotypic abnormalities, drugs, drug mechanisms, and drug targets. Machine learning (ML) identifies patterns from training sets and applies the patterns to predict entities and relations in new data. ML using KGs has become a hot new research area in computer science, but remains difficult to use for real-world applications, owing to the lack of adequate software packages. We will therefore implement state-of-the art learning algorithms based on deep learning on KGs by extending and adapting selected algorithms to the task of drug and drug target discovery. We will develop an easy-to-use software library and demonstrate its use by means of notebooks that will be designed to serve as starting points for future computational research by other scientists, since they will contain the analysis workflow along with documentation about each step. The human genome codes more than 500 protein kinases, which are enzymes that add a phosphate group to specific amino acid residues and thereby transmit a biological signal. There are currently 35 FDA approved protein kinase modulators acting on 38 protein kinases, which are thus one of the most important groups of druggable proteins encoded by our genome. We will perform a detailed computational study of this group and experimentally validate our top, novel candidate using a patient-derived xenograft model system. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The human genome codes for over 20,000 proteins, roughly 3,000 of which are thought to be “druggable”, meaning that in principle they could be targeted by medications to treat disease. However, only about 600 of these proteins are currently targeted by an approved medication, and our knowledge about most of the remaining proteins is limited. Our goal is to develop bioinformatic software that will combine information about these proteins, diseases, clinical manifestations, medications, and other relevant data into a network of information (i.e., a graph), and to use sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict novel drugs and drug targets. We will focus our computational strategy on the class of protein kinase inhibitors, which are a leading target for cancer drugs. The human genome encodes an estimated 555 kinases, 37 of which have been successfully targeted by anti-cancer medications. By using machine learning to predict which of the remaining 500+ protein kinases are most likely to be amenable to medical treatment, there is a potential to accelerate the pace of research into novel treatments. We will perform a pilot study of the top predicted candidates using a mouse model of cancer.",Illuminating the Druggable Genome by Knowledge Graphs,10348825,U01CA239108,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Future ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Networks ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicine ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' inorganic phosphate ', ' Phosphates ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' Kinase Family Gene ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' protein kinase modulator ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' protein kinase inhibitor ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' computer science ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' validation studies ', ' Categories ', ' Knowledge Management ', ' Information Resources Management ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Genomics ', ' Documentation ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug mechanism ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Adenock ', ' Allo-Puren ', ' Allozym ', ' Allural ', ' Aloprim ', ' Alositol ', ' Anoprolin ', ' Anzief ', ' Apulonga ', ' Apurin ', ' Apurol ', ' Bleminol ', ' Bloxanth ', ' Caplenal ', ' Cellidrin ', ' Cosuric ', ' Dabroson ', ' Embarin ', ' Epidropal ', ' Foligan ', ' Geapur ', ' Gichtex ', ' Hamarin ', ' Hexanurat ', ' Ketanrift ', ' Ketobun-A ', ' Ledopur ', ' Lopurin ', ' Lysuron ', ' Miniplanor ', ' Monarch ', ' Nektrohan ', ' Pan Quimica ', ' Remid ', ' Riball ', ' Suspendol ', ' Takanarumin ', ' Urbol ', ' Uricemil ', ' Uripurinol ', ' Urosin ', ' Urtias ', ' Xanturat ', ' Zyloprim ', ' Zyloric ', ' Aloral ', ' chemical informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Cancer Model ', ' CancerModel ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' disease phenotype ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' real world application ', ' high risk ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' FDA approved ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' dark matter ', ' novel drug class ', ' new drug class ', ' knowledge integration ', ' anti-cancer ', ' anticancer ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' genome resource ', ' patient derived xenograft model ', ' PDX model ', ' Patient derived xenograft ', ' drug repurposing ', ' repurposing agent ', ' repurposing medication ', ' ']",NCI,JACKSON LABORATORY,U01,2021,536615
"Determinants of inception of inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases Project Summary Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 2 million individuals in the United States and are associated with considerable morbidity. Existing treatments achieve remission in fewer than 50% of patients. Further, despite achieving endoscopic remission, up to 30% of patients with CD or UC will relapse over the subsequent three years. Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to relapse have not been well established. The central premise of our proposal is that despite endoscopic, there exists a local pro-inflammatory microbial milieu and transcriptional profile that favors disease relapse. We hypothesize that current clinical tools do not have sufficient resolution to capture this state. Existing cohorts, by recruiting patients in a heterogeneous state of active inflammation, cannot be used to infer mechanisms of loss of remission and inception of inflammation. A targeted effort that comprehensively and longitudinally profiles a homogeneous cohort of patients in deep remission is essential to define the dynamic relationship between microbial alterations, metabolomic, transcriptional, and proteomic perturbations, and onset of inflammation. Identifying deficient components favoring relapse also allows the development of intervention to replace these deficiencies, thereby extending remission. They will also provide clues and serve as starting points for development of novel therapies. In the first aim, we will recruit 300 patients with IBD in clinical and endoscopic remission and prospectively, systematically follow them for 3 years. We will comprehensively characterize such patients through serial sampling of mucosal and fecal microbiome, serum and fecal metabolome, and proteome in addition to detailed environmental exposure assessment and measurement of drug pharmacokinetics. We will determine the dynamic predictive utility of each of these parameters in defining future relapse from a state of quiescence. In the second aim, we will define the role of pro-inflammatory changes at the cellular level by performing single cell transcriptomic analysis from colonic and ileal biopsies in patients with quiescent CD and UC recruited as above. This will provide important insights into loss of control of inflammation at the tissue level that determines future clinical activity. The final study aim will train and validate a machine-learning predictive model to define the contribution of each additional biologic layer to inception of inflammation and to identify more robust biomarkers of a state of sustained remission. Defining the molecular basis of future relapse in patients in deep remission will provide insights into the ‘pre-disease’ state, allowing for identification of immune pathways of relevance in preventing disease. Defining the fundamental mechanisms through which disease inception occurs from quiescence is critically important to inform key steps in the pathogenesis of these complex diseases, which in turn, will offer opportunities for targeted mechanism-driven interventions to aid durable maintenance of remission and health. The approaches and analyses outlined also have broad applicability to other autoimmune diseases. Project Narrative Despite achieving remission, up to 30% of patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) will relapse over the subsequent 3 years. The mechanisms of sustained remission have not been defined. We propose a targeted effort that comprehensively and longitudinally profiles a homogeneous cohort of patients in deep remission to define the dynamic perturbations resulting in the inception of inflammation in quiescent disease.",Determinants of inception of inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases,10297457,R01DK127171,"['Affect ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Bacteroides ', ' Biopsy ', ' Carnitine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Colon ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's "", "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' regional enteritis ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Influentials ', ' Maintenance ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Registries ', ' Relapse ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Sphingolipids ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' Work ', ' Interleukin-10 ', ' CSIF ', ' CSIF-10 ', ' Cytokine Synthesis Inhibitory Factor ', ' IL-10 ', ' IL10 ', ' IL10A ', ' Interleukin 10 Precursor ', ' Mediating ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Recurrent disease ', ' Relapsed Disease ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Intake ', ' Resolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' microbiome ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' soluble fiber ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' defined contribution ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' therapeutic target ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' relapse prediction ', ' predict relapse ', ' relapse risk ', ' recruit ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' dysbiosis ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' dysbiotic ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' fecal microbiome ', ' stool microbiome ', ' stool-associated microbiome ', ' fecal metabolome ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,1129731
"Cannabinoid CB2 Receptor Structure and Allosteric Modulators Cannabinoid receptor subtype 2 (CB2) is a class-A family G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), located primarily in immune-associated tissues but also in specific regions of the brain, and implicated in several inflammatory diseases and addiction. Drugs targeting CB2 are attractive treatment alternatives for chronic neurological pain and neuroinflammatory autoimmune diseases since they avoid deleterious psychotropic effects that are associated with CB1. While drug development efforts have been primarily focused on small molecules targeting the orthosteric site, limitations of poor selectivity, lack of efficacy, and development of resistance have hampered such effort. At present, there is great interests in identifying GPCR allosteric modulators that either enhance (positive allosteric modulators, or PAMs) or inhibit (negative allosteric modulators, or NAMs) agonist-induced receptor activity. PAMs/NAMs often exhibit improved subtype selectivity and spatiotemporal sensitivity, as well as potential biased signaling properties compared to orthosteric ligands. We have recently reported a 3.2 Å cryo-EM structure of the agonist-bound human CB2-Gi complex. Based on such progress, the overall goals of this proposal are to obtain a structural understanding of CB2 allosteric modulation and use our integrated computational and experimental medicinal chemistry/biology approaches to design and synthesize novel allosteric modulators for the development of CB2-specific small-molecules with potential to treat CB2-associated maladies. Thus, we first propose to elucidate the structural basis for the action of CB2 allosteric modulators by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography approaches. To achieve the goal, we will advance our established methods for structural studies on CB2 to obtain structure of CB2 with known PAMs or NAMs. Subsequently, we plan to perform in silico design of novel CB2 allosteric modulators by our established molecular fingerprint machine-learning (ML) computing algorithms and receptor docking approaches, on basis of our reported chemogenomics cannabinoid molecular information database (CBID) and 3D CB2-Gi cryo-EM structure; a virtual allosteric modulator library will be constructed using our fragment-based design (FBD) method and our established ML-classifiers and features-ranking will be applied for selection of virtual hits. Results will be correlated with CB2 structure-based modulator design via adapting the structural information obtained from our recent CB2-Gi cryo-EM structure and our novel molecular complex characterizing system (MCCS) algorithm. Finally, we will carry out medicinal chemistry synthesis of CB2 PAM and NAM ligands and validate them by radiometric binding and cellular functional assays. With the proof-of-evidence of our recent discovery of a putative CB2 NAM, successful completion of these Aims will provide unprecedented structural information on CB2 allosteric pockets, identify promising new CB2 allosteric modulators, and help to elucidate CB2 signaling and pharmacology. Narrative The research work if completed will determine the 3D structure of allosteric binding sites for cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), a significantly important drug target for treatment of diseases and disorders in which the role of CB2 is implicated (such as pain, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases and certain cancers), and allow for novel CB2 allosteric modulators to be produced via

"Integrating Stochasticity into Biomolecular Mechanisms: A New Direction for Biomolecular Modeling Integrating Stochasticity into Biomolecular Mechanisms: A New Direction for  Biomolecular Modeling Abstract It is increasingly apparent that kinetic selection plays an important role in biology. However, we are just beginning to have the tools necessary to quantify, characterize and understand it. For biomolecular processes involving multiple rare-event transitions, the canonical assumption is that mechanisms proceed following a consistent order of transitions (following a single-pathway). However, increasing evidence from single molecule experiments and biophysical measurements suggests that multiple pathways are not only possible, but essential. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an experimentally-directed stochastic simulation framework for mapping out mechanistic heterogeneity. As applications, I will focus, first, on secondary active transport in the ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and ATP hydrolysis driven translocation in several AAA+ ATPases, two processes involving chemical reactions and thus requiring multiscale methods that bridge the quantum to classical realms. The proposed approach to multiscale kinetic modeling is focused on multistep biomolecular transformations, which makes it unique to many other domains of established kinetic modeling. Thus, new methods will be developed and best practices from other domains will be adapted. It combines a bottom-up calculation of rate coefficients for kinetically relevant transitions from multiscale simulations, with a top-down parameter refinement based on experimental data. Innovation is proposed to refine the kinetic solution space with Bayesian parameter estimation, global sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, reaction path analysis and machine learning methods. These methods will be used to better characterize the Cl-/H+ exchange mechanism in the ClC-ec1 antiporter in collaboration with Merritt Maduke (Stanford). The kinetic landscape for the wildtype system will be studied to address the role of pathway heterogeneity, the origin of the non-integral 2.2:1 Cl-:H+ stoichiometry, and the relevance of the alternating access mechanism. Similar to secondary active transport, ATP-driven processes inherently involve multiple rate-influencing steps (ATP binding, hydrolysis, Pi release, ADP release, and all of the associated conformational changes). A multiscale reactive molecular dynamics method will be developed to describe ATP hydrolysis. Additionally, enhanced free energy sampling will be used to characterize other transitions and multiscale kinetic models will be developed to probe the role of kinetic selectivity and to test the controversial stochastic versus sequential proposed mechanisms in AAA+ ATPases in collaboration with Chris Hill (University of Utah).

"Guiding humans to create better labeled datasets for machine learning in biomedical research PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) has seen tremendous advances in the past decade, fueled by growth in computing and the availability of large labeled datasets. While the impact of these advances on clinical and biomedical research are potentially significant, these applications face unique challenges due to the difficulty in acquiring labels from biomedical experts. Furthermore, ML algorithms often fail to generalize across institutions or datasets due to measurement biases (e.g. MR scanners) or intrinsic demographic or biological differences between cohorts / datasets which limits their impact in biomedical science. This proposal will develop new methodology and open-source software that biomedical data scientists can use with their applications to 1. Improve data labeling by identifying the best samples for labeling that provide the most benefit for training ML algorithms; 2. Improve generalization of ML models across institutes; and 3. Perform this work on scalable cloud platforms. We will first explore how to improve upon methods known as active learning that interactively construct labeled datasets by having an algorithm select samples that address its weaknesses and present these samples to an expert for labeling. We will then investigate how these samples can be selected to improve the performance of ML algorithms across multiple institutions by learning robust patterns that are not specific to any one site. Finally, we will develop an extendable software framework that developers can integrate into their own applications to take advantage of these methods, and that can operate on cloud platforms to support scalable analysis of large datasets. This work will be developed through a combination of simulation studies using a unique repository of over 280,000 human markups of digital pathology images at multiple institutions, and also user studies of the developed software frameworks focused on applications in perinatal pathology and the human placenta. The software tools will impact a broad variety of biomedical applications beyond pathology where data labeling and multi-institutional studies remain challenging. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Machine learning tools can help biomedical researchers to understand their data or to make predictions. Acquiring labeled examples from biomedical experts is a significant limitation in developing machine learning tools. These tools also often fail to generalize beyond the datasets used for tool development.

"Democratizing Multi-Omics to Expedite Discovery of Hidden Metabolic Pathways PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how metabolism changes in many diseases because we lack methods for high-throughput, unbiased discovery of indirect metabolite-protein connections. Continued ex- istence of this knowledge gap represents a major issue for public health and the mission of the NIH because, until it is filled, development of treatments for many diseases will remain largely intractable. Multi-omic analysis of proteomes and metabolomes from the same system offers a promising path to discover hidden metabolic pathways, but the requirement for human expert interpretation is a critical barrier that prevents complete value extraction from multi-omic experiments. The long-term goal of the Meyer Research Group at Medical College of Wisconsin is to reveal previously hidden metabolic pathways. The overall objective here, which is the first step in realizing this vision, is to democratize multi-omic data collection and data interpretation, thereby increasing the pace of metabolic pathway discovery. The central hypothesis is that artificial intelligence models can learn to draw new metabolic connections between metabolites and proteins. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data generated by the applicant and published literature, which shows how the strategy reveals known and new connections between metabolites and proteins. The rationale for the proposed research is that unbiased, data- driven discovery of new metabolic connections with AI algorithms (such as deep neural networks) will result in new and innovative therapeutic targets that can be manipulated positively or negatively to prevent or treat dis- ease. Guided by preliminary data and literature, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two complementary focus areas: (1) multi-omic data integration, and (2) multi-omic data collection. The multi-omic data integration focus uses AI models, already established as feasible in the applicant’s lab, to predict metabolite-protein inter- actions. AI models will be optimized with existing public data, models will be validated with newly collected data, and then novel metabolic connections will be validated using classic genetic and biochemical techniques. The second focus area builds new, fast methods for multi-omic data collection to feed data into AI models, starting from a recent advancement published by the applicant (Meyer et al., ChemRxiv 2020, accepted at Nature Meth- ods). The applicant’s lab will further develop this method to quantify the full yeast proteome, and also extend the method to enable multi-omic analysis on a single platform. This approach is innovative because it departs from the status quo of slow multi-omic data interpretation requiring expert humans by building and validating a new, automated AI method for metabolite pathway discovery. The multi-omic data collection focus is innovative be- cause it departs from the status quo of slow multi-omic data collection requiring multiple platforms and hours per sample by enabling unified multi-omic analysis in minutes. This contribution will be significant because ulti- mately, the knowledge, validated methods, and resource datasets generated by this project will open new hori- zons in drug development for diseases with altered metabolism, such as cancers and diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of new metabolic connections between proteins and metabolites is ultimately expected to increase our range of treatable disease, which will lead to new therapeutics and increase healthy lifespan. The democratization of methods enabled by the proposed research will greatly increase the pace of metabolic pathway discovery.

"The design principles of the eukaryotic cell: uncovering the coordination of systems-level organelle dynamics, metabolism and growth Project Summary Perhaps the defining feature of the eukaryotic cell is its organization into biochemically distinct compartments known as organelles. While the biochemical functions of individual organelles are often well known, how cells regulate the copy numbers, sizes, and subcellular positions of its diverse organelles in a coordinated fashion and how organelles interact to produce integrated physiological outputs remain one of the grand challenges in cell biology. The goal of my research program is to discover the quantitative principles governing how cells regulate systems-level organelle dynamics to coordinate metabolism, growth, and proliferation. To achieve this goal, my research strategy will proceed along two directions. In the first direction, I will quantitatively determine how cells coordinate systems-level organelle dynamics with cellular growth demands. Specifically, I will quantify and build a mathematical model of the relationship between cellular organelle composition and cell growth. The model will be calibrated from data obtained by simultaneously visualizing all major metabolic organelles using our machine learning-based hyperspectral imaging platform, exerting chemical biological control over cell growth and proliferation rates, and genetically perturbing key organelle biogenesis, organization, and interaction factors. In the second direction, I will determine how cells coordinate systems-level organelle dynamics and gene expression to control metabolism during growth and proliferation. I will categorize single cells according to their organelle content and systematically measure the temporal correlations in their expression of genes whose products execute organelle-specific functions. I will concomitantly measure the metabolomic profile of these cells sorted by organelle content. I will then combine these measurements to develop a mathematical model that quantitatively captures the connection between gene expression and metabolism as mediated by the cell's organelle makeup. I will subsequently test predictions of this model by systematically tuning organelle interaction strengths by modulating the expression of organelle biogenesis factors and organelle contact sites. Successful investigations along these two directions will yield mechanistic insight into how to untangle the complex interdependencies between organelle dynamics, metabolism, and cell growth and proliferation. A systems- level understanding of how organelle composition and interactions coordinate metabolism to control cellular growth and development will lay a rigorous foundation into future investigations into how the cell actively shapes its organelle composition to match biochemical supply with physiological demand through, how this plasticity is leveraged in health by multicellular organisms to provide the metabolic flexibility needed to develop its myriad cell types, but also in disease by allowing for multiple routes to metabolic pathologies in cancer, diabetes, and aging. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance: In eukaryotes from single-celled fungi to mammals, metabolism takes place in the context of cells organized into spatial compartments known as organelles. In this proposal, we seek to illuminate the fundamental quantitative principles by which the cell coordinates the dynamic properties of its organelles, their regulation by gene expression, and the role coordinated organelle dynamics plays in cellular growth and metabolism. Knowledge of these principles can help uncover mechanisms underlying how cells develop normally into cell types and how in the context of disease, such as cancer and diabetes, they remodel their organelle composition to handle altered metabolic profiles and thus point toward potentially new targets for therapy.","The design principles of the eukaryotic cell: uncovering the coordination of systems-level organelle dynamics, metabolism and growth",10274898,R35GM142704,"['Aging ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Foundations ', ' fungus ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Health ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Organelles ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Pathology ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Data ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' imaging platform ', ' metabolic profile ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,393750
"Noninvasive bladder cancer diagnostics via machine learning analysis of nanoscale surface images of epithelial cells extracted from voided urine samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is common cancer with an estimated 81,190 new cases and 17,240 deaths in 2018 (with > 500,000 survivors) only in the US. The gold standard for diagnosis of bladder cancer includes an invasive optical bladder examination (cystoscopy) and tumor resection for pathology examination. Because of a high recurrence rate of this cancer (50-80%), frequent (once every 3-6-12 months) costly and invasive cystoscopy exams are required to monitor patients for recurrence and/or progression to a more advanced stage. It makes bladder cancer the most expensive cancer to monitor/follow up and treat per patient. Moreover, the invasive nature of the current standard of care, cystoscopy, causes rather low compliance of patient to follow this procedure. There is an urgent unmet need for a bladder cancer screening and monitoring test, which will be noninvasive, rapid, objective, reproducible, easy to perform and interpret, and highly accurate. Such a test will reduce the need in frequent cystoscopies and greatly expand the participation of patients in screening and early detection programs because it decreases the patient discomfort and post-procedural complications.  Here we propose to develop such a test for identification of the presence of bladder cancer and its aggressiveness (grade). It will be based on non-invasive analysis of individual cells extracted from urine (extraction technology already exists in hospitals for voided urine cytology tests, (VUC) the current standard-of- care, a non-invasive examination of cells in urine used to assist with cancer diagnosis and surveillance). A novel modality of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) will be used for nanoscale imaging of cells extracted from urine, mapping/imaging of the physical properties of the cell surface. The collected images will further be analyzed using machine-learning methods and novel advanced statistical approaches to identify a “digital signature” of cancer. The proposed technology is fundamentally different from previously studied urine biomarkers and all existing physical methods because it is based on the analysis of physical properties of the cell surface, not cell bulk or presence of biochemical markers or genetic analysis.  Our strong preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, its presumed superiority compared to the currently used non-invasive methods, and lead us to the central hypothesis that bladder cancer can be identified by analyzing a small number of cells randomly chosen from urine samples, with a low sampling error. This is a substantial departure from VUC tests, which require a visual analysis of many cells. Supported by the preliminary data, we propose (1) to optimize and expand the method, (2) to define the accuracy of cancer detection on a large cohort of patients, and (3) to assess the accuracy of identification of aggressiveness (low versus high grade) of bladder cancer.  Our long-term goal is to develop a non-invasive clinical method for accurate detecting of presence and monitoring bladder cancer as well as many other cancers, in which cells can be extracted from easily accessible bodily fluids without the need for tissue biopsy (e.g urine-bladder & upper urinary tract cancer, stool- colorectal cancer, sputum-aerodigestive cancer, cervical smears-cervical cancer etc.), using methods based on the analysis of physical characteristics of the cell surface. The proposed research, which is the first step in pursuit of this overarching goal. NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel, noninvasive, and sensitive bladder cancer screening test using cells found in voided urine samples that are imaged with ultra-high-resolution atomic force microscopy. The proposed method will improve the current standard-of-care cytological evaluation of voided urine test (VUC) to detect bladder cancer with higher accuracy, and further help to identify the grade of cancer. We anticipate this innovative technology will remarkably improve patient participation for screening and follow-up on bladder cancer, and confidently nominate patients for the more invasive and expensive detection using cystoscopies.",Noninvasive bladder cancer diagnostics via machine learning analysis of nanoscale surface images of epithelial cells extracted from voided urine samples,10276838,R01CA262147,"['Adhesions ', ' Biopsy ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Body Fluids ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Extracts ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cystoscopy ', ' Cytology ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dysuria ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hematuria ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Oncology ', ' Methods ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathology ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patient Participation ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Sputum ', ' Surface Properties ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urology ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Surface ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical Markers ', ' Survivors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Urothelium ', ' Burning Pain ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Atomic Force Microscopy ', ' Force Microscopy ', ' Scanning Force Microscopy ', ' Collaborations ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' physical property ', ' viscoelasticity ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Cell surface ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Malignant Urinary Tract Neoplasm ', ' Urinary Tract Cancer ', ' Urological Cancer ', ' Urologic Cancer ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' cell fixation ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' ultra high resolution ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' clinical implementation ', ' screening participation ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2021,674628
"Towards In Vivo Imaging of Tissue Metabolomics PROJECT ABSTRACT: The ability to measure and quantify the composition and abundance of various metabolites in biological samples, also referred to as metabolomics, provides a unique window into the complex biological processes at different scales. So far, the field of metabolomics has mainly been driven by technologies based on mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These technologies, although powerful, only measure metabolite profiles in homogenized biological extracts, e.g., biofluids or dissected tissues, thus losing the spatial information of the underlying metabolic processes. As spatial heterogeneity is a hallmark of metabolism, especially in complex biological systems such as animals and humans, obtaining spatially resolved metabolomics has been a dream of many biomedical scientists and engineers. In recent years, MS imaging (MSI) has emerged as a tool of choice for imaging metabolomics, which allows for the generation of spatially localized metabolite profiles from tissue sections. One major limitation of MSI is that it requires post-mortem or invasive tissue sampling, thus unable to probe metabolism at the most physiologically relevant states. This has limited its translation to human studies. MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is another alternative for imaging metabolomics. It combines the powers of MRI and NMR spectroscopy to produce spatially resolved tissue metabolite profiles, noninvasively. However, MRSI is highly limited in its poor spatial resolutions. Furthermore, most MRSI studies only target a single nucleus (e.g., 1H), thus limited in the number of molecular species measured. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a research program that will pave a path towards in vivo imaging of tissue metabolomics. Specifically, we aim to develop an unprecedented high-resolution multinuclear MRSI technology that can simultaneously map a large number of metabolites in vivo, synergizing advancements in ultrahigh- field MRI instrumentation, fast data acquisition, and machine learning driven computational imaging techniques. We also propose a novel multimodal MRSI and MSI imaging framework for validating our multinuclear MRSI technology and integrating two complementary biochemical imaging modalities for tissue metabolic profiling. Novel computational approaches will be developed to analyze the high- dimensional metabolomic data. Success of the proposed research will establish a new paradigm for generating and analyzing imaging metabolomics data. This paradigm will transform metabolomics into a powerful noninvasive and tissue specific technology (from an invasive and nonspatial-specific one) for studying metabolism in living animals and humans. These advances will enable new means to unravel the metabolic basis of normal physiological functions and different diseases, inspiring developments of new biomarkers, novel treatments, disease prognosis and management strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The field of metabolomics has mainly been driven by technologies that either completely lose the spatial information of the underlying metabolic processes being studied or require invasive procedures, thus unable to probe metabolism at the most physiologically relevant states. The proposed research aims to develop a research program that will pave a path towards in vivo, noninvasive imaging of tissue metabolomics through development of an unprecedented high-resolution, multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) technology and a novel multimodal biochemical imaging framework that integrates MRSI and mass spectrometry imaging for the first time.

"Artificial Intelligence Enabled Multi-Spectral Autofluorescence Imaging for Real-time Determination of Muscle in Bladder Tumor During Resection PROJECT SUMMARY For adequate diagnosis and staging, transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) specimens must extend into the bladder muscle wall. Studies indicate that for patients with high-grade bladder cancer, 5-year mortality was 8% when the muscle was present in the TURBT specimen, and 13% when absent. For this reason, if there is not sufficient muscle in the specimen after the initial resection, guidelines recommend repeat TURBT. Almost half of TURBTs do not contain muscle as confirmed post-operatively by histopathologic examination. There are currently no practical tools available to surgeons to determine during the procedure whether the resected specimen includes sufficient muscle tissue. The goal of this project is to develop an imaging device that will be used for point-of-surgery detection of muscle in TURBT specimen in real-time. We will use ultraviolet light-emitting diodes to selectively excite different native fluorescent molecules in the tissue sample. We will further increase the biochemical information content by complementing the autofluorescence data with multi-wavelength reflectance images. We hypothesize that the combined multi-spectral autofluorescence and reflectance images will provide a snapshot of the integral biomolecular information of the tissue and, when combined with deep learning, capture latent biochemical and morphological differences that are encoded in the multispectral images. Our hypothesis is based on the fact that the connective tissue lamina propria and epithelial tissue have different biochemical make-up than the muscularis propria. We will employ a deep learning framework on the acquired images to develop a training algorithm from >200 ex vivo TURBT specimens from > 50 patients. The measured tissue will be processed for histopathological investigation to create true labels for algorithm training. We will interpret the deep learning classification results by correlating the extracted class features from the trained neural network with input image parameters, and consequently attribute them with known biological differences of the tissue types. To test the algorithm, we will acquire independent image sets from 80 samples from 20 patients and assess the concordance between our results and pathologists’ reading of the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) slides. We will also use a convolutional neural network trained using a generative adversarial-network model to transform wide-field autofluorescence images acquired from unlabeled tissue sections into H&E images of the same samples. The virtual H&E images will be evaluated by pathologists to recognize major histopathological features in images generated with our virtual staining technique and compared with the histologically stained images of the same samples.

"Integrative approaches to dissection of endocrine communication Project Summary/Abstract  Mechanisms of inter-organ signaling have been established as hallmarks of nearly every pathophysiologic condition, where many exist as related and complex diseases. While significant work has been focused on understanding how individual cell types contribute and respond to specific perturbations related to common, complex disease, an equally-important but relatively less-explored question involves how relationships between organs are altered in the context of an integrated living organism. Current technical advances, such as proteomic analysis of plasma or conditioned media, have allowed for a more unbiased visualization and discovery of additional inter-tissue signaling molecules. However, one important feature which is lacking from these approaches is the ability to gain insight as to the function, mechanisms of action and target tissue(s) of relevant molecules. To begin to address these constraints, we initially developed a correlation-based bioinformatics framework which uses multi-tissue gene expression and/or proteomic data, as well as publicly available resources to statistically rank and functionally annotate endocrine proteins involved in tissue cross-talk. Using this approach, we identified many known and experimentally validated several novel inter-tissue circuits. This was this first study to directly link an endocrine-focused bioinformatics pipeline from population data directly to experimentally-validated mechanisms of inter-tissue communication. While these validations provide strong support for exploiting natural variation to discover new modes of communication, these serve as simple proof-of-principle studies and, thus has promising potential for expansion. As a result, we have developed a series of in silico tools to guide discovery of endocrine interactions. Specifically, pathway-targeted enrichments, Bayesian network interrogation and scalable machine learning. The goal of this proposal is to closely bridge these computational tools with experimental methods to systematically dissect mechanisms by which tissues communicate and how these interactions are perturbed in metabolic disease settings. Given that we survey genetic variation to guide prediction of new modes of endocrine communication, these findings are likely to be robust across diverse backgrounds. We will implement high- throughput screening of specific tissue communication circuits which operate under disease-specific conditions of metabolism (ex. Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes), define which are conserved from mice to humans and mechanistically dissect pathophysiologic impacts of endocrine communication through in vivo experimentation. The success of these aims relies heavily on bridging computational and experimental approaches, justified by the training and focus of the PI. Collectively, these objectives will begin with unbiased computational approaches, validate using high-throughput in vitro assays and evaluate therapeutic potential of new endocrine interactions using mouse models of disease. Project Narrative  Endocrine interactions have been demonstrated as causal and contributory to most common, most notably obesity, type 2 diabetes and resulting cardiovascular complications. The goal of this proposal is to closely bridge computational and experimental methods to systematically dissect mechanisms by which tissues communicate and how these interactions are perturbed in disease settings.

"Hyperplexed Quantum Dots for Multidimensional Cell Classification in Intact Tissue ABSTRACT The goal of this Bioengineering Research Grant (BRG) proposal is to develop fluorescent labels for single-cell classification through imaging of intact three-dimensional tissue. We are focusing on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), nanocrystals that exhibit bright fluorescence and unique optical and electronic properties. We designed new classes of QDs which we propose will allow quantitative, multispectral analysis of 30 or more distinct molecules so that hyperspectral light sheet microscopy can be used to proteomically profile and comprehensively map 20 or more distinct cell types throughout an intact tissue after a single staining step. This technology addresses an outstanding bottleneck in optical microscopy of three-dimensional tissue, for which only 3 distinct molecular markers can be easily distinguished, limiting the capacity to precisely classify cell types and to co-localize different cell types. This proposal comes at a time when new light sheet microscopes have recently become widely available for full-thickness imaging of optically cleared tissues at sub-cellular resolution such that rapid advances in multiplexing could yield rapid impacts. As an example, the investigators of this project developed workflows to optically clear, immunolabel, and image intact adipose tissues from lean and obese rodent models, in addition to software to comprehensively identify cells based on fluorescent immunostains, and deep learning algorithms to automate microenvironment segmentation. With these advances, we were able to discover new classes of immune microenvironments in adipose tissue that are believed to promote comorbidities of obesity, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. However key hypotheses regarding the nature of these microenvironments cannot be readily addressed until we can discretely categorize cells based on their molecular expression patterns within their contextual microenvironments. In this proposal, our technological goal is to develop fluorophores for high-content multiplexing in intact tissues. Our biological goal is to use these tools to understand immune cell microenvironments that regulate adipose tissue in the state of obesity. Our Specific Aims are to (1) engineer the photophysics of new classes of QD-based labels, (2) conjugate these labels to antibody fragments and validate their target specificity as molecular probes, (3) quantitatively evaluate cell labeling and classification accuracy in three-dimensional adipose tissue, and (4) apply probe panels to quantify adipose immune microenvironments at the cellular level in the lean and obese states. This is a collaborative proposal between engineers and scientists with expertise in quantum dots and molecular probes (Andrew Smith), advanced optical microscopy (Paul Selvin), biomedical image computing (Mark Anastasio), cellular immunology (Erik Nelson), and animal models of obesity (Kelly Swanson). NARRATIVE Classification of cells within human tissues is essential for understanding states of health and disease. In this proposal, we will develop a new class of fluorescent label that increases the number of molecular classification markers for cells by an order of magnitude.

"Causal Effect Estimation of Regulatory Molecules Project Summary/Abstract Transcription factors and microRNAs are essential regulatory molecules (RM) that control messenger RNAs (mRNA) and are known to be dysregulated in human diseases. Each RM may affect multiple pathways of the cell which is both a blessing and a curse. If a therapy targets the proper RM, it can attack the disease from multiple fronts and increase efficacy. On the other hand, targeted therapy may result in serious adverse effects due to our limited knowledge of the downstream causal effect of RM manipulation. Although the local bindings between single RMs and their targets have been studied computationally and experimentally, the intensity of functional consequences of such bindings on the transcriptome is unclear. Here, I propose statistical machine learning techniques and causal inference methods to predict the observed variability of gene expression using only regulatory molecules and estimate their downstream causal effect on the entire transcriptome. To achieve this goal, I start in Aim 1 by building a multi-response predictive model to predict the whole transcriptome using only RMs. This goal is challenging because the dimension of the response vector is more than the number of samples and I will use techniques from high-dimensional statistics to address this issue. In Aim 2, I will go beyond predictive modeling by estimating the causal effect of RMs on the transcriptome using invariant causal prediction. I will leverage the rapidly growing literature which connects causal inference to invariant prediction accuracy across heterogeneous data sources to infer the causal effect of RMs on mRNA. Having developed both predictive and causal models of RMs contribution to gene regulation, in Aim 3 during the R00 phase, I will focus on the most recent advances in double/debiased machine learning which allows the use of scalable machine learning methods for reliable estimation of causal effect of RMs on transcription. My proposed research will bring the most advanced statistical machine learning and causal inference techniques to genomics research and help design more effective targeted therapies by providing insights into the global role of RMs in gene expression regulation. During the training phase of the award, with the support of my outstanding mentoring team and scientific advisory committee, I will gain expertise in molecular biology and genomics while perfecting my knowledge of causal inference and machine learning. The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Hospital and the Mathematical Biosciences Institute will provide me with the ideal interdisciplinary environment to bridge data science and genomics and will help me achieve my career development goals and transition to a tenure-track faculty position.

"Predicting Substance Use among Military Veterans with a Positive MST Screen: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Military sexual trauma (MST) is a serious and pervasive problem among military populations, affecting approximately 16% of military personnel and veterans [1]. Substance use disproportionately affects individuals with a history of MST. Individuals with (vs. without) a history of MST are twice as likely to misuse substances [2-4]. Substance use among military samples has been linked to higher rates of negative consequences across several domains (e.g., health, occupational, legal [5, 6]), including death (e.g., overdose [7], traffic accidents [8], suicide [7, 8]). Further, while understudied among individuals with a history of MST in particular, negative substance use outcomes have been shown to be more severe among trauma-exposed populations, including more severe clinical presentations and poorer treatment prognosis [9, 10]. These findings emphasize the importance of clarifying the association between MST and substance use among military populations. Despite the clinical relevance and public health significance of substance use among military populations, research in this area has relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional designs. Moreover, the vast majority of studies in this area have utilized traditional statistical methods, which are limited in scope and capabilities. These limitations have important clinical implications, as they restrict our ability to specify the exact nature and directionality of the relationship between MST and substance use, thereby affecting how findings are translated into prevention and intervention efforts. The proposed research aims to fill these critical gaps by utilizing the Army STARRS pre/post-deployment study, a large, prospective military dataset to: (1) explicate the directional relation between MST and substance use using a longitudinal dataset, and (2) employ machine learning methods to develop an algorithm to optimize detection of substance use in military personnel with a history of MST. These findings will assist in elucidating the etiology of substance use among this high-risk group, as well as provide a prediction model for clinical use to better target at-risk individuals in this population. This research project will take place within the Department of Psychology at the University of Rhode Island; an institution with a strong history and commitment to health behavior research and methodology. The applicant will have access to sponsors and consultants with expertise in MST, substance use, advanced methodology, and statistical analysis that will facilitate her career objectives to develop increased knowledge and proficiency in (a) sexual trauma (e.g., MST) and substance use in military veterans; (b) grant/manuscript development; (c) statistical and methodological capabilities (i.e., machine learning); and (d) big data. The proposed project uses a timely and innovative approach to advance science on the relation between MST and substance use in military personnel. Addressing substance use in this population is necessary to improve the health of our nation's veterans, and aligns with the mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Project Narrative Military sexual trauma (MST) is highly prevalent among military personnel and is associated with disproportionate rates of substance use. By explicating the directional relation between MST and substance use, and utilizing machine learning to develop high-quality prediction models for clinical use, the proposed study will inform prevention and intervention efforts for this high-risk group. Findings will be used to improve clinical outcomes among military personnel with exposure to MST, and reduce the onset and maintenance of problematic substance use and associated negative consequences.",Predicting Substance Use among Military Veterans with a Positive MST Screen: A Machine Learning Approach,10458304,F31DA051167,"['Traffic accidents ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' military population ', ' Mission ', ' Overdose ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Medication ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Sexual Harassment ', ' Sexual Harrassment ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Distress ', ' sexual assault ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' sexual attack ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Occupational ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' high risk behavior ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' To specify ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' sexual trauma ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' substance misuse ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Service provision ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' military veteran ', ' veteran population ', ' military service ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,F31,2021,2500
"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical

"Quantitative protein network profiling to improve CAR design and efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY This grant is in response to PAR-18-206, Bioengineering Research Grants (BRG). Our goal is to adapt a cutting-edge proteomic network analysis platform, Quantitative Multiplex co-Immunoprecipitation or QMI, to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell signaling. We will then use CAR-QMI to characterize signal transduction network activation downstream of the CAR, to both understand how the CAR instructs a T cell to attack and destroy cancerous targets, and to make batch-specific predictions about efficacy and side-effect profiles of CAR T cell products. CAR T cells are a breakthrough anti-cancer therapy that recently won FDA approval for relapsed B cell lymphomas. A true “personalized medicine”, CAR T cells are manufactured for each patient from that patient's own T cells by transducing T cells collected by leukopheresis with a viral vector encoding a CAR. However, since each batch is unique, some batches perform better than others in terms of producing remissions and/or deleterious and sometimes fatal side effects including cytokine storms and neurotoxicity. The goal of this project is to develop a “personalized signal transduction network analysis platform” that can screen each batch of CAR T cells and predict the efficacy and side-effect potential of that specific batch. Because signal transduction networks integrate information from multiple input sources- for example costimulatory and immunosuppressive cell surface receptors, patient genetic background, and T-cell specific history of activation- we hypothesize that this readout will be a powerful predictor of function. Our preliminary data show that small changes in CAR design parameters such as scFV binding domain affinity produce measurable changes in signal transduction network state that correlate with functional variables such as target killing ability and cytokine release. Further, we show that there exists considerable individual-to- individual variation in batches of CAR T cells produced from different donors. Therefore, the two prerequisites for an individualized predictive assay are present- variation in our measurement across the population, and the functional relevance of our measurement to outcome parameters. Our interdisciplinary team consists of experts in CAR development, signal transduction, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Our ambitious but achievable goals are to expand the QMI panel to include CAR-specific components; to understand how CAR design parameters influence both signal transduction network states and functional performance measures; and to develop a predictive machine learning algorithm that translates QMI-derived signal transduction network states into a functional biomarker of in vivo clinical efficacy. Successful completion these aims will (1) identify specific proteins or protein interactions that determine clinically-relevant outcomes such as cytokine production or cell killing ability, allowing CAR designers to rationally modify the design of CARs to target specific signaling outcomes; (2) provide clinicians with a test to predict the clinical performance of CAR T cells on a batch-to- batch basis; and (3) provide the community with a novel analytical platform to measure CAR activity. PROJECT NARRARATIVE CAR T cells have the potential to recognize and specifically kill cancer cells, making them the target of extensive anti-cancer drug development research. This proposal will use a novel technology for monitoring the activation state of a T cell, a protein-interaction-network based approach called Quantitative Multiplex co-Immunoprecipitation, or QMI. Our goal is to identify a protein interaction network state indicative of clinical performance, and to better understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for CAR T cell efficacy.",Quantitative

"Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years, and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein- peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve four goals: Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of freedom in peptides. Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at much lower cost. Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost. Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide leads by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. The ability to predict protein-peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. We propose to tackle the challenge of protein- peptide structure prediction, including developing the first in silico peptide screening method to dramatically save cost and time.

"Development of a biomarker panel for screening and early detection of gynecological cancers PROJECT SUMMARY It is estimated that more than 80,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian (OvCA) and endometrial (EndoCA) cancers this year in the U.S. and this will result in the death of 26,000 women. There are no screening tests for either of these two female-specific cancers which also disproportionally affect ethnically distinct populations. For both cancers, detection of early stage, localized disease is associated with 5-year survival rates in excess of 90%, while diagnosis with late stage, metastatic disease results in dramatically reduced 5-year survival rates of ~25%. MDDx, Inc. has been leveraging access to >12 years of longitudinally collected and deeply annotated biobanked plasma samples from the Gynecologic Cancer Translational Research Program (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; New York, NY and Nuvance Health; Danbury, CT) to identify tumor-associated autoantibodies (AAb) that could serve as diagnostic biomarkers. By performing AAb profiling against the entire human proteome and applying our novel machine-learning based method for classification of molecular profiles we have determined that classification signatures of <20 biomarkers can differentiate between women: 1. with and without cancer with accuracies of ~90% or higher (area under receiver operating curve, AUROC=0.92), 2. with OvCA vs EndoCA (AUROC=0.97), and 3. type I vs II EndoCA subtypes. This current approach requires that each patient is screened using the 21,000 protein array, which while powerful, would be prohibitively expensive and inefficient, and complicates the process of assigning a risk score; however, our data indicates that there is a minimum and common set of ~100 biomarkers that could be used for screening all women. This STTR program aims to refine our current platform into an affordable, easy-to-use, high confidence biomarker panel that can be used to screen all perimenopausal and older women as well as those with known risk factors for these two cancers. The goal of this Phase I STTR proposal is to select the optimized set of AAbs required to assign a high specificity risk score and perform preliminary validation of this diagnostic panel. In Aim 1 we will expand our proprietary database of plasma autoantibodies to ensure that we have a sample size (~650) that will enable us to confidently apply our machine learning approaches to identifying the minimal panel of AAbs for the diagnostic. We will use this enhanced database to identify a prototype panel of ~200 AAbs for construction of classification scoring functions to distinguish between cancer and no cancer, as well as OvCA vs. EndoCA, and type I vs II EndoCA. In Aim 2 we will perform a blinded validation and performance study using an independent set of 200 biobanked blood samples of women with and without these cancers to identify the minimal panel of ~100 biomarkers for large scale prospective validation in Phase II. Successful completion of this Phase I program will identify the optimized panel of AAbs for an affordable, laboratory-based screening test to enable identification and provide actionable management recommendations for asymptomatic women with high specificity risk scores for OvCA and EndoCA when they are still curable. PROJECTIVE NARRATIVE There are no screening tests to detect ovarian and endometrial cancers, two cancers which will be diagnosed in nearly 80,000 women in the United States this year and will lead to the death of 26,000 women. MDDx is developing an affordable, easy-to-use, high confidence diagnostic test that can be used to screen all perimenopausal women and older, as well as those with known risk factors for these cancers. Such a test will enable early detection, dramatically reducing health care costs associated with late-stage cancer surgery and care and will save lives and improve quality of life for all women facing these devastating diseases.",Development of a biomarker panel for screening and early detection of gynecological cancers,10139681,R41CA257115,"['Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Gynecologic ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Sample Size ', ' Localized Disease ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Entropy ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Endometrial Cancer ', ' Endometrium Cancer ', ' Endometrium Carcinoma ', ' Endometrial Carcinoma ', ' Visit ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Female Reproductive Cancer ', ' Gynecologic Cancer ', ' Gynecological Cancer ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' gynecologic malignancy ', ' gynecological malignancy ', ' Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Proteome ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer surgery ', ' cancer care ', ' Perimenopausal ', ' peri-menopausal ', ' peri-menopause ', ' Perimenopause ', ' Protein Array ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' older women ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' diagnostic panel ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' cancer markers ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' reproductive tract ', ' genital tract ', ' translational research program ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' screening panel ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' autoreactive antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Baltimore ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Female ', ' Female genitalia ', ' Female Genital Organs ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Probability ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' ']",NCI,"MDDX, INC.",R41,2021,373806
"Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) Project Summary/Abstract  The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have enabled the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of disease phenotypes, at the tissue and even the single cell level. This has allowed development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients. Thus, new genomic science educational initiatives need to be continually updated to educate the clinical and translational workforce on how to effectively interpret and apply the findings from genomics studies. Patients of providers who have participated in these educational initiatives also benefit as it allows for more rapid integration of genomic study findings into the clinical care setting. Thus, in response to PAR-19-185, we propose to develop and implement the Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) program that will not only focus on the analysis of genomic data, but also on gene-expression data, the integration of these two data types, as well as introductory theory and application of statistical and machine learning methods. Specifically we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Develop and successfully implement the online and in-person phases of CREiGS to increase the methodologic ingenuity by which researchers tackle important genomics-related clinical problems. 2. Establish a Diversity Recruitment External Advisory Board to ensure that the most effective strategies are employed to recruit URM doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from academic institutions nationwide into CREiGS. 3. Enhance the dissemination phase of CREiGS by packaging and uploading the asynchronous lectures and the online critical thinking/problem solving assessments with solutions for publicly available, online teaching resources. 4. Implement effective methods to evaluate the efficacy of CREiGS by examining:1) the participants' grasp of the CREiGS core competencies, 2) the clarity and quality of the curriculum, 3) program logistics and operation, and 4) the participants' short-term and long-term success attributed to participation in CREiGS. In summary, we posit that CREiGS will provide participants with a solid foundation in genomics science to answer complex, clinical questions. We believe that CREiGS supports the mission of the NHGRI by providing researchers with rigorous training to “accelerate medical breakthroughs that improve human health.” Project Narrative The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have allowed for the development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients.

"Developing novel algorithms for spatial molecular profiling technologies Project Summary The location, timing and abundance of mRNA and proteins within a tissue underlie the basic molecular mechanisms of cell functions and physiological and pathological developments. For example, the study of expression of thousands of genes simultaneously at different locations could reveal great insights into embryo development, the cooperation of molecular and cellular processes for high-order mental functions, and the molecular basis and clinical impact of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Recent technology breakthroughs in spatial molecular profiling (SMP), including both imaging-based technologies and sequencing-based technologies, have enabled the comprehensive molecular characterization of single cells while preserving their spatial and morphological contexts. Due to the huge potential to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cellular and physiological phenotypes, SMP technologies are rapidly gaining attention and a large amount of such data will be generated. However, there are only few computational methods developed to analyze such rich but complex data, and the limitations of computational methods lead to such valuable data being largely under-used. The overarching goal of this study is to develop computational methods to analyze SMP data to characterize detailed molecular spatial distributions and associate such information with cellular phenotypes and physiological phenotypes. The specific aims are as follows: 1. develop novel spatio-statistical methods to characterize spatial distributions of gene expression; 2. develop computational methods to characterize cellular spatial organizations and investigate their relationship with molecular spatial distributions and disease status; 3. develop user-friendly software to facilitate researchers in SMP data analysis and visualization. In order to achieve this goal, we have assembled a strong team with complementary expertise in single-cell genomics, tissue image analysis, spatial modelling, machine learning and software development. If implemented successfully, this platform will greatly facilitate users in understanding molecular and cellular spatial organization in biological tissues and provide comprehensive insights into the underlying biological processes.

"A Feasibility Study of a High-Throughput Live-Cell Microscopy Design for Visualizing Viral Particle Action and Nano-Carrier Delivery Performance Project Summary/Abstract Decades of basic research have afforded a general picture for how a viral particle may approach a cell, be internalized by the cell, and hijack the cell to produce more progenitors. The accumulated knowledge, in turn, has allowed one to formulate specific mechanistic questions. For instance, why would a particular mutation in a virus make it more effective in infecting a live cell? Is it because the mutation makes the virus stay on the cell surface longer (on time) but exhibiting the same cell-internalization propensity, or is it because the mutation makes it easier for the virus to invade the cell while the off time remains the same? Where inside a cell and when does a viral particle escape an endosomal enclosure and/or shed its capsid to release its genetic material? By analogy, similar questions can be formulated in designing nanoparticle-based drug delivery vessels. Many ingenious experiments using a diverse array of biochemical and biological tools have been devised to address them, and the insights have led to translational research that has direct therapeutic impacts. A direct observation and recording of these dynamical events that a viral particle may exhibit in its cell-invasion and multiplication cycle could potentially offer much more. Recently, our laboratory put forward a proof-of-principle imaging platform that allows one to do just that: While an integrated two-photon laser-scanning microscope continuously provides 3D sections of the environmental context of a moving virus-like nanoparticle, the nanoparticle is tracked in 3D. This is performed by moving the sample in order to keep the particle at the center of a microscope objective focus with a super-resolution localization precision (~10 nm) in all three dimensions and at a 10-microsecond time resolution. Even for events as simple as a virus-like nanoparticle approaching and landing on a cell, this prototype multiresolution microscope has allowed us to uncover that, unexpectedly, a virus-like particle tends to slow down significantly before its landing on a cell surface. While the prototype instrumentation demonstrates that direct 3D high-resolution visualization could indeed provide uniquely new information that has been inaccessible using conventional methods, its trajectory throughput is too low to be of widespread practical use. This developmental project is intended to test whether a new microscopy design would make this approach higher throughput. This is to be achieved by a new instrumentation design and a machine learning computational backend for dynamic content filtering. Quantitative measures for benchmarking and feasibility testing are also described. If feasible, the community would have a completely new and practical way of looking at viral particle actions and nano-carrier delivery performances. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to evaluate a new live-cell microscopy instrumentation design, intended for practical applications in areas such as the basic research of virology and drug delivery. The design leverages the advantages of concurrent 3D imaging at three different optical resolutions where the data acquisition is assisted by machine learning. If feasible, this high throughput yet high content instrumentation design would provide a completely new way of visualizing single viral particle actions or individual nano-carrier delivery performances— in real time with 3D contextual fidelity at a particle-localization precision as high as ~10 nm in all three axes with 10-μs time resolution.",A Feasibility Study of a High-Throughput Live-Cell Microscopy Design for Visualizing Viral Particle Action and Nano-Carrier Delivery Performance,10193517,R21EB031374,"['Alpha Particles ', ' Alpha Particle Radiation ', ' Alpha Radiation ', ' α Particles ', ' Behavior ', ' Capsid ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' instrumentation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Microtubules ', ' Micro-tubule ', ' Motion ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Endosomes ', ' Receptosomes ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' virology ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Area ', ' Diffuse ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Genetic Materials ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' particle ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' Laser Scanning Microscopy ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Cell surface ', ' Sampling ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' virus-like nanoparticles ', ' viruslike particle ', ' Virus-like particle ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Invaded ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanocarrier ', ' nano carrier ', ' nanoparticle ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' Coupling ', ' data acquisition ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' progenitor ', ' prototype ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' imaging platform ', ' live cell microscopy ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' neural network ', ' Visualization ', ' data streams ', ' feasibility testing ', ' ']",NIBIB,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,363354
"Glaucoma Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning Integration of Image-Based Phenotypes and Genetic Associations PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This proposal describes a 5-year training program to develop an academic career focused on improving glaucoma risk prediction through a combination of genomic and phenotypic risk. I will use supervised, semi- supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to define novel structural and longitudinal image based endophenotypes for POAG aligned with disease subtype and progression. These endophenotypes will be used to discover new disease associated genomic loci. By including longitudinal data, we aim to identify genetic markers for progressive disease. We will use known POAG risk variants and novel genetic variants identified in these analyses to create several candidate genome wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) for POAG. Each candidate PRS with and without addition of demographic and image features will be tested for its utility to predict glaucoma risk is independent NEIGHBORHOOD and LIFE cohorts. We hypothesize that a PRS based on genetic variants associated with our endophenotypes will have improved POAG case predictive power compared to PRS based on cross-sectional genome wide association studies. The proposed studies have the potential to provide insight into disease pathogenesis and improve predictive power of genetic testing  I am well positioned to conduct this research and undertake the training proposed here. I have a strong quantitative science background with a degree in engineering, statistical training and established track records of large database research. Additionally, I have proposed a detailed career development plan that will allow me to 1) learn the fundamentals, applications and limitations of machine learning based approaches for automated fundus image analysis and 2) understand computational biology and statistical approaches to handle large genomics datasets. My training plan includes an MPH in quantitative methods at the HSPH with concentration in computational biology and statistical learning. Additionally, I am supported by a multidisciplinary team of committed mentors dedicated to my academic growth and progression into an independent clinician scientist. I will work with glaucoma genetics experts, Drs Wiggs and Segre, and leaders in statistical and machine learning, Drs Elze and Kalpathy-Cramer. I will have full access to the extensive resources at MEE, Partners Healthcare and the Harvard system for this work and my career development.  The research outlined here will improve our understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and lay the foundation for development of multimodal precision medicine approaches for glaucoma screening and diagnosis. This research is cutting edge and prepares me well for my career as an independent NIH funded investigator with the aim to use longitudinal multi-modal clinical, imaging, testing and multi-omics data in multi- ethnic glaucoma patients to 1) understand pathways of vision loss, 2) develop precision medicine approaches to pre-symptomatically identify patients at high risk of functional vision loss and progression and 3) make these technologies a clinical reality in order to reduce the burden of unnecessary blindness. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is a progressive, irreversible optic neuropathy with variable presentation and clinical course and we currently lack the ability to pre-symptomatically distinguish patients at risk of severe and progressive disease from those individuals unlikely to develop glaucoma-related vision loss. Using existing data from two large biobanks, this project will use cutting edge machine learning approaches to define POAG phenotypes aligned with disease subtype and progression, use these to discover novel disease related genetic associations, and test their utility for identifying glaucoma cases in independent cohorts. Ultimately, we aim to develop a precision medicine approach using imaging and genetic features to improve our assessment of disease risk for any individual.",Glaucoma Risk Prediction Using Machine

"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability.

"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease.

"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,10126805,U01AI150739,"['Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Crystallization ', ' Crystallography ', ' Crystallographies ', ' Engineering ', ' Genes ', ' Glycoproteins ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' flu vaccine ', ' flu virus vaccine ', ' vaccine against flu ', ' vaccine against influenza ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Linear Programming ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' flu immunisation ', ' influenza virus vaccination ', ' vaccination against influenza ', ' Vaccines ', ' Viral Vaccines ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Generations ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' treatment vaccines ', ' vaccine for the treatment ', ' vaccine for treatment ', ' therapeutic vaccine ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' neutralizing antibody ', ' Viral ', ' particle ', ' receptor bound ', ' receptor binding ', ' structural biology ', ' molecular recognition ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Memory B Cell ', ' Memory B-Lymphocyte ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' cross reactivity ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Influenza Virus ', ' influenzavirus ', ' Affinity ', ' in vivo ', ' Antibody Repertoire ', ' Vaccine Antigen ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' immunogenicity ', ' influenza virus strain ', ' flu serotype ', ' flu strain ', ' flu subtype ', ' flu viral strain ', ' flu virus strain ', ' influenza serotype ', ' influenza strain ', ' influenza subtype ', ' influenza viral strain ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' nanoparticle ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Influenza Hemagglutinin ', ' Influenza HA ', ' flu HA ', ' flu hemagglutinin ', ' influenza viral HA ', ' influenza viral hemagglutinin ', ' influenza virus HA ', ' influenza virus hemagglutinin ', ' Therapeutic antibodies ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' antibody engineering ', ' combat ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' protective efficacy ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' screening ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' lab experiment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' universal influenza vaccine ', ' universal flu vaccine ', ' universal influenza virus vaccine ', ' universal vaccine against flu ', ' universal vaccine against influenza ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2021,1224163
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,10126058,R01LM010098,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Community Medicine ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Pythons ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' PubMed ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' information resource ', ' knowledge resource ', ' knowledge resources ', ' Information Resources ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' phenotypic data ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data preservation ', ' ClinVar ', ' virtual intervention ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,369515
"Selection of Flow Modulation Protocols for Patients on Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices (CF-VADs) PROJECT SUMMARY A major concern with continuous flow ventricular assist devices (CF-VADs) is the resulting non-physiological flow with diminished pulsatility which has been shown to be a major risk factor for development of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. To address this issue, flow modulation via rapid changes in pump impeller speed has been proposed as a technique to introduce ‘artificial pulsatility’. However, given the inadequacy of large animal models with recreating CF-VAD associated non-surgical bleeding events, it is still unclear if artificial pulsatility can prevent these adverse events or what level of artificial pulsatility is even necessary. To evaluate the effects of pulsatility and identify promising flow modulation approaches we developed a vascular pulse perfusion model (VPPM) to culture Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAECs) under conditions of normal pulsatile flow or flow with diminished pulsatility (CF-VAD support). Our rationale for modeling arterial vessels is because pulsatility primarily affects the arterial side of the circulatory system and its effects are transduced by endothelial cells that line the large arterial vessels. The VPPM was validated as relevant model via direct comparison with aortic samples of patients with and without CF-VADs. Our published data also shows that loss of pulsatility is associated with an increase in production of pro-angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The relevance of these results is further strengthened by supporting data from patients that experience AVMs and GI bleeding events (both CF-VAD related and due to other conditions) showing similar elevated levels of pro- angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The VPPM therefore provides a powerful model to evaluate artificial pulsatility in the context of CF-VAD flow modulation and determine if restoring pulse pressure and/or pulse frequency can mitigate non-surgical bleeding events. Based on recent studies that suggest that pulse pressure < 35 mmHg is a major risk factor for development of GI bleeds, we hypothesize that “Diminished pulsatility associated with ‘CF-VAD support’ results in endothelial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory/pro-angiogenic soluble factor production. These changes can be mitigated via introduction of artificial pulsatility using flow modulation strategies where pulse pressure is preserved at > 35 mmHg”. Aim1 will evaluate response of patient derived endothelial cells within the VPPM to CF-VAD flow and quantify angiogenic/inflammatory soluble factor production, Aim2 will follow patients for up to 36 months to evaluate serum levels of pro-angiogenic/pro- inflammatory cytokines and non-surgical bleeding events which will then be compared to results from in-vitro studies within the VPPM and Aim3 will evaluate different flow modulation strategies using patient-derived endothelial cells to determine most promising patient-specific approaches via comparison of hemodynamic profiles and cytokine biomarkers using deep learning approaches. Successful completion of this project will enable identification of device-based strategies to prevent non-surgical bleeding in patients on CF-VAD support. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to determine the effects of diminished pulsatility during continuous flow ventricular assist device (CF-VAD) support on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Changes in production of pro- angiogenic/pro-inflammatory cytokines will be used as biomarkers to evaluate the effects of loss of pulsatility and help validate new approaches to introduce artificial pulsatility in CF-VADs.",Selection of Flow Modulation Protocols for Patients on Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices (CF-VADs),10116660,R01HL151663,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Animals ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Endothelium ', ' Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage ', ' GI bleeding ', ' GI hemorrhage ', ' gastrointestinal bleeding ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Pulsatile Flow ', ' Pulsatile Perfusion ', ' Pulsating Flow ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sheep ', ' Ovine ', ' Ovis ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transducers ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Endothelin-1 ', ' EDN1 ', ' ET-1 ', ' Endothelin Type 1 ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Pump ', ' improved ', ' Refractory ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Arteriovenous Angioma ', ' Arteriovenous Hemangioma ', ' Racemose Angioma ', ' Racemose Hemangioma ', ' Arteriovenous malformation ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' experience ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Speed ', ' Devices ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Pulse Pressure ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' F8VWF ', ' vWF ', ' VWF gene ', ' Address ', ' Artificial Heart Ventricle ', ' Artificial Ventricles ', ' Ventricle-Assist Device ', ' ventricular assist device ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' safety testing ', ' operation ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' preservation ', ' patient response ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,593704
"Developing deep learning models for precision oncology Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this study is to develop machine learning methods, especially deep learning models (DLMs), to learn a better representation of activation states of cellular signaling pathways in an individual tumor and use such information to predict its sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. Cancer is mainly caused by somatic genome alterations (SGAs) that perturb cellular signaling pathways, and aberrations in pathways eventually lead to cancer development. Precision oncology aims to accurately detect and target tumor-specific aberrations, but challenges remain. Currently, there is no well-established method to detect the activation states of signaling pathways, and the common practice of using mutation status of a targeted gene as the indicator for prescribing a molecularly targeted drug has limitations. To overcome such limitation, we hypothesize that, by closely simulating the hierarchical organization of cellular signaling systems, DLMs can be used to systematically identify major cancer signaling pathways, to detect tumor-specific aberrations in signaling pathways, and to predict cancer cell sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs.  We will develop models that more precisely represent the state of signaling systems in cancer cells and use such information to enhance precision oncology. I will design and apply innovative DLMs to cancer big data, including large-scale pharmacogenomic data and cancer omics data to learn unified representation of aberrations in signaling systems caused by driver SGAs in cancer cell, despite of their different growth conditions, such as in cell culture, PDX and real tumor. This will enable us to transfer the models trained using cell lines and PDXs to clinical setting (real tumors) in future. By the nature of drugs that may share common target proteins, we develop model DLM-MLT (the combination of DLM and multi-task learning) to predict the sensitivity of tumor samples to multiple drugs at once. Furthermore, we will develop model BioSI-DLM to use various perturbations (ex. SGA/LINCS perturbation data) as side information to learn better representation that potentially map latent variables in a DLM to biological entities. We hypothesize that the representation learned from our designed models will significantly improve the prediction accuracy compared with the conventional indication for drug treatment (ex. mutation state of the drug targeting protein). In summary, our study uses deep learning based machine learning methods to learn better and concise representation embedded in the cancer omics data to reflect the personalized genomic changes, which could be used to guide the personalized treatment. Our study could significantly contribute to the development of cancer ontology and promote the development of precision medicine. Project Narrative Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. The proposed project aims to develop machine learning methods, especially deep learning, to study cellular signaling systems and disease mechanism. A better representation embedded in the cancer omics data will improve the prediction of drug sensitivity and patient survival.

"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,10058252,F32CA233203,"['Antibodies ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Glycolysis ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' macrophage ', ' Mφ ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Metals ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' skin lesion ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Regulatory T-Lymphocyte ', ' Treg ', ' regulatory T-cells ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Sirolimus ', ' Rapamune ', ' Rapamycin ', ' Tissue Embedding ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' prognostic ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion ', ' SIMS Microscopy ', ' Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry Microscopy ', ' Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy Microscopy ', ' Spectroscopy, Mass, Secondary Ion ', ' Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization ', ' MALD-MS ', ' MALDI ', ' MALDI-MS ', ' Spectroscopy, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization ', ' matrix assisted laser desorption ionization ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' antibody conjugate ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' cutaneous tissue ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Formalin ', ' Skin ', ' fatty acid oxidation ', ' protein expression ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multiparametric Analysis ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Resolution ', ' Systemic Therapy ', ' SYS-TX ', ' mTOR Inhibitor ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Tumor Suppression ', ' Molecular Tumor Suppression ', ' Molecular ', ' Immunomodulators ', ' IMiD ', ' Immune modulatory therapeutic ', ' immune modulating agents ', ' immune modulating drug ', ' immune modulating therapeutics ', ' immune modulators ', ' immune modulatory agents ', ' immune modulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulating agents ', ' immunomodulatory agents ', ' immunomodulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulatory therapeutics ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' metabolic profile ', ' molecular diagnostics ', ' therapeutic biomarker ', ' therapeutic marker ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Growth Agents ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging ', ' Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ', ' nanometer resolution ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' effector T cell ', ' Teff cell ', ' Immune mediated destruction ', ' Immune destruction ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,38571
"A single cell view of the spatiotemporal nitrogen response in roots Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal seeks to investigate the mechanisms that mediate nutrient control of lateral root (LR) development by exploiting new single-cell expression data. The ultimate goal is to develop plants with enhanced nitrogen (N)-uptake and N-use-efficiency (NUE). This would help ameliorate the application of excess N-fertilizer - a main cause of water and air pollution that negatively impacts human health. Plant roots can sense levels of nitrate in the soil, which induces LR foraging for nutrients. LRs initiate post-embryonically from differentiated cells in the pericycle layer of the root, which de-differentiate to form “founder cells” that give rise to the post-embryonic LRs meristems. Thus, LRs are vital for root developmental plasticity and nutrient acquisition. Previous studies using GFP-marked cell lines, found that N-responses in roots are cell-type specific. However, those studies lacked the single-cell resolution and time-component necessary to identify the N- regulation of transitional states of cell-types (i.e. pericycle-to-founder cell). This proposal aims to: i) use single- cell N-response time-series data to create developmental trajectories that model the transition from pericycle-to- founder cells and ii) identify/validate TFs that regulate LR initiation in response to N-sensing. To do this, single- cell N-response transcriptome data will be analyzed from N-treated Arabidopsis thaliana roots (Aim 1). To determine the TFàtarget gene relationships in this dataset, cell-specific N-response data will be used to learn gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using a time-based machine learning algorithm called OutPredict. Next, the predicted TFàtarget gene interactions in the GRN will be validated using TARGET, a root cell-based TF perturbation assay (Aim 2). Finally, the function of candidate TFs in N-regulation of LR development and N- uptake will be validated in planta using TF mutants in phenotyping assays (Aim 3). In a preliminary in silico analysis of the outlined approach applied to existing single-cell data from Arabidopsis roots, intersected with N- responsive transcriptome data from whole roots identified: 1. A founder cell pseudotime trajectory and N- responsive TFs (Aim 1), 2. A founder cell N-response GRN that predicts TFàtarget gene interactions, and 3. A preliminary list of N-response TFs from founder cell trajectories (Table 2). These preliminary TFs will be phenotyped for their role in N-responsive LR development and 15N-uptake (Aim 3). This proposal will be the first to collect single-cell N-response data in planta and model LR development using developmental trajectory approaches. This proposal also provides new computational training in single cell-data analysis and machine learning methods for GRN to the PI, which will complement her experimental skills-set in plant molecular biology, and provide her with a multi-faceted research foundation for a career as an independent researcher. This project will also benefit from a sponsor environment with proven success for providing new training to the PI, as well as, the ideal laboratory and collaborator environment for the for the proposed single-cell and network modeling experiments. Project Narrative: The developmental plasticity of plants is enabled by their ability to change their root architecture post- embryonically, to acquire water and nutrients in a changing soil environment. This study specifically aims to identify the mechanisms by which nitrogen initiates the development of post-embryonic meristems in lateral roots. These studies will be used to guide strategies for generating crops that have enhanced lateral root growth and are more efficient at taking up nitrogen in the soil, to reduce the excess application of nitrogen-based fertilizes that negatively impact the environment and human health.",A single cell view of the spatiotemporal nitrogen response in roots,10235451,F32GM139299,"['Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Auxins ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell division ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Environment ', ' Fertilizers ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hazardous Chemicals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' nitrate ', ' Nitrogen ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plant Growth Regulators ', ' Phytohormones ', ' Plant Hormones ', ' Plants ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Soil ', ' Time ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water Pollution ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Mouse-ear Cress ', ' Arabidopsis thaliana ', ' Arabidopsis ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Meristem ', ' uptake ', ' Knowledge ', ' cell type ', ' gene interaction ', ' mutant ', ' single cell analysis ', ' success ', ' Nutrient ', ' skills ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' time use ', ' comparative ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,68562
"Prism-PET: A TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector technology for total-body PET imaging Abstract  The relatively small axial field-of-view (FOV) in almost all PET scanners has severely limited their sensitivity and resulted in significant tradeoffs between image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), acquisition time, and delivered dose. The solution is to improve geometric coverage using large axial FOV for total-body imaging which has the potential to improve sensitivity by about 40 times compared to existing commercial whole-body PET scanners. The construction of the world's first total-body PET/CT scan-ner, called EXPLORER, with 194-cm axial FOV has recently been completed. However, it has a poor time-of-flight (TOF) resolution of 430 ps, compared to the state-of-the-art whole-body PET scanner with 200 ps timing resolution (Siemens Biograph Vision). In addition, axial detector penetration of obliquely incident gamma photons detected within this wide acceptance angle will introduce significant depth-of-interaction (DOI) parallax error, leading to degraded spatial resolution. These two major defi-ciencies of the EXPLORER scanner offset its effective sensitivity gain, specially for imaging single organs such as the human brain when compared to the Biograph Vision PET scanner. For this research, we propose to build cost-effective block detectors with combined highest spatial resolution (2 mm), highest TOF resolution (<120 ps and potentially 100 ps), best DOI localization (1.85 mm), and highest inter- crystal Compton scatter recovery capabilities (88%) using single-ended readout and machine learning post-processing engines. Our novel detector module, called Prism-PET, enables these capabilities by mimicking very closely the behavior of dual-ended readout with enhanced and controlled light sharing using a segmented array of right angle prism-mirror light guides. Given our promising preliminary ex-perimental results, we aim to accomplish the following tasks: (1) model a prototype TOF-DOI PET scanner using GATE Monte Carlo simulations and use its list-mode data to develop our TOF-DOI image recontruction; (2) build Prism-PET detector modules and characterize coincidence detector blocks for DOI-corrected spatial resolution, energy resolution, and timing resolution and use machine learning to recover inter-crystal Compton scattered events to reach the 2-mm intrinsic spatial resolution without sacrificing sensitivity; (3) Build a one-ring prototype Prism-PET scanner; (4) perform normalization scan, optimize our image reconstruction using experimental coincidence events and validate the optimal imaging performance using Hot Spot phantoms. Our proposed TOF-DOI-Compton detector and system technologies maximize the sensitivity benefits of improved geometric coverage in total-body PET scanners across the entire FOV. Narratives/Relevance  The EXPLORER total-body PET scanner has limitations due to its poor timing resolution and lack of DOI-encoding, both of which offset its effective sensitivity gain, specially for imaging single organs, despite the very costly improvement of its geometric coverage. In the proposed work we will develop cost-effective and practical single-ended TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector modules, where these capabilities are enabled by using our novel right an-gle prism mirror light guides which enhance (1) light sharing by efficient 180-degree bending of photon paths and (2) crystal identification by localiz-ing the shared photons to only those immediate neighboring pixels that help with the correct identification. Our Prism-PET scanner with < 120 ps timing resolution, 1.85 mm DOI-encoding, and 88% Compton-scatter recovery miti-gates the limitations with the EXPLORER total-body scanner and achieves unparalleled spatial resolution and sensitivity.",Prism-PET: A TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector technology for total-body PET imaging,10233306,R01EB030413,"['positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Radiation Tolerance ', ' Radiation Sensitivity ', ' Radiosensitivity ', ' radio-sensitivity ', ' radiosensitive ', ' Research ', ' Rotation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Photons ', ' Custom ', ' Organ ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Recovery ', ' Collaborations ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' photomultiplier ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Process ', ' PET/CT scan ', ' PET/CT ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' cost effective ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' prototype ', ' risk mitigation ', ' Geometry ', ' Compton radiation ', ' Compton scattering ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calibration ', ' Crystallization ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Elements ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Industrialization ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' ']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,647165
"Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center (Overall Application) Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center - Overview Project Summary Musculoskeletal disorders remain an enormous public healthcare problem, accounting for more than fifty percent of chronic conditions in developed countries.

"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,10244988,R01GM130668,"['Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Vector-transmitted infectious disease ', ' Vector-borne disease ', ' Vector-borne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted disease ', ' vector-borne illness ', ' vectorborne disease ', ' vectorborne illness ', ' vectorborne infectious disease ', ' vector control ', ' time use ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' flu ', ' open source ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' computer infrastructure ', ' computational infrastructure ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' mathematical methods ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' climate variability ', ' climatic variability ', ' social media ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Twitter ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' economic determinant ', ' vector-borne ', ' vectorborne ', ' pathogen genomics ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' multiple data sources ', ' data infrastructure ', ' ZIKA ', ' data streams ', ' economic disparity ', ' meteorological data ', ' weather data ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Brazil ', ' Burn injury ', ' Burns ', ' burned ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' chikungunya ', ' Cities ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dengue ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Assimilations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' spreading factor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' Municipalities ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Influenza B ', ' Influenza Viruses Type B ', ' Orthomyxoviruses Type B ', ' Influenza B Virus ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' ']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,364519
"NeuroExplorer: Ultra-high Performance Human Brain PET Imager for Highly-resolved In Vivo Imaging of Neurochemistry Research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have been in place for over 40 years. The combination of quantitative PET systems with novel radiotracers has led to a numerous imaging para- digms to understand normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation. Brain-dedicated PET systems offer important advantages over currently available PET systems in terms of sensitivity and resolution. However, the state-of-the-art for brain PET has not progressed beyond the 20-year-old HRRT. Therefore, there is a compelling need to build the next generation of brain PET systems for human studies. This proposal brings together a highly experienced collaborative team from Yale, UC Davis, and United Imaging Healthcare America (UIHA). to develop the next generation NeuroEXPLORER (NX) PET system with the following Aims. Specific Aim 1: Design and Build the NeuroEXPLORER: In 2 years, we will complete the design and build the NX system. The design includes high performance LYSO-SiPM blocks with small detectors, 4-mm depth-of-interaction, 250 ps time-of-flight resolution, and axial length of ~50 cm, paired with CT for attenuation correction. This design will produce a factor of 10 greater effective sensitivity than the HRRT and practical resolution of 1.5-2 mm in the human brain. The system will include built-in real-time state-of-art motion tracking cameras and will be tested using novel phantom experiments to assess the full-range of operation to validate the dramatic improvement in small- region precision and accuracy. Specific Aim 2: Algorithm Development for Fully-Quantitative Brain PET. We will develop the novel algorithms for this system. Using EXPLORER experience. we will implement reconstruction algorithms to produce dynamic images with uniform ultra-high resolution in space and time, Extending Yale’s HRRT motion correction experience, we will develop camera-based motion detection and correction algorithms to deliver ultra-high resolution human brain images. Using the carotid artery shape and geometry, we will develop methods to accurately measure blood activity to be compared to human arterial data with the goal to permit kinetic modeling without arterial sampling. We will develop noise reduction methods with machine learning to reduce dose for studying health brains and to eliminate the need for the CT scan for attenuation correction. Specific Aim 3: Human Paradigm Demonstration. With human subjects, we will evaluate specific imaging paradigms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NX system: 1) demonstration of the dramatic sensitivity increase (with a direct comparison to the HRRT) and its impact on detection of pharmacologic effects, 2) leveraging high sensitivity to reliably measure uptake in small nuclei; and 3) opening new frontiers of imaging neurotransmitter dynamics, including dopamine and opioid release. The ultimate goal is a fully functioning and characterized system that dramatically expands the scope of brain PET protocols and applications. Human research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging have been in place for over 40 years and have led to a detailed understand of normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation. Brain-dedicated PET systems offer important advantages over currently available PET systems, but the state-of-the-art for brain PET imaging systems has not progressed beyond the 20-year-old HRRT. The proposed next generation NeuroEXPLORER (NX) PET system will have a factor of 10 greater sensitivity and will dramatically expand the scope of human brain PET protocols and applications.",NeuroExplorer: Ultra-high Performance Human Brain PET Imager for Highly-resolved In Vivo Imaging of Neurochemistry,10261504,U01EB029811,"['Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Carotid Arteries ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' locus ceruleus structure ', ' Locus Coeruleus ', ' Nucleus Pigmentosus Pontis ', ' blue nucleus ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Noise ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physics ', ' Physiology ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Proteins ', ' raphe nuclei ', ' Sensory Receptors ', ' Neural Receptors ', ' Neuroreceptors ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' statistics ', ' Substantia nigra structure ', ' Substantia Nigra ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' density ', ' human subject ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Evaluation ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' data quality ', ' uptake ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Inferior ', ' Brain scan ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' solid state ', ' neurotransmitter release ', ' attenuation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Radioactive ', ' Resolution ', ' Tracer ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' frontier ', ' 20 year old ', ' 20 years of age ', ' age 20 years ', ' twenty year old ', ' twenty years of age ', ' ultra high resolution ', ' operation ', ' Geometry ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' imaging system ', ' brain health ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imager ', ' algorithm development ', ' kinetic model ', ' ']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,2073986
"Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease Challenge, Innovation and Impact: In recent years, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict epidemic disease outbreaks from retrospective seasonal and geographical case data and to show that we can take climate factors into account in our predictive models. We are moving closer to real-time prediction at the population level. But we have never used prediction at point-of-care for treating the individual patient.  Presently, personalized medicine uses delayed results of laboratory testing of individuals. For infectious disease, most of such testing has targeted the pathogen in the host-pathogen interaction. The role of laboratory testing is to modify therapy after a variable period of time delay. Personalized medicine today is reactive. Complicating matters further, many infectious epidemic diseases are strongly dependent on environmental factors and climate. Lastly, we want to name the pathogens we are fighting, but we really need to know the resistance characteristics to select therapy for patients effectively. Both speciation and resistance can now be determined from molecular data, which can be integrated into point-of-care treatment predictions.  We here propose a radically different approach to the treatment of infectious diseases. Our hypothesis is that the alternative to time-delayed and expensive laboratory analysis of specimens from individual patients, is to use predictive modeling to forecast point-of-care treatment. Time-delayed personalized testing can be conducted as surveillance, and that data used for real-time prediction to guide point-of-care treatment.  We will introduce predictive personalized public health (P3H) policy at the individual patient level, with the potential to substantially improve patient outcomes compared with our present reactive approaches. Our key rationale is to expand population infectious disease predictive modeling in order to achieve prediction for treatment at point-of-care. Our primary insight is that we can reposition the delayed reactive personalized testing from the urgent medical decision-making process, and into a predictive modeling framework. The gaps and opportunities in technology that we will address are four-fold. First, we will employ individual case geospatial mapping at a fine scale to take into account infection spread and environmental factors. Second, our ability to perform pan-microbial analysis using molecular techniques is now feasible. Third, modeling our novel fusion of data has no simple low-dimensional solution – but machine learning technologies are now capable of handling such big data assimilation, model discovery and prediction. Fourth, our proposal is not an academic exercise. We have a partnership with the economic planners within a developing country to design and implement our new methods. We will prospectively tune and validate our algorithms in real-time. Our deliverable will be an open-source framework ready for clinical trials testing and adaptation to the public health infrastructure in any country. Project Narrative We have made substantial progress in our abilities to track and predict infectious disease epidemics at the population level, but prediction has never been used at the individual level to guide treatment at point-of-care. The individual treatment for all infectious disease syndromes at point-of-care is presently empirical, because laboratory testing is reactive and time delayed. We here propose a novel framework to use rigorous prediction strategies to guide point-of-care treatment for infectious diseases, and to validate this approach under real-world conditions.",Predictive Personalized Public Health (P3H): A Novel Paradigm to Treat Infectious Disease,10241253,R01AI145057,"['Algorithms ', ' Bacteriology ', ' Cholera ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' developing country ', ' developing nation ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exanthem ', ' Rash ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Exercise ', ' Fever ', ' Pyrexia ', ' febrile ', ' febris ', ' Geography ', ' Hand ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Infection ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Leptospirosis ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Measles ', ' Rubeola ', ' morbilli ', ' Melioidosis ', ' Meningitis ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Rain ', ' rainfall ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Genus staphylococcus ', ' Staphylococcus ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' Work ', ' Bacterial Meningitis ', ' Assimilations ', ' spreading factor ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fighting ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' authority ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' infectious disease treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' pathogen ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' flu ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' open source ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' surveillance data ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' resistance gene ', ' resistance locus ', ' resistant gene ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' Medical emergency ', ' climate data ', ' climatic data ', ' climatological data ', ' individual patient ', ' cost outcomes ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' acute infection ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data fusion ', ' antigen test ', ' antigen based test ', ' infant infection ', ' infected infant ', ' ']",NIAID,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2021,1650504
"Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative tracer images from combined PET-CT and PET-MR are increasingly being utilized for radiological decision-making and clinical trials. CT and MR based data corrections for PET photon attenuation, typically the largest impact on tracer quantification, can lead to increased radiation dose to the subject or require lengthy additional dedicated MR scans, respectively. Artificial intelligence algorithms that use the PET signal originating from the subject alone to estimate attenuation have shown promising early results, but, can have reduced performance when applied to exams different from the training data. Reconstruction methods that jointly estimate both the measured attenuation and tracer contrast from the subject PET signal represent a viable alternative, but, to date, have failed to match the quantification of CT approaches. Consequently, no single approach for PET attenuation correction that consistently produces high quantification and does not compromise patient safety or throughput currently exists. This is an important problem, since research and clinical findings must balance these practical issues with data quality. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and characterize a high performance attenuation correction scheme that utilizes both the PET signal from the subject and a variable activity external source. The central hypothesis is that the proposed reconstruction method will have significantly improved performance over reconstruction algorithms using PET signal originating from the subject alone, independent of the imaging study. The two specific aims include: 1) developing and validating a supplemental transmission-based algorithm for correcting PET images for photon attenuation during commercial PET imaging and 2) prototyping and characterizing a device capable of dynamically varying external source activity. The result of Aim 1 will be a reconstruction algorithm that is optimized to produce quantitative PET data for some of the most common clinical PET studies. Under Aim 2, a prototype device that can repeatability vary the external source activity in order to maximize tracer quantification while minimizing the unavoidable degradation to patient tracer image noise, caused by the introduction of any external source, will be produced. The innovation is an attenuation correction strategy that greatly mitigates the limitations of previous joint reconstruction methods to deliver quantitative PET diagnostics that are expected to match those of silver standard CT approaches. This is significant because the number of patients receiving brain and cardiac PET-CT scans, exams the proposed method is expected to benefit, is steadily increasing. For PET-MR, the method may improve tracer quantification where MR has limited performance and increase patient throughput by eliminating the need for non-diagnostic attenuation-only MR acquisitions. Thus, the proposed strategy has great potential to significantly improve radiological decision- making and clinical trial findings that rely on quantitative PET uptake measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to the public health because the development of a PET radiotracer attenuation correction strategy that is independent of the exam type, has the potential to improve the strength of research and clinical findings based on quantitative PET measurements. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIBIB's mission that pertains to enhancing existing imaging and bioengineering modalities.",Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging,10222671,R03EB028946,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Motion ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Public Health ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Radiation Scattering ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Silver ', ' Ag element ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Photons ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Neuroendocrine Tumors ', ' Neuroendocrine Neoplasm ', ' Training ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' uptake ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' respiratory ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' attenuation ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' 18-FDG ', ' 18F- FDG ', ' 18FDG ', ' 2 Fluoro 2 deoxy D glucose ', ' 2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose ', ' patient safety ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Radioactive ', ' Scheme ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Tracer ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' PET/CT scan ', ' PET/CT ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ', ' NIBIB ', ' reconstruction ', ' Joint repair ', ' joint reconstruction ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' prototype ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging study ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2021,86474
"Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema The goal of this proposed research is to reveal the sensory origins underlying the body schema representation. Body schema is the brain's internal model of the body's spatial configuration. This internal representation is critical for sensorimotor processing, movement control, and self-awareness, and is continuously updated during movement. Body schema representations are disrupted when somatosensory input is lost. The first step toward discover the neural correlates of body schema is to uncover neural mechanisms that generate body posture representation. We hypothesize that sensory inputs from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are transformed to construct a body posture representation.  To delineate the mechanisms underlying the neural coding of body posture, this project will utilize large- scale monitoring, apply interventional tools, develop new data analysis tools, and integrate new approaches. Our approach is to perform large-scale electrophysiological recording and novel markerless tracking of 3D posture in freely moving mice. To track posture, the first aim is to adapt a markerless tracking pipeline comprised of a deep 3D convolutional neural network to process high-speed videography of mouse behavior from multiple cameras. The second aim is to perform large-scale recording of neurons in S1, S2, and PPC and use advanced computational approaches to determine which postural features best explain the activity of neurons in these cortical areas. Finally, the third aim is to use optogenetic and projection-specific manipulations to address the causal impact of proprioceptive inputs from S1 and S2 on coding of posture in PPC. This research promises to uncover how sensory inputs are involved in generating the body schema representation and guiding behavior.  Extensive training will be required to carry out this project and achieve my goal of earning a tenure-track professor position. The rigorous methodological and intellectual environment in Dr. Fan Wang’s lab and the Duke Neurobiology community will advance my conceptual knowledge and technical skills. I will implement deep learning techniques through training and collaboration with specialists. I will learn new techniques by attending Neuropixel and computational neuroscience courses. Finally, I will develop my professional skills by frequent attendance of seminars, workshops, and meeting with a postdoctoral mentorship committee.  The proposed project will be conducted in the Department of Neurobiology at the Duke University Medical Campus. This interdisciplinary community at Duke will bolster the research and training included in this application through frequent interaction with talented and collaborative faculty, organization of seminars and symposia, numerous opportunities to practice research talks and receive valuable feedback, formation of a personalized postdoctoral mentorship committee, extensive career and professional training, and invaluable support from the postdoctoral association. Project Narrative Body schema, the brain’s internal model of the spatial configuration of its body parts, is normally updated during movement, but can be disrupted following amputation, stroke, or deafferentation. Understanding how neural circuits generate body schema representation in health and disease could pave the way for improvements in surgical practice, stroke recovery therapy, brain-machine interface technology, and prosthetic limb engineering. Furthermore, sustaining an internal model of the body is a key element of awareness of one’s own body and the body of others, so findings on the sensory origins underlying body schema will have implications ranging from sensorimotor processing, motor control, interpersonal representations, and social cognition.",Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema,10216941,F32MH122995,"['Affect ', ' Amputation ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Locomotion ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Posture ', ' Research ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Talents ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' career ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Body part ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Self Perception ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self image ', ' Self view ', ' self awareness ', ' self knowledge ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tactile ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' professor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' social cognition ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Motor ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Deafferentation procedure ', ' Deafferentation ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' stroke recovery ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' brain machine interface ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' somatosensory ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' motor control ', ' optogenetics ', ' neural correlate ', ' sensory input ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2021,66390
"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities Abstract: Diversity in the rates of progression and mortality of COVID-19 disease within infected African American (AAs) subgroups are clearly not just a function of the underlying health conditions that increase the rate of mortality for COVID -19 patients, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, but may also be affected by host genetic factors. Here we propose a series of studies to advance the understanding of our knowledge in relative to the health inequity in COVID-19 disease. This is a multiple-collaborative study between Genomic, Imaging research labs and Statistical studies. Research teams in Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) have established intimate relationships that position the institute to focus their research works on underserved minorities. We plan to develop and disseminate technological approaches in identifying host factors that disproportionately affect AAs COVID-19 infected patients. Given that the discovery, and establishment of translational implementation of novel solutions to health disparities in high-risk minority COVID-19 infected is our overall goals. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded on the X-chromosome, has been shown to be a functional receptor for COVID-19 to enter host target cells and the concern might arise regarding whether ACE2 variants between and within subgroups would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infected patients. Therefore, the long-term goal is to compare how genetic variants of the ACE2 receptor, chemokine (CCL2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (influence the immune system’s response to viruses and bacteria), affects COVID-19 disease severity among people but no underlining disease like diabetes, heart or lung disease with those with mild or no disease manifestations. Short-term goal; we will focus on two aims; Aim: 1-Determine genetic variations in ACE2 gene on obtained DNA samples from COVID-19 infected patients and evaluate for potential correlation between ACE2 variant frequencies in relationship to COVID-19 disease progression and mortalities between and within AAs and non-Hispanic Caucasian CAs subgroup;. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which uses host cell ACE2, TMPRSS2, EZRIN and other proteins for entry. Differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2/EZRIN genes expression and SNPs may justify the disease disparity and aim 2 will address how COVID-19 spike engagement with host cell receptor is precisely regulated and how host cells respond to cytokines elicited by COVID-19 infection using lung organoids. A recent correlation study suggested that the decrease expression of ACE2 /TMPRSS2/EZRIN are predictors of decreased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and could be attributed to COVID-19 morbidity in Africa American patients. Aim-2: Modeling COVID-19-elicited disease disparity using lung organoids. Clinical validation of ACE2 and EZRIN will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome and mortality gaps between African American and Caucasians patients. . Given the facts of a significant racial disparity in COVID-19 disease among African American (AA) and Caucasians, there is an utmost need to understand the COVID-19 infectivity host factors biology. Apart from socioeconomic factors and underlying comorbidities, AA clearly differ from Caucasians on a number of accounts, including COVID-19 mortalities genetic predisposition, which favors for high incidence and mortality rate COVID- 19 disease manifestations. Studies clearly demonstrate that ACE 2 encoded on the X-chromosome which COVID-19 virus use to entry host may be differentially expressed among individuals, therefore, we propose to determine that ACE2 and other genes, such as Ezrin plays vital role in regulating the COVID-19 virus infectivity resulting in racial disparity and the clinical validation of ACE2 and ezrin will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome gaps between African American and Caucasians.",Center for Translational Research in

"Integrating genomic and clinical data to predict disease phenotypes using heterogeneous ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Genomic and other “omic” profiles hold immense potential for advancing personalize/precision medicine by enabling the accurate prediction of disease phenotypes or outcomes for individual patients, which can be used by a clinician to design an appropriate plan of care. However, despite this potential, the actual impact of these omic profiles on disease phenotype prediction may be limited by the fact that even large cohorts collecting these data do not cover large enough numbers of individuals. In contrast, a variety of clinical data types, such as laboratory tests and physician notes, are routinely collected and studied for a much larger number of patients undergoing treatment for such diseases at medical centers. The abundance of these clinical data, and their complementarity with multi-omic data, offer an opportunity to advance personalized medicine by integrating these disparate types of data. However, this disparity in data formats, namely several omic profiles being structured, and several clinical data types, such as physician notes, being unstructured, poses challenges for this integration. An associated challenge due to this disparity is that different classes of computational methods are likely to be the most effective for predicting disease phenotypes from these clinical and omics datasets. These challenges pose barriers for current data integration methods to address this problem. Here, we propose an innovative approach to this integration by assimilating diverse base phenotype predictors inferred from individual clinical and omics datasets into heterogeneous ensembles. These ensembles, which have shown promise for several other computational genomics problems, can aggregate an unrestricted number and variety of base predictors, which is ideal for this integration problem. Specifically, we describe how existing heterogeneous ensemble methods for single datasets can be transformed and advanced to address the multiple clinical and omic dataset integration problem. In particular, we detail novel algorithms for improving these integrative ensembles by modeling and incorporating the inherent patient and dataset heterogeneity in these datasets. We also propose novel algorithms for leveraging the inherent complementarity among clinical and omic datasets, as well as an innovative approach for handling expected missing data, both with the goal of making ensemble phenotype predictors more accurate and applicable to patient cohorts. To assess the performance of this novel suite of data integration-oriented heterogeneous ensembles, we will validate their effectiveness for predicting asthma and Inflammatory Bowel Disease phenotypes in substantial patient cohorts with diverse omics and clinical datasets. We will publicly release efficient software implementations of the methods developed in this project to enable others to carry out similar analyses with other diverse data collections. Successful accomplishment of the proposed work will contribute to the advancement of personalized medicine through accurate individualized prediction of disease phenotypes. Predictive modeling is expected to become a cornerstone on the path to achieving precision/personalized medicine, as one of the key tasks here will be making individualized predictions of disease characteristics/phenotypes like subtype and risk of progression and/or recurrence. We propose several innovative computational algorithms for developing accurate predictive models that integrate diverse clinical and omic data, as well as several rigorous validation exercises that will demonstrate the capabilities of these models.

"Multimodal monitoring and high-dimensional data for episode prediction in bipolar disorder SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder with high recurrence and disability rates, high economic burden, and an estimated suicide risk 20 times higher than the general population. While efficacious treatment is available, BD patients spend a large proportion of their life symptomatic. Predicting the onset of episodes is a valuable strategy to decrease suicide and disability rates and to optimize healthcare costs. The overall objective of this (R21) Exploratory/Developmental study is to obtain pilot data to support the feasibility and potential value of a new approach to predict mood episodes in stable adult patients with BD. This proposal aims to develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time. To do so, we propose integrating multimodal, high-dimensional telemonitoring data, nonlinear techniques and artificial intelligence classification systems. This approach builds on our preliminary work on: (i) nonlinear techniques for the study of mood regulation in BD; (ii) an award-winning simulation using a machine learning technique (Markov Brains) for episode prediction in BD. AIMS: Aim 1 (feasibility): To obtain and integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels in 90 euthymic BD adults. Exploratory Aim 2 (potential value): To use machine learning techniques (Markov Brains) to distinguish participants at higher risk for a depressive or manic relapse based on their time-series and entropy levels (from Aim 1). HYPOTHESES: H1: We will be able to collect enough data in 80% of our participants and to integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels. H2: Markov Brains will identify participants at higher risk for a mood episode based on high (vs. low) auto-correlated time-series and low (vs. high) entropy levels. SIGNIFICANCE: This R21 application challenges more traditional prediction models by conceptualizing inter- and intra-individual variability as a dynamic property of biological systems. By leveraging densely-sampled objective and subjective data, autonomic, clinical and demographic data, this proposal aims to develop inference techniques that will examine changes within each individual, over time, in order to enhance the estimation performance. Ultimately, if we develop the capacity to predict mood episodes, we should be able to prevent them. NARRATIVE The proposed research is clinically relevant as it could develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time, in order to predict mood changes indicative of an imminent episode of illness in bipolar disorder.

"Dynamic µOCT for cellular tissue phenotyping Phenotyping cells and tissue is a critical function that spans basic science to clinical diagnosis. Yet, established methods for phenotyping cells in tissue are static, are evaluated when the tissue is dead, and typically involve destruction of the sample. This paradigm misses an entire dimension represented by cellular function and activity, information that is potentially of great significance in understanding cell/tissue state. Recently, a new field has emerged that uses coherence-gated imaging to quantify living tissue motion as a proxy of cellular function and activity. Coherence-based motility imaging is relatively new - much remains to be learned about the nature of its dynamic signal. In addition, many of the coherence-gated technologies described to date lack the resolution to investigate individual cells. The ones that are capable of seeing cells do not provide cross-sectional images and thus miss important architectural patterns associated with tissue maturation. We have developed a form of coherence-gated imaging called 1-µm optical coherence tomography (µOCT). µOCT has a resolution of 1 µm axial by 2 µm lateral, enabling cross-sectional visualization of tissue at the cellular level. Recently, we have discovered that by sequentially acquiring multiple µOCT images and computing the pixel-per-pixel power spectrum, we observe a dramatic increase in image contrast and new information emerging from the µOCT datasets. Preliminary studies with this new technology, termed dynamic µOCT (DµOCT), suggest that it can be used to visualize epithelial maturation, cell death/apoptosis, and cellular activity. In this grant, we will mature this technology by conducting key validation studies in a variety of clinically relevant human tissues, animal models, and spheroids to understand the dynamic signal and determine its accuracy for diagnosing pathology, activity, and response to therapy (apoptosis/necrosis) (Aim 1). We also will advance DµOCT further by increasing spatial and temporal resolution, creating new data mining analysis pipelines, and developing and validating technology and probes that enable DµOCT to be implemented in vivo (Aim 2). By expanding our understanding and implementation of this exciting technology, we hope to provide a powerful new tool that will have significant and wide-reaching impact in the biological and clinical sciences. In this proposal we will develop a cross-sectional imaging technology termed dynamic µOCT (DµOCT) that identifies distinct cells and tissues using intracellular motility signatures, a proxy of cell activity and state. Research will involve conducting a series of experiments in spheroids, animals, and human tissue to understand the nature of the dynamic signal and determine the diagnostic capacity of this technology for distinguishing disease, cell/tissue activity, and response to therapy. We additionally will develop next generation DµOCT technology that will increase resolution, provide more powerful diagnostic algorithms, and enable the use of DµOCT in living patients.",Dynamic µOCT

"Administrative Equipment Supplement for GM135160 PROJECT SUMMARY Cellular shape change is a fundamental characteristic of metazoan cells that is key to development, physiology, and pathology. The formation and plasticity of neural networks are key examples of cell shape change during development and physiology, whereas cell shape and motility goes awry in cancers such as melanoma. The active control of the cytoskeleton is acknowledged as critical to cellular shape change, whereas the concurrent remodeling of the plasma membrane is perhaps less well appreciated. Although many cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling components are known and their biochemical and structural characteristics described, we lack a systematic understanding of how these disparate systems are regulated and coordinated to orchestrate cellular shape change. Perhaps the most important problem in cell morphogenesis is understanding how cells perceive cues in their environment and convert this extracellular information into shape changes through coordinated cytoskeletal dynamics and plasma membrane remodeling. Functions of small GTPases and kinases are well studied in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane remodeling. Work from my lab identified an emerging role for E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulated cellular shape change. We identified two E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRIM9 and TRIM67, which regulate cytoskeletal and exocytic proteins and cellular shape changes in response to netrin. Netrin is an extracellular morphogen that promotes neuronal morphogenesis and the progression of cancers, such as melanoma. TRIM9 and TRIM67 thus provided an excellent entry point for the lab to investigate how cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling are coordinated during netrin triggered morphogenesis and motility. TRIM9 and TRIM67 share similar sequences, localization, and interaction partners, however our studies identified distinct functions of these related proteins and antagonistic phenotypes associated with their deletion. The overarching goal of this program is to test the hypothesis that TRIM9 and TRIM67 coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics and exocytosis during netrin-dependent morphogenesis in neurons and migrating melanoma cells. Our work will provide fundamental mechanistic understanding of the regulation of the cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking during development and metastasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cellular shape change is a fundamental characteristic of cells, key to development, physiology, and pathology. The morphogen netrin promotes neuronal development and cancer progression, yet we know little about how cells interpret netrin into shape changes.

"Precision Mass Spec Imaging Based Structure-Function Signatures of Diabetic Glomerulopathy Project Summary/Abstract There are currently >450,000 patients on dialysis and ~120,000 patients will have to begin dialysis each year in the United States. Along with a marked reduction in quality of patient life, the cost to the US Medicare system is in excess of $114B per year. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing new platforms that will enhance the drug development process for new therapies to reduce the rate of progression to end-stage kidney disease. Non-invasive biomarkers may be useful but do not directly identify the pathways linked to pathology in the kidney. An approach that integrates tissue structure with functional readouts in a kidney biopsy would be a major advance. We are developing a computational platform that leverages mass spec imaging data coupled with computational pathology for kidney tissue as a technology that will address this unmet need. With our computational platform we can identify signatures linked to normal and abnormal pathology on the same tissue section. This is a powerful approach to understand kidney pathology and will be of great value for drug development for kidney disease. Parameters related to reproducibility across pre-clinical models of diabetic kidney disease interpretation will be optimized during Phase I. Upon completion of the SBIR Phase I project we will have rigorous data to determine consistency of diseased glomerular signatures in diabetic nephropathy. This proof of concept data will make it attractive to pharma and biotech to adopt this platform for application for their therapeutic programs for diabetic kidney disease. Project Narrative Existing technologies only identify altered structures in kidney biopsies without providing insight into why the pathology is there and progressing. With the new computational platform incorporating mass spec imaging data coupled to computational pathology developed at SygnaMap we can localize functional alterations of diseased structures in a biopsy. By establishing reproducibility in our technology with this Phase I SBIR, we will offer pharma disease-relevant targets to develop precision therapies for patients with diabetic kidney

"Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses The natural immune response to foreign pathogens involves a complex coordination of cells, including an adaptive response to select and secrete antibodies into circulation. Individuals who have recovered from a pathogenic infection retain immune memory and continue to circulate pathogen-specific antibodies. For many infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola, and poxviruses, antibodies with neutralizing activity to multiple viral strains have been discovered from human survivors. The discovered antibodies are highly valuable as potential biologic therapeutics for the broader population, as the antibodies have been naturally optimized to defend against human pathogens.  Efforts to discover antibodies from humans recovering from coronavirus infection are underway, SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but are hampered by the limitations of existing antibody discovery platforms. Current approaches require screening for live B cells actively producing pathogen-specific antibodies, which are sensitive to cell death and rarely found in blood. In contrast, antibody protein is stable and pathogen-reactive antibodies are abundant in serum. While protein is the ideal material to start with, characterization of polyclonal antibody (pAb) protein presents new challenges.  Recent advances in mass spectrometry and analysis have shown individual antibody candidates can be derived from affinity-purified pAb proteins when a sufficiently matched B-cell genetic antibody repertoire is provided. We aim to develop algorithms to supplant the need of a genetic antibody repertoire, and de novo identify antibody candidates from limited complexity pAb samples. This is achieved by improvements to de novo peptide sequencing using machine learning, and targeted assembly of specificity determining regions (CDR3s) and antibody frameworks using de Bruijn graphs. The proposed software will provide estimates of clonal diversity and candidate sequences that can be synthesized and tested for reactivity. In addition to addressing needs for infectious diseases, as demonstrated with an urgent unmet need to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the software also applies to clinical and biomedical research needs in autoimmune disease, and commercial interests in replacing polyclonal antibody reagents with highly reproducible monoclonal antibody equivalents. The antibody repertoire circulating in serum is the most active component to an immune response, yet is unable to be directly queried without aid from the genetic antibody repertoire from cells. Our innovative algorithms enable querying and sequencing of antibodies directly from protein - opening the door to previously inaccessible autoimmune and infectious disease research and therapeutic antibody discovery.",Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses,10477662,R44GM140607,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', '

"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Abstract Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease. The assay can be completed in less than 25 min allowing for rapid in office results to support clinical diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is critical to prevent disease progression and sequelae; however current laboratory diagnostics that are used to support clinical diagnosis are insensitive during early infection, failing ~50% of the time. We propose the development of a sensitive and specific multi-antigen point-of-care assay that will provide immediate serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to aid in physician diagnosis. Accurate, rapid diagnosis will improve patient outcomes by reducing the likelihood of developing potentially debilitating late stage disease through early antibiotic intervention.",A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease,10404209,R44AI150060,"['Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Bacterial Proteins ', ' Bacterial Gene Products ', ' Bacterial Gene Proteins ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi ', ' B burgdorferi ', ' B. burgdorferi ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ', ' Lyme Disease Spirochete ', ' lyme spirochete ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Laboratory Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' Immunoglobulin M ', ' 19S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgM ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Musculoskeletal System ', ' locomotor system ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Paper ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Physicians ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' DBL Oncoprotein ', ' oncogene protein DBL ', ' p66 ', ' protein DBL ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Serology ', ' OspC protein ', ' Outer surface protein C ', ' ospC ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Spottings ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' Speed ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' cross reactivity ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' ImProv ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' CD61 ', ' CD61 Antigens ', ' GP IIIa ', ' GP3A ', ' GPIIIa ', ' ITGB3 ', ' Integrin Beta 3 ', ' Integrin beta3 ', ' Integrin β3 ', ' NAIT ', ' PTP gene ', ' Platelet Fibrinogen Receptor, Beta Subunit ', ' Platelet GPIIIa ', ' Platelet Glycoprotein IIIa ', ' Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIIa ', ' ITGB3 gene ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' multiplex detection ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' cost effective ', ' blind ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Microbe ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' relapsing fever borrelia ', ' decorin binding protein B ', ' DbpB ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' efficacy testing ', ' point-of-care diagnostics ', ' biological systems ', ' screening ', ' Borrelia miyamotoi ', ' B miyamotoi ', ' B. miyamotoi ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' preservation ', ' antibody detection ', ' antibody based detection ', ' detect antibodies ', ' rapid test ', ' rapid assay ', ' rapid tests ', ' point-of-care detection ', ' detection assay ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' point of care testing ', ' ']",NIAID,"BIOPEPTIDES, INC.",R44,2021,948000
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction SUMMARY Single-cell sequencing technologies provide great opportunities for studying biology and medicine, but computational analyses are often the bottlenecks to reveal biological insights and define cellular heterogeneity underlying the data. The applications of machine learning (ML), especially deep learning hold great promises to address the challenges. While ML studies from various labs, including the PI’s lab, have made significant progress along this line, the involvement of the ML community in single-cell data analysis is limited due to the barriers of technology complexity and biology knowledge. To attract more ML experts into this field, the PI proposes to make large-scale single-cell sequencing data ML-ready and provide an ML-friendly development environment. Specific aims include: (1) Collect, process, and manage diverse single-cell sequencing data to make them ML-ready. We will collect single-cell sequencing data from public sources and convert them into formats efficient for storage and handling. The data will be processed with multiple options, such as imputation, normalization, and dimension reduction using a pipeline to be developed. (2) Configure the data into benchmarks. We will use the collected data to build benchmarks, gather public benchmarks, and encourage the community to submit their benchmarks. The data will be divided into training, validation, and test sets in multiple settings, including a minimum viable benchmark to assist efficient method development and a comprehensive benchmark for full evaluations. We will develop utilities to evaluate results based on a set of assessment measures, and generate detailed reports. We will select a set of public tools to run them on the benchmarks as baselines for others to compare with. (3) Provide an integrated development environment (IDE) to support partial method development. We will build an IDE for single-cell sequencing analysis method development with plug-and-play features at the code level and web interface for ML researchers to contribute and test any minimum new ideas. A report will be provided containing evaluation metrics and usage of computer resources, comparisons with some public tools, and downstream visualization and interpretation. The newly formatted data, the benchmarks, and the method development and assessment environment will be available at GitHub and the in-house single-cell data analysis web portal DeepMAPS. The proposed research is a natural extension of the parent grant (R35-GM126985), which aims to develop deep- learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including (1) developing general unsupervised representations and making deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (2) applying deep-learning models to a wide range of bioinformatics problems, and (3) making the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. Thanks to the flexibility of the R35 mechanism, the PI’s lab extended these methods to single-cell data analyses, which well-prepared the lab for the proposed tasks. Project Narrative: Relevance to Public Health Single-cell sequencing is becoming one of the most powerful biotechnologies in studying diseases, such as cancers and Alzheimer’s disease. Machine learning can play a prominent role to better utilize single-cell sequencing data, but the involvement from the machine learning community is limited due to various technical barriers related to data complexity and development environment. Hence, in this project, we will collect and process hundreds of single-cell sequencing data sets, form benchmarks, and provide an integrated development environment to help more machine learning researchers develop methods for single-cell sequencing data analyses.",Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction,10409152,R35GM126985,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Head ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Ohio ', ' Play ', ' Problem Formulations ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' data integration ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' web interface ', ' tool development ', ' parent grant ', ' data format ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' learning community ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' Formulation ', ' single cell technology ', ' online resource ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Visualization ', ' data complexity ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2021,234750
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Comparative Modeling of Effective Policies for Colorectal Cancer Control ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The long-term goal of our proposed project is to reduce the population burden of CRC by providing the information needed to address key policy questions across the CRC control continuum in an accessible and transparent manner. To accomplish this goal we will use our population-based microsimulation models to: 1) Evaluate the impact of screening as practiced in the US; 2) Inform the debate about the increase in CRC incidence before age 50; 3) Consider the effectiveness of precision of screening and surveillance; 4) Address other emerging issues and opportunities in CRC control; and 5) Use novel methods to improve model accessibility and transparency. Our team will fill critical gaps in knowledge, enabling decision makers to act. New evidence that we will incorporate in our models to better inform CRC control opportunities will be 1) updated information on screening patterns in the US (in collaboration with the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimen, or PROSPR), 2) data on the increased risk of CRC in persons under age 50 (in collaboration with Rebecca Siegal of the American Cancer Society, who did the seminal work in this area), and 3) state-of-the art colonoscopy screening data to incorporate alternative carcinogenesis pathways in the natural history models (in collaboration with the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry). We will synthesize and incorporate the growing body of evidence in the literature to assess the clinical utility of personalized screening and treatment, as well as the potential role for novel computer-aided detection and diagnosis modalities. We will expand our models to project clinical and resource-based outcomes for middle-income countries that are considering the implementation of a screening program. Lastly, there is a critical need to make our models assessible and transparent. To this end we will use high performance computing approaches to develop and apply deep- learning methods for model calibration and model emulation, which will aid in model sharing. The three participating modeling groups are well positioned to carry out this work, bringing a wealth of experience, expertise, and insight to issues related to microsimulation modeling of CRC, and have a proven track record of collaboration and disseminating our work to health policy decision makers.

"Computational methods for optimized biologics formulation Project Summary: Protein-based biologics – therapeutics whose active ingredient is a protein and most commonly a monoclonal antibody (mAb) – make up a $200 billion/year market that is expected to double in size by 2025. A critical component in the safety and efficacy of biologics is the need to maintain the active protein during long-term storage and subsequent injection/infusion. The selection of excipients and buffers toward this end is termed “formulation.” Proper formulation of a protein-based drug is essential to stabilize the active protein from unfolding and to block sites on the folded protein that may pose an aggregation risk and lead to elevated viscosity due to undesirable protein-protein interactions (PPI). Importantly, formulation can be done without altering the sequence of (i.e. re-engineering) the protein and is thus an independent tool for bringing a biologic therapeutic to market. Current approaches to choosing an optimized formulation are either low-throughput experiments or computational methods that do not take into account the molecular details of excipient-protein interactions. The established Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS) computational platform technology maps the affinity pattern of the complete 3D surface of a protein for a wide diversity of chemical functional groups. The functional group affinity pattern is then used to determine excipients that can bind to and stabilize the active, folded conformation of a protein and bind to regions of the protein that may participate in PPI, thereby inhibiting aggregation and decreasing viscosity. The broad goal of the proposal is the continued development and validation of SILCS-Biologics as an industry-ready workflow and a graphical user interface to manage and apply the extensive information generated by SILCS excipient screening and PPI analysis. In the proposed studies experimental efforts will be undertaken to generate data for model training and validation across a variety of proteins and commonly used excipients. That data will be then combined with computed SILCS metrics including excipient binding locations and affinities and potential regions that can participate in PPI across the complete protein surface, including the impact of pH and the unique properties of Arginine as an excipient. This information will then be applied in the context of machine learning to develop models that will predict excipients that will block PPI thereby lowering viscosity and slowing aggregation as well as stabilize the folded, biologically active state of the protein. The proposed models will be validated at the University of Maryland, Baltimore and with industrial and government partners against established experimental methods on a range of proteins with various therapeutic indications. Upon successful completion of the project new offerings will be added to the existing SILCS software suite that will minimize the time and costs requirements for the formulation of biologics as well as lead to improved formulations thereby improving clinical outcomes. These capabilities will be implemented in the context of industry-ready workflows for direct sale to pharmaceutical companies and for use in contract research for the optimized formulation of biologics. Project Narrative: Biopharmaceuticals, including monoclonal antibodies, represent a growing and important area of new therapeutic agent development, but the formulation of biopharmaceuticals remains a bottleneck. Proposed is the continuation of a successful Phase 1 effort to use a rational formulation design technology using computational methods to allow screening of a large number of excipient/buffer combinations that will result in accelerated and improved biopharmaceutical development thereby facilitating bringing these agents to market as well as improving clinical outcomes.",Computational methods for optimized biologics formulation,10257518,R44GM130198,"['Adoption ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Products ', ' Biologic Products ', ' Biological Agent ', ' biopharmaceutical ', ' biotherapeutic agent ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Buffers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Excipients ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligands ', ' Lysine ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Maps ', ' Maryland ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Probability ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Sales ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Viscosity ', ' Work ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' injection/infusion ', ' success ', ' functional group ', ' Structure ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Protein Region ', ' Recombinants ', ' Research Contracts ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' usability ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' commercialization ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' FDA approved ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' screening ', ' Formulation ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' ']",NIGMS,"SILCSBIO, LLC",R44,2021,829462
"Uncovering the epitranscriptome regulatory codes using machine learning Project Summary N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant methylation widely found in mRNAs of mammalian cells whose function is largely unknown. Recent research has accumulated increasingly strong evidence of m6A's involvement in different diseases such as leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, and AIDs. While m6A's close involvement in many diseases is apparent, mechanistic evidence linking m6A alterations to disease phenotypes is mostly missing. Most of the recent research is fueled by the high throughput sequencing technologies such as MeRIP-seq for transcriptome-wide profiling of m6A methylation. However, due to the innate limitations of such technologies, sophisticated machine learning based algorithms are urgently needed to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels and the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A. Without bridging these knowledge gaps, it is impossible to made inroads to the problem of finding m6A's role in regulating diseases. To address these issues, our aims in this proposal are 1) Establish a deep learning algorithm for base-resolution m6A site prediction; 2) Establish base- resolution m6A differential site prediction using a hierarchical Bayesian approach; and 3) Determine m6A- mediated genes and functions by Bayesian Negative-Binomial regression. The proposed research will employ deep learning and adversarial learned inference methods and utilize both methylation quantification and sequence information for the first time. Also, it will employ Bayesian graphical model-based methods for combining sequence and methylation level information. It is expected that the developed algorithms will have broad applications in functional study, for which we plan to closely work with our collaborators in applying these algorithms in their research of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which will lead to the fulfillment our long term goal in the eventual validation and practical medical application of m6A research in the future. Project Narrative  This project proposes to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels, the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure is an important step towards understanding of biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. Although experimental structure determination has been greatly improved, there is still a very large gap between the number of available protein sequences and that of solved protein structures, which can only be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing sequence, structure and functional data and to develop data-driven computational methods and tools for structure and functional prediction. We believe that by developing sophisticated algorithms to extract knowledge from the increasing sequence and structure data, we can model protein sequence-structure relationship very accurately and improve structure and functional prediction greatly. This project has already produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data- driven algorithms and web servers (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for protein structure modeling. This renewal will further develop machine learning (especially deep learning) algorithms for protein structure modeling without good templates. The specific aims are: (1) developing deep learning (DL) algorithms for the prediction of protein contact and distance matrix; (2) developing distance-based algorithms for fast and accurate ab initio folding of proteins without templates; (3) developing DL algorithms for template-based modeling with only weakly similar templates. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure relationship and yield publicly available resources for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing our web servers to study a wide variety of proteins relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure relationship and to predict protein structures. The results will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as better understanding of disease processes, development of novel diagnostics and drugs, and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.",New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction,10246779,R01GM089753,"['Abbreviations ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Crystallography ', ' Crystallographies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Sequence Homologs ', ' Homologous Sequences ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' protein structure function ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' protein complex ', ' Torsion ', ' Protein Family ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' Geometry ', ' model building ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' web server ', ' ']",NIGMS,TOYOTA TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE / CHICAGO,R01,2021,321599
"Big-Data Electron-microscopy for Novel Community Hypotheses: Measuring And Retrieving Knowledge (BENCHMARK) Project Summary In an effort to better understand structural organization and anatomy of nervous systems at unprecedented spatial resolution, recent efforts, including BRAIN Initiative funded projects, have collected increasingly larger datasets using Electron Microscopy (EM) and X-Ray Microtomography (XRM). We can now image neural tissue across a range of different scales, potentially forming the basis for the next generation of brain atlases at submicron and nanometer resolution. However, there is huge variability in data collection approaches, as well as ongoing research into evolving imaging technology, experimental protocols, data storage, and post- processing methods. Different resolutions, contrasts, staining, image corrections, data compression, machine learning algorithms, and metadata are all being developed. To enable comparison, meta-analysis, and registration with other datasets and imaging modalities, new standards for EM and XRM data are required, similar to those pursued in light microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, and other domains. In this time period of growth in EM and XRM imaging, and its increased adoption and utilization for neuroscientific investigations, it is a critical time to implement standards that ensure interoperability, sustainability, and availability of these expensive datasets. This will be critical to enable openness, sharing between laboratories, and reproducible results on these large and expensive datasets. This proposal aims to develop standards for large scale EM and XRM structural data, as well as standards for annotations and links to complementary data sources. This will enable validation, sharing, and replication, greatly amplifying investment in other BRAIN initiative projects in this community. Our team will bring together a community of researchers into two complementary Working Groups (WGs) for Image and Experimental Metadata Standards and Annotation Standards. This community of interest will collaboratively develop standards and disseminate results in conjunction with BRAIN initiative projects and archives. Finally, this project will build tools to query and retrieve image and annotation data, including motif discovery, through a community portal and open source tools. This will allow scientists to reproducibly analyze data, test hypotheses, and share data products and results with the community. We will emphasize collaboration with existing standards across communities and the development and integration of software tools supporting the standards to ensure adoption. Project Narrative We propose the development of imaging and annotations data standards for the Electron Microscopy and X-ray Microtomography research communities. These standards will enable analysis and discovery on a new generation of large-scale nano- and micro-scale neuroanatomical and connectomics datasets.

"Robust AI to develop risk models in retinopathy of prematurity using deep learning ROP is a retinal neovascular disease affecting preterm infants, and is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Known clinical risk factors include preterm birth, low birthweight and use of supplemental oxygen but improved risk models are needed to identify infants that progress to treatment requiring disease and blindness. Deep learning techniques have been used to successfully identify “plus” disease in multi- institutional cohorts and to provide a continuous measure of disease severity. A major limitation of deep learning, however, is the need for large amounts of well curated datasets. Other limitations include overfitting and “brittleness” that can cause model performance to drop on external data. There are, however, numerous barriers to building and hosting these large central repositories with multi-institutional data required for robust deep learning including concerns about data sharing, regulations costs, patient privacy and intellectual property. In this project, we aim to demonstrate the utility of distributed/federated deep learning approaches where the data are located within institutions, but model parameters are shared with a central server. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Specifically, we seek to build robust risk models for predicting treatment requiring disease. Two large cohorts will be used to validate the hypothesis that the performance of the risk models using distributed learning approaches that of centrally hosted and is more robust than models built on single institutional datasets.

"Improving membrane proteins' 3D reconstructions with cryo-electron microscopy While the development of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has already proven to revolutionize the field of structural biology by imaging biomolecules in solution, the vast majority of proteins cannot be reconstructed at a satisfying resolution. Among them, membrane proteins still remain an imaging challenge for biologists - despite being prominent targets for over half of prescription drugs on the pharmaceutical market. The proposed work develops a novel mathematical and statistical method that will enhance the resolution of cryo-EM, targeting the 3D imaging and reconstruction of membrane proteins.   The main challenges that we solve, and the novelty of this approach, come from statistics and differential geometry. From a statistical perspective, the proposal revisits the paradigm of cryo-EM shape reconstruction, by replacing the traditional ""expectation-maximization"" learning procedure by its faster and scalable counterpart, called ""variational inference"". In order to apply ""variational inference"" in this context, our solution implements the differential geometry of 3D shape spaces within the recent and popular dimension reduction method of ""variational autoencoders"". By improving the efficiency of the image reconstruction algorithm, while benchmarking its accuracy, we leverage the extraordinary amount of raw data produced by cryoEM. In turn, processing more data improves the resolution of the reconstructed biomolecular shapes. The originality of the proposed project is to leverage statistics and mathematics that have not yet penetrated the communities of machine learning and biological imaging. Our proposal is also broadly applicable beyond cryo-EM and biological imaging. Reconstructing biomolecular shapes is the focus of several imaging modalities, such as coherent diffraction for single particle imaging, that produce images whose analysis is an on-going research of members of our team. The proposal translates to the representation of shapes for these technologies. The proposal addresses technical topics that are pivotal for pharmaceutical and medical research. Our long-term vision is to advance knowledge on membrane proteins' 3D structures when bound to FDA-approved drugs, and facilitate structure-based drug design with improved selectivity.

"The influence of ocular remodeling on glaucoma Abstract Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, yet the reason for retinal ganglion cell damage within the optic nerve head (ONH) is not fully understood. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered the primary cause of glaucoma, but epidemiologic studies identify moderate or high myopia as an independent risk factor. Currently, the connection between these two diseases is unknown. We propose that there is a biomechanical basis underlying this interaction. Our central hypothesis is that scleral and ONH remodeling that leads to high myopia is one of many factors increasing the risk for subsequent pathologic ONH remodeling and glaucoma later in life. With myopia reaching epidemic proportions in portions of the world, and the prevalence of glaucoma continuing to increase, understanding the basic mechanisms underlying these disease processes is critical. We will leverage our unique tree shrew model of experimental myopia and glaucoma, a combination of in vivo and ex vivo experiments, and in silico multiscale simulation tools to examine the biomechanical basis for the link between myopia and glaucoma. The grant will focus on three primary areas of interest: 1) We will examine the ocular biomechanical changes that occur within the sclera and ONH during high myopia development in tree shrews. 2) We will determine whether scleral remodeling that leads to high myopia predisposes an animal to accelerated pathologic ONH remodeling and increased axon loss in experimental glaucoma. And, 3) We will use multiscale modeling to elucidate the interacting biomechanical mechanisms underlying glaucoma and high myopia. This knowledge will be used to develop novel targets for future glaucoma therapies. Project Narrative Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, yet we are still trying to develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that cause this disease. While we know that increased eye pressure is a risk factor for glaucoma, recent evidence also indicates moderate to high myopia is an independent risk factor.

"Vector Flow Velocity Imaging of Human Placenta using Angle-resolved Ultrasound and Deep Learning This proposal describes a five-year research and career development program to prepare Dr. You Li for a career as an independent investigator. The program will build upon Dr. Li’s multidisciplinary background as a biomedical engineer, trained in medical ultrasound imaging, by providing expertise in obstetrics, the application of machine learning in medical imaging, and translational research. The PI will be mentored at Stanford University by Drs. Jeremy Dahl (primary mentor, medical ultrasound), Virginia Winn (co-mentor, obstetrics and gynecology), and Matthew Lungren (co-mentor, radiology and artificial intelligence). Human placenta plays a vital role in human development, and its abnormalities may cause significant consequences to both the mother and the fetus. Preeclampsia, in particular, is a common disorder that affects approximately 1 in 33 pregnancies in the United States and accounts for 18% of pregnancy-associated maternal death. Many placental abnormalities, including preeclampsia, are related to the hemodynamics and growth of vessels in placenta. Despite the severe consequences of placental abnormalities, our understanding in placenta and placental abnormalities is lacking. One primary reason for the gap of knowledge is the inability to observe the hemodynamics of placenta in vivo. Currently, B-mode and Doppler ultrasound are the primary imaging modalities in imaging the placenta and its vasculature. However, significant limitations exist in the ability of Doppler ultrasound to visualize and measure detailed flow velocities in placental vasculature. It has low sensitivity to small vessels in the placenta, including spiral arteries and chorionic villi, and can only measure flow velocity along the ultrasound beam direction, requiring tedious manual angle correction for flow along any of the visible vessels if quantitative information is desired. These limitations make conventional Doppler ultrasound poorly suited for imaging the hemodynamics of the complex vasculature of human placenta. To provide full and detailed characterization of placental hemodynamics, we propose to develop a vector flow velocity imaging technique using deep neural network models and multiple angle plane wave ultrasound transmits. This technique will be able to quantitatively image both the flow velocity magnitudes and flow directions of millimeter-diameter vessels in human placenta over a large field of view. Aim 1 and 2 will be focused on the technical development of the technique to provide a semi- real-time vector flow imaging system based on a research ultrasound scanner, paving way for Aim 3, which will be focused on validating the clinical value of the technique on a pilot clinical study to image the hemodynamics in spiral arteries and chorionic villi of pregnant women. Successful completion of the project will provide a novel technique for the scientific and early clinical assessment of placental hemodynamics, development, and abnormalities including the development of the villous tree structure, placenta accreta, preeclampsia, and placental insufficiency. During the project, the PI will receive training in machine learning, obstetrics, translational research, and career development skills, which will transition the PI into an independent faculty. Our understanding in human placenta and its abnormalities is limited, because we do not have a medical imaging device to non-invasively observe the blood flow in the small vessels of human placenta in vivo. To fill this gap, we propose to build a semi-real-time ultrasound vector flow velocity imaging system using deep learning models to provide detailed and quantitative imaging of the flow velocity magnitudes and flow directions in human placenta. The successful completion of the project will provide a novel ultrasound imaging technology for the scientific investigation and early clinical assessment of placental development and abnormalities.",Vector Flow Velocity Imaging of Human Placenta using Angle-resolved Ultrasound and Deep Learning,10371743,K99HD105019,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Chorionic villi ', ' Placental Villi ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Faculty ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Gynecology ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' Premature Labor ', ' Premature Obstetric Labor ', ' Preterm Labor ', ' Manuals ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' Noise ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Placenta ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Accreta ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' placental disorders ', ' Placental Insufficiency ', ' Placentation ', ' Placental Development ', ' Play ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Program Development ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Doppler Ultrasound ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Lateral ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Supersonic waves ', ' Ultrasound waves ', ' Ultrasonic wave ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' millimeter ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' fetal ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' technique development ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Spiral Artery of the Endometrium ', ' Spiral Artery ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Villous ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Imaging technology ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Network-based ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' Data Science ', ' human imaging ', ' early pregnancy ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,127673
"Institutional Career Development Core The KL2 Mentored Clinical Scholars Program attracts a diverse group of highly talented junior faculty across multiple disciplines from across Yale University (Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Science) who will pursue careers in T1-T4 translational research. This Program has been extremely successful, attracting 151 Scholars who have authored >5200 publications, have been PIs on 258 NIH grants, and have received a total of $557 million in grant funding. Remarkably, 99% of our KL2 Scholars have attained positions in academia, industry or public health conducting, and often with leadership responsibilities for, clinical and translational research. We aim to build on this success by providing Scholars with individualized, competency-based training in translational research that prepares them to contribute to the learning healthcare system, to advance personalized health, and to address health disparities. This preparation includes training in clinical trials, big data, machine learning, bioinformatics, multidisciplinary translational research, team science, implementation science and community-based participatory research. It also introduces them to regulatory issues, bioethics, Good Clinical Practices, and factors that drive rigor, transparency, and replicability. The KL2 promotes the development of relevant competencies among the Scholars by providing: 1) opportunities to work successfully in complex and diverse multidisciplinary research teams, 2) access to mentorship by senior mentors and recent Clinical Scholars, 3) externships in industry, public health and regulatory agencies, and 4) intensive training in grant-writing and in multidisciplinary team science. To oversee these diverse, highly motivated junior investigators, we have an educational leadership team of: 1) three outstanding investigator mentors who work in different areas of translational research, 2) an experienced Diversity Officer, and 3) an expert in evaluating and dynamically reshaping medical education programs. This leadership team has used feedback from prior Scholars and their mentors to add new initiatives to the already successful program. We expanded our logic model to implement social network analyses to track the activities of the Scholars, and we will expand the curriculum to include a new course. That course will mix Scholars and TL-1 trainees who will work in teams as they get formal training and peer mentoring in a variety of areas such as big data/machine learning, diversity and inclusion, and running a research laboratory. With these additions to an already strong curriculum, we believe that the Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program will be ideally positioned to train the next generation of leaders in T1-T4 translational research who will transform healthcare in ways that alleviate the burden of disease and improve health in the US and around the world. The Specific Aims of the KL2 are: Aim 1: The Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program: To provide a program comprised of a mentored research experience, coursework, and seminars that are intended to promote the emergence of scientific independence and the career development of talented young T1-T4 translational scientist Scholars. Aim 2: The Yale Masters in Health Science Program: To provide those M.D. Scholars who do not possess an advanced research degree with additional coursework and scholarly activities to qualify for a Masters in Health Science (MHS) to address limitations in their scientific preparation for a research career.

"Diversity Supplement to Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark’s population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD and mortality later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis- generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Diversity Supplement to Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term

"A prospective multiethnic HFpEF cohort from California's Central Valley ABSTRACT This is a new U01 application to establish a Clinical Center (CC) for a prospective multiethnic HFpEF cohort from California central valley for deep phenotyping analyses. The investigative team is diverse, multidisciplinary, and complementary with investigators from School of Medicine, College of Engineering and College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. The investigative team is highly collaborative and has strong track records of previous participation in large-scale research networks involving electronic data from heterogeneous sources, including EHRs, mobile health technologies, and direct-to-participant mailings/web portals. UC Davis Heart Failure Network has one of the most diverse patient population in the country, with a large representation of Latino population from California Central Valley. Our network has an extensive catchman area with a momentous growth in patient volume. The proposed deep phenotyping will take advantage of the newly developed total-body PET scan at UC Davis to decipher the roles of organ-specific variations in metabolic syndrome and inflammation in a diverse and heterogenous HFpEF population. One unique feature of the proposed study is the use of functional connectomics analyses to directly exploit the heterogeneity in the HFpEF population. Indeed, it is the heterogeneity that provides the necessary data needed to derive the interconnections to test the critical network drivers, that will provide eventual insights into potential molecular targets for therapy as well as the unbiased classifications of subtypes of HFpEF. Finally, functional connectomics analyses enable modular “plugin” of new datasets (e.g., microbiomes), derived from deep phenotyping analyses from other CCs in the HeartShare Network. Therefore, our proposed study promises to contribute both technically and conceptually to the overall understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogenous disease in HFpEF.

"3D quantification of NASH-related liver fibrosis using open-top light-sheet microscopy Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence is estimated at >25% in the U.S., making it the most common cause of chronic liver disease. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD, affects 1-3% of the U.S. population and is expected to double by 2030. Currently, there is no effective pharmacotherapy for NAFLD, but there are numerous promising drug candidates being evaluated in clinical trials. However, the primary endpoint for these trials, histologic fibrosis, has shortcomings including sampling error and use of a subjective five category scale to quantify a continuous variable. Our team has pioneered the use of 3D open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscopy, which enables rapid, high-throughput imaging of large clinical samples. In combination with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, we hypothesize that 3D OTLS microscopy can provide more accurate and consistent assessment of fibrosis in liver biopsies from NASH patients. We will test this hypothesis by developing a multiplex staining protocol and machine learning analysis pipeline, which will be piloted on 20 archived FFPE liver biopsies. Results from our assay will be correlated with currently used primary and secondary outcome measures to motivate further studies with sing archived samples from clinical trials with responsivity and outcomes data. Narrative Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) affects 1-3% of the U.S. population and is expected to double by 2030. There are many promising therapeutic agents to treat NASH, but the primary outcome, histologic fibrosis assessment, is plagued by sampling error and use of a subjective five category scale to quantify a continuous variable.

"Development of a Precision Medicine-based Diagnostic Tool for Membranous Nephropathy Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop a precision medicine approach to the rapid diagnosis of membranous nephropathy (MN) using automated statistical analysis of proteomic data obtained from kidney biopsies. This approach uses data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) and an algorithmic data pipeline capable of efficiently determining the most likely MN antigen types present in kidney biopsy tissue. MN is a heterogenous autoimmune kidney disease that is caused in most cases by the presence of circulating pathogenic autoantibodies that react with podocyte antigens leading to the formation and accumulation of pathogenic immune complexes around glomerular capillary loops. Using the example of PLA2R-type MN, determination of antigen type has been shown to be important for diagnosis, monitoring response to treatment and early detection of disease flares. Historically, determination of MN antigen type has been performed by immunostaining; however, this has become impractical due to the discovery of at least 17 antigen types. There often is not enough tissue in the biopsy sample to conduct this number of immunostains, and moreover the immunostaining process is both time and resource intensive. The use of DIA-MS provides a novel proteomics approach to antigen typing in which immune complexes are captured by elution from frozen biopsy tissue, digested into tryptic peptides, and then measured by DIA-MS. Candidate MN antigens are identified using algorithmic classification and then validated in a final immunostaining step to confirm the candidate antigen. Our preliminary studies indicate that this is a robust approach; however, the method is not scalable without a similarly robust data analysis pipeline. In this Phase I project, we will optimize the DIA-MS method and then collect quantitative data from known cases of the most common types of MN that can be used to develop, train, test and optimize algorithmic classification models using a machine learning (ML) approach. In order to train the ML models, we will collect DIA-MS protein abundance data from 50 samples each of PLA2R, THSD7A and Exostosin types of MN, as well as 50 samples that are negative for each of these antigens as controls. In the Phase II, we will build complete datasets for all known antigen types of MN and optimize the ML classifier model for diagnostic workflows. Successful completion of these aims will result in the development a comprehensive method to efficiently classify MN cases of any antigen type. These tools will advance the practice of renal pathology from a largely morphology-based approach of diagnosing disease to a precision medicine-based proteomics approach that will efficiently provide actionable information to clinicians caring for patients with MN. PROJECT NARRATIVE Membranous nephropathy is a heterogenous autoimmune kidney disease that is caused in most cases by the presence of circulating pathogenic autoantibodies that react with antigens in podocytes or circulating autoantigens, leading to the formation and accumulation of pathogenic immune complex deposits around glomerular capillary loops. New findings suggest that these pathogenic autoantibodies are formed in each case by an autoimmune response against a single autoantigen, and that the titer of autoantibodies can serve as a useful biomarker for activity of disease that can in turn be used to monitor disease status and guide therapy. In this Phase I application, we will develop analytical methods using Data Independent Mass Spectrometry (DIA- MS) and machine learning that will ultimately enable efficient identification of autoantigen types in kidney biopsies from patients with membranous nephropathy of any type.",Development of a Precision Medicine-based Diagnostic Tool for Membranous Nephropathy,10324016,R41DK130702,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigen-Antibody Complex ', ' Immune Complex ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Archives ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' autoreactive antibody ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' Autoantigens ', ' Autologous Antigens ', ' Self-Antigens ', ' Autoimmune Responses ', ' Biopsy ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Explosion ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Membranous Glomerulonephritis ', ' Extramembranous Glomerulopathy ', ' Membranous Glomerulonephropathy ', ' Membranous Glomerulopathy ', ' Membranous Nephropathy ', ' Goals ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' IgG ', ' Immunoassay ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Lupus Nephritis ', ' Lupus Glomerulonephritis ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephritis ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Publishing ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Extracts ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' G-substrate ', ' cerebellum protein substrate for cGMP dependent protein kinase ', ' protein G ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Pythons ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Glomerular Capillary ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Morphology ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Techniques ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Visceral Epithelial Cell ', ' glomerular visceral epithelial cell ', ' podocyte ', ' Incubated ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Flare ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data acquisition ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' classification algorithm ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal biopsy ', ' data pipeline ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' learning classifier ', ' feature selection ', ' Autoimmune ', ' pathogenic autoantibodies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEPHROPATHOLOGY ASSOCIATES,R41,2021,231568
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. Biomarkers will also be tested for causality the mouse model. The Administrative Core will perform the outward- facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Global Health Catalyst (GHC) Summit Project Summary Recently, leaders in cancer policy from the USA and 14 economically diverse countries concluded that successful campaigns to control cancer will increasingly depend on concerted international collaborations. The recent World Health Organization Cancer Report highlights urgency for such international collaborations, with over 60% of 14 million new cancer cases and 70% of 8.2 million deaths per year occurring in low and middle income countries (LMIC), some of which, sadly, are the least capable of dealing with cancer without some form of collaboration. These major disparities in cancer deaths are in part a reflection of poignant underlying disparities in Radiation Oncology. For example, radiotherapy, which is needed in the treatment of over 50% of cancer patients, is not available in about half of Africa's 54 countries, and preliminary research shows major safety concerns in implementation of radiotherapy where available. The overall goal of this proposal is to organize yearly global health catalyst (GHC) cancer summits designed to catalyze high impact international collaborations between US and African Institutions to address the growing global burden of cancers, and associated disparities. This GHC summits, will build on the success and lessons learned over the past years during previously organized summits, that have catalyzed collaborations to support cancer healthcare institutions in different African countries, supported education and training efforts to build human/research capacity, and established fecund research collaborations, along with disease prevention and advocacy programs in global oncology. An innovative component of the summit is the focus on outreach engagement of under-represented minorities and the resource-laden Africans in Diaspora (AiD) to turn the devastating effects of brain drain to gain against cancer. Outcomes will include: new and strengthened collaborations involving partners from both USA and African institutions each year, significant increase in participation of under-represented minorities and diaspora in global oncology, peer-reviewed publications co-authored by both USA and African collaborators, joint patents resulting from research collaborations, and continuous growth to engage more participation from USA and African Institutions to address the growing global burden of cancer and associated disparities. Project Narrative The overall goal of this project is to organize Global Health Catalyst cancer summits which will catalyze sustainable high impact USA-Africa collaborations designed to significantly enhance cancer research and education benefiting both USA and African countries.

"Sensitive and Quantitative MS-bases Glycomic Mapping Platform Glycosylation is one of the most complex protein modifications; more than 50% of mammalian proteins are glycosylated. The fact that there are 100,000 proteoforms coded by only ~20,300 genes identified in the human genome emphasizes the importance of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) like glycosylation. Aberrant protein glycosylation has been implicated in many diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, congenital/metabolic disorders, diabetes, inflammation, Parkinson’s disease, bacterial/viral infectious diseases, and various cancers. More recently, glycans have been associated with coronavirus spike glycoproteins, including the SARS- CoV-2 virion. The diverse biological roles of glycans and their implications in diseases have created a demand for reliable qualitative and quantitative glycomic approaches, which facilitates sensitive investigation of glycan changes in different biological and biomedical samples. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the most efficient technique in glycomics due to its high sensitivity and capacity for acquiring structural information. However, glycomic research remains a challenge because of the microheterogeneity of glycan compositions in complex biological samples; the relatively low abundance in nature and low ionization efficiency in MS analysis; and the existence of variant positional and linkage isomers caused by the biosynthesis process. To overcome these challenges, several separation methods have been coupled to MS. Despite the development of these separation techniques, isomeric separation of glycans remains insufficient. There is an increasing demand for more efficient isomeric separation approaches since glycan isomers have been related to different diseases.  The main aim of this proposal is to provide easily accessible, adaptable, and affordable strategies for better separation and characterization of glycans and glycan isomers derived from different glycoconjugates. Aim 1 is focused on finding a replacement for porous craphitic carbon columns that sufferes from low reprodcubility and loss of resolution and efficiency with time. The in-house mesoporous graphitic carbon (MGC)-LC-MS will be investigated for both permethylated (Aim 1a) and native (Aim 2b) isomeric separation of N- and O-glycans, glycolipid glycans, and free oligosaccharides. Other alternatives (also part of Aim 1a), such as 50 cm and 200 cm micro pillar array columns (μPAC)-C18-LC-MS, and a 50 cm long capillary nanoC18-LC-MS, will also be evaluated to achieve an improved isomeric separation of glycan isomers. Subsequently, GUI will be utilized to improve the identification of glycan isomers. A GUI libraries for the separation strategies developed in Aim 1 will be established to normalize the possible retention time shift among different runs (Aim 2). LC-M based glycomics quantitative strategies will be developed and assessed in Aim 3. The combination of permethylation and TMT will capitalize on the advantages of both techniques, providing enhanced sensitivity and accuracy in glycan quantitation (Aim 3a). Additionally, the combination of 8-plex isotopic permethylation and 6-plex TMT will facilitate a reliable 48-plex, thus significantly increasing the throughput of analysis (Aim 3b). Furthermore, with the improved separation and identification (Aim 1 and 2), PRM will be employed to assist the better quantitation of glycans and the differentiation of glycan isomers. A library containing the fragments fingerprint of each glycan isomer will be created to aid the glycan isomeric identification (Aim 3c). The development of automated software for easy, fast, and accurate glycomic data processing is the main focus of Aim 4. Finally, the aforementioned strategies and tools will be applied to clinical samples to address a variety of biological and biomedical issues such as COVID-19, breast cancer brain metastasis, liver cancer vs. cirrhosis, kidney diseases, algae development, and others (Aim 5). The development of the proposed methods and algorithms will help us and our collaborators to better understand the attributes and biomedical significance of glycan isomers in the development and progression of esophageal, breast, and liver cancer. Furthermore, we expect the analytical tools and algorithms proposed here to benefit researchers and scientists who are interested in understanding the biological attributes of glycan isomers in other systems. The proposed research will enable the development of tools for the characterization of protein carbohydrate structures at a sensitivity, throughput, and level of detail not previously possible. The implementation of these tools will enable researchers to better understand the attributes and biomedical significance of glycans in the development and progression of a wide array of diseases. Examples of future benefits for public health include the identification of disease and cancer biomarkers for medical diagnostics and the monitoring of recombinant protein therapeutics, which will lead to better targeted drugs that are more bioactive with fewer side effects.",Sensitive and Quantitative MS-bases Glycomic Mapping Platform,10318016,R01GM112490,"['Adhesions ', ' Algae ', '

"Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens Project Summary  Characterizing the functions of protein-coding genes is an important goal in the post-genomic era. While proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions, including those mis-regulated in disease, we have an extremely limited understanding of the roles of the majority of proteins in the human proteome. Though powerful, existing technologies for the high-throughput interrogation of protein-coding genes, including CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches and RNA interference, require extended periods of time to effect changes in protein levels, and thus suffer two critical shortcomings. First, they are unable to detect the contribution of growth- essential genes to any cellular process other than viability, as any cell carrying a perturbation in such a gene would fail to propagate. Second, compensatory and adaptive effects have ample opportunity to manifest, thus convoluting screen results by ameliorating the effect of the perturbation, or by generating a novel, unrelated effect. To address these critical limitations, I propose to develop a new screening technology that will minimize the time between perturbation and screen readout by inducibly and rapidly degrading endogenous proteins. This is made possible by a readily scalable endogenous tagging technology that harnesses homology-independent targeted integration to insert a synthetic exon into the intron of a protein-coding gene at the site of a double strand break. The synthetic exon will encode a multifunctional ligand-binding protein that depending on the ligand, will lead to fluorescence or rapid degradation. Pooled libraries of sgRNAs targeting different introns allows for the creation of custom libraries of cells, where each cell carries this multifunctional tag on a different protein. The utility of this approach will be established aims 1 and 2 by testing (1) whether cells that have undergone rapid depletion of growth-essential proteins are maintained in the cell library at the end of the short perturbation window and (2) whether rapid depletion and CRISPR knockout at the same protein produce different effects on a well-established phenotype, due to the distorting effects of adaptation events in the knockout. Aim 3 witnesses the use of a machine learning approach and the data from thousands of attempted tagging events to identify how the features of a potential tag site dictate the likelihood that a functional protein carrying the multifunctional tag will be produced. The resulting model will be unleashed on the protein-coding genome to predict high-quality tag sites for as many protein-coding genes as possible. This will establish an improved screening paradigm that will allow for the pooled interrogation of the contributions of thousands of proteins to a phenotype of interest, will thus accelerate the rate at which we come to understand the poorly understood elements of the protein-coding genome. These efforts will be well supported by the outstanding resources for experimentation and mentorship at both the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and will provide excellent training in experimental techniques for protein perturbation and characterization, as well computational literacy in the broadly useful field of machine learning. Project Narrative  Proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions in health and disease. Yet, the functions of the majority proteins encoded by the human genome are very poorly understood. A novel high-throughput screening strategy leveraging rapid protein degradation will dramatically accelerate functional characterization of the human proteome.",Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens,10268980,F31HG011185,"['Cell division ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Inclusion Bodies ', ' Cellular Inclusions ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Dropout ', ' Elements ', ' Exons ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' literacy ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motivation ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting ', ' Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting Fractionation ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sortings ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Measurement ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Shunt ', ' shunts ', ' Shunt Device ', ' interest ', ' mutant ', ' Metabolic Protein Degradation ', ' Protein Turnover ', ' Regulatory Protein Degradation ', ' protein degradation ', ' knockout gene ', ' Essential Genes ', ' novel ', ' Proteome ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' high throughput technology ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Genomics ', ' Drops ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Screening Result ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' blind ', ' Coupling ', ' DNA lesion ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' screening ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,33463
"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10268976,K99MD014738,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aldosterone Antagonists ', ' aldosterone inhibitor ', ' Angiotensin II ', ' AngII ', ' Animals ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Arteriovenous fistula ', ' AV fistula ', ' Arteriovenous Aneurysm ', ' Attention ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Calcium Channel ', ' Calcium Channel Antagonist Receptor ', ' Calcium Channel Blocker Receptors ', ' Calcium Ion Channels ', ' VDCC ', ' Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channels ', ' Cardiac Output ', ' heart output ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Denervation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Diuretics ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A ', ' Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme ', ' CD143 Antigens ', ' Carboxycathepsin ', ' Dipeptidyl Peptidase A ', ' Kininase A ', ' Kininase II ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity -

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and affect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable of discovering local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest. The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image datasets is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy.

"Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Successful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified many disease-susceptibility genes. Through great efforts from international GWAS consortium and large-scale collaborative projects, massive datasets including high-quality GWAS data and well-characterized clinical phenotypes are now available in public repositories such as dbGaP and UK Biobank. Clinically, color fundus images have been extensively used by ophthalmologists to diagnose AMD and its severity level. The combination of wealthy GWAS data and fundus image data provides an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to test new hypotheses that are beyond the objectives of original projects. Among them, predictive models for AMD development and its progression based on both GWAS and fundus image data have not been explored. Most existing prediction models only focus on classic statistical approaches, often regression models with a limited number of predictors (e.g., SNPs). Moreover, most predictions only give static risks rather than dynamic risk trajectories over time, of which the latter is more informative for a progressive disease like AMD. Recent advances of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy by incorporating multiple layers of hidden non-linear effects when large-scale training datasets with well-defined phenotypes are available. Despite its success in many areas, deep learning has not been fully explored in AMD and other eye diseases. Motivated by multiple large-scale studies of AMD development or progression, where GWAS and/or longitudinal fundus image data have been collected, we propose novel deep learning methods for predicting AMD status and its progression, and to identify subgroups with significant different risk profiles. Specially, in Aim 1, we will construct a novel local convolutional neural network to predict disease occurrence (AMD or not) and severity (e.g., mild AMD, intermediate AMD, late AMD) based on (1a): a large cohort of 35,000+ individuals with GWAS data and (1b): a smaller cohort of 4,000+ individuals with both GWAS and fundus image data. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel deep neural network survival model for predicting individual disease progression trajectory (e.g., time to late-AMD). In both aims, we will use the local linear approximation technique to identify important predictors that contribute to individual risk profile prediction and to identify subgroups with different risk profiles. In Aim 3, we will validate and calibrate our methods using independent cohorts and implement proposed methods into user-friendly software and easy-to-access web interface. With the very recent FDA approval for Beovu, a novel injection treatment for wet AMD (one type of late AMD) by inhibiting VEGF and thus suppressing the growth of abnormal blood vessels, it makes our study more significant, as it will provide most cutting-edge and comprehensive prediction models for AMD which have great potential to facilitate early diagnosis and tailored treatment and clinical management of the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new analytic methods and software tools to facilitate novel prediction of AMD development and its progression. The successful completion of the project will generate the first comprehensive set of deep-learning-based prediction models and web-based interfaces, which jointly analyzes large-scale GWAS and fundus image data and has the great potential to enhance the early diagnosis and current clinical management of AMD.

"Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms Project Summary:  Multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibits a markedly heterogeneous and unpredictable course, with a clinical spectrum ranging from very mild forms of the disease in some patients (often termed “benign MS”) to an aggressive disease course with rapid accumulation of disability in others. Furthermore, there appears to be significant inter-individual variability in the responses to the many available disease-modifying therapies (DMT). A variety of factors have been proposed to be associated with the disease course in MS, including demographics, lifestyle factors, clinical characteristics, MRI-derived measures, and elevated serum neurofilament light chain (NfL), among others. It remains unclear though if these factors are complementary or redundant in their predictive value. Moreover, there is a lack of validated tools to accurately predict, at an individual level, future inflammatory disease activity or disability worsening. This is largely due to the lack of datasets with sufficient size, breadth and representativeness. The use of electronic medical records (EMR) has dramatically increased in recent years, enabling the capture of a wide variety of data measures from large numbers of individuals. Furthermore, the development and refinement of statistical machine learning methods has revolutionized the approach to analysis of such high-dimensional datasets. This background provides a unique opportunity to leverage and analyze “big data” in order to develop clinical risk prediction algorithms and personalized medicine tools in MS.  Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions (MS PATHS) is a network of 10 MS centers that have standardized elements of their clinical practice to implement a centralized health information exchange architecture. MS PATHS was designed around the concept of a learning health system (LHS), merging research with ongoing patient care by collecting standardized clinical and imaging data during routine medical visits. As of August, 2019, >15,000 patients have opted to participate in MS PATHS. Thus, the MS PATHS network is an ideal, deeply phenotyped, “real-world”, large population of people with MS, in which clinically relevant predictive algorithms may be developed and validated.  The goal of the current project is to develop and validate multi-modal predictive algorithms of clinically relevant disease outcomes in MS. We hypothesize that integrating a wide variety of potential predictors, including demographics, clinical characteristics (including current/historical DMT use), comorbidities/lifestyle factors, MRI- derived measures and laboratory data (including serum NfL) will lead to the development and validation of algorithms that may accurately predict future clinical disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity. Furthermore, this approach will allow the assessment of the individual contribution of specific predictors to the developed predictive algorithms, and may aid with the identification of novel risk factors of disease severity in MS. Project Narrative Successful completion of this project will lead to the development and dissemination of clinically relevant predictive algorithms to enable personalized risk assessment and therapeutic decision-making in MS, provide the means to optimize selection/stratification of participants in clinical trials, and will also provide insight regarding the interactions and relative importance of putative prognostic factors in MS.",Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms,10224357,K23NS117883,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Exhibits ', ' foot ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' neurofilament ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Visit ', ' processing speed ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' Contrast-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gadolinium-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gd-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Enhancing Lesion ', ' Health system ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Stratification ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' demographics ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' clinical risk ', ' dexterity ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' clinical predictors ', ' walking speed ', ' walking pace ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' inter-individual variability ', ' interindividual variability ', ' interindividual variation ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' high dimensionality ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' disability risk ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,170094
"Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development The need for improved and more universally protective influenza vaccines is well recognized. Central to efforts towards improvements is the development of animal models more predictive of the human response to immunization and/or infection. Indeed, this need has been highlighted by the NIAID Strategic Plan for a Universal Influenza Vaccine. While animal models may never be able to fully predict the human response, understanding their full strengths and weaknesses and identifying the optimal models for different purposes is a significant public health need and is the scientific premise behind our proposed objectives. These objectives, which are built upon our extensive use of influenza animal models, are to optimize animal modeling of immunologic imprinting, to improve vaccine efficacy testing, and to identify immune correlates of protection and boosting immune responses. Our overall goal is to provide superior preclinical models to support universal influenza vaccine development. We will achieve this goal through three complementary and interrelated specific aims, 1) optimal modeling of human serologic responses to repeat influenza antigen exposure in animal models; 2) improving the quantitative nature of the ferret influenza challenge model; and 3) defining serologic correlates of influenza virus induced clinical symptoms. Our ability to conduct these aims is supported through our participation in, and collaboration with, a recently NIAID-funded human infant cohort, the DIVINCI study. We will mirror the influenza antigen exposures of a selection of these infants in three animal models and compare immunologic data sets to identify which most accurately reflects the human response (Aim 1). This marriage of human and animal data sets and samples offers an innovative way forward and will provide a unique set of differentially primed animals with which to determine immune correlates of novel physiologic parameters of infection and immune responses (Aim 2) using original machine learning algorithms (Aim 3). Current models for influenza vaccine development suffer from poor predictability of the human response. Through an innovative combination of approaches that use data from longitudinal human cohorts, we intend to greatly enhance the reliability and value of these models in universal influenza vaccine testing.",Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development,10224652,R01AI150745,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-virals ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Ferrets ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hamsters ', ' Cricetinae ', ' Hamsters Mammals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' flu vaccine ', ' flu virus vaccine ', ' vaccine against flu ', ' vaccine against influenza ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Marriage ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Whole Body Plethysmography ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Public Health ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Seasons ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Telemetry ', ' Telemetries ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virulence ', ' Virus Replication ', ' viral multiplication ', ' viral replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' Measures ', ' Cavia ', ' Guinea Pigs ', ' Guinea Pigs Mammals ', ' Lasso ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Natural History ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Serology ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Immunological Models ', ' Immunologic Model ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' Upper respiratory tract ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' vaccine development ', ' animal data ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' evaluate vaccines ', ' vaccine screening ', ' vaccine testing ', ' vaccine evaluation ', ' Influenza Virus ', ' influenzavirus ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Vaccine Production ', ' produce vaccines ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype ', ' H3N2 ', ' H3N2 Virus ', ' safety study ', ' Output ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' vaccine effectiveness ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' imprint ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' mouse development ', ' preclinical evaluation ', ' pre-clinical evaluation ', ' product development ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' efficacy testing ', ' animal model development ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' universal influenza vaccine ', ' universal flu vaccine ', ' universal influenza virus vaccine ', ' universal vaccine against flu ', ' universal vaccine against influenza ', ' universal vaccine ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIAID,ST.

"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression. Developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. The proposed work will identify disease phenotypes in knee OA that will allow for the assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effect in clinical trials and ultimately lead to the development of

"Cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by heterochronic blood exchange PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  Aging-induced cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction is the primary factor in impairment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) responses and dysregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), contributing to the genesis of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) in mice as well as bioassay experiments in cultured endothelial cells treated with sera from human patients, non-human primates and rodent models of aging provide compelling evidence that implicates non-cell autonomous mechanisms as key drivers of endothelial aging processes. Guided by analysis of vascular transcriptomic changes in heterochronic parabiont mice the objective of the proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation activated by specific circulating anti-geronic factors present in young blood. The central hypothesis is that young blood rescues the age-related decline in signaling via the NAD+/SIRT1 axis and reverses circulating IGF-1 deficiency, each of which can result in vascular mitochondrial rejuvenation, attenuation of endothelial oxidative stress, improved endothelial vasodilator function and restoration of endothelial angiogenic processes. The resulting increases in CBF and NVC responses reduce ischemic loci, promoting brain health. The following aims are proposed: 1) Determine the role of the cerebromicrovascular NAD+ /SIRT1 axis in rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE rescues the age-related decline in NAD+, which rejuvenates cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells via a SIRT1-dependent pathway. It is predicted that disruption of the NAD+ /SIRT1 axis will prevent cerebrovascular rejuvenation by HBE in aged mice. 2) Determine the role of circulating IGF-1 in cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE reverses age-related IGF-1 deficiency, which exerts multifaceted endothelial protective effects contributing to cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by young blood. It is predicted that HBE-mediated endothelial functional and transcriptomic changes are partially prevented by disruption of IGF-1/IGFR1 signaling. 3) Determine how circulating NAD precursors and IGF-1 in young and old humans determine cerebromicrovascular endothelial function and phenotype. This will be tested by bioassaying the effects of circulating factors and integrating the results with existing endothelial function, NVC and CBF data from the serum donors. To optimize cognitive status prediction with automated machine learning we will perform association analyses of endothelial signatures with cerebrovascular and cognitive measures using linear mixed effect models. Together, the proposed studies will elucidate the involvement of two key mechanisms in the protective effects of HBE against cerebromicrovascular aging and the pathogenesis of VCID. NARRATIVE The human brain is supplied by a dense array of vessels where each neuron has its supplying capillary. Aging impairs functionally and structurally the cerebromicrovasculature and thus induces consequential neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Our recent studies using heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) in mice showed that young blood rescues the age-related decline in signaling via the NAD+/SIRT1 axis and reverses circulating IGF-1 deficiency, each of which can result in vascular mitochondrial rejuvenation, attenuation of endothelial oxidative stress, improved endothelial vasodilator function and restoration of endothelial angiogenic processes, improving brain health.",Cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by heterochronic blood exchange,10208361,RF1AG072295,"['Abbreviations ', ' Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' brain blood flow ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Endothelium ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperemia ', ' Insulin-Like Growth Factor I ', ' IGF-1 ', ' IGF-I ', ' IGF-I-SmC ', ' Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 ', ' Insulin-Like Somatomedin Peptide I ', ' Somatomedin C ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Parabiosis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Rejuvenation ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Vasodilation ', ' Vasodilatation ', ' Vasorelaxation ', ' Vasodilator Agents ', ' Vasodilating Agent ', ' Vasodilator Drugs ', ' Vasodilators ', ' Work ', ' nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase ', ' NMN pyrophosphorylase ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' base ', ' density ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Series ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Attenuated ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' restoration ', ' extracellular ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' old age ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' attenuation ', ' Structure ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Consequentialism ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' aged ', ' protective effect ', ' Impairment ', ' transcriptomics ', ' healthy aging ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' neurovascular coupling ', ' neuro-vascular coupling ', ' neurovascular ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' brain health ', ' SIRT1 gene ', ' SIRT1 ', ' Sirtuin 1 ', ' vascular cognitive impairment and dementia ', ' cardiac disease induced cognitive impairment ', ' vascular contributions to cognition/dementia ', ' vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' cost estimate ', ' cost estimation ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,RF1,2021,1361358
"Systems Metabolomics for Biomarker Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolomics offers a comprehensive analysis of thousands of small molecules in biological samples. It can play an indispensable role in the growing systems biology approaches to unravel the relationships between metabolites and diseases. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been used for high-throughput analysis of thousands of metabolites. However, the potential values of many disease-associated metabolites discovered by using these platforms have been inadequately explored in systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery due to lack of computational tools and resources to: (1) accurately determine the identity of most of the metabolites; (2) investigate the rewiring interactions among the metabolites due to diseases; and (3) integrate metabolite profiles with those from other omics studies to evaluate the relationships between the metabolites and the diseases at the systems level. Partly due to these limitations, poor generalizability of previously identified metabolite biomarker candidates has been observed, especially when they are evaluated through independent platforms and validation sets. Therefore, new methods are sought to find more generalizable metabolite biomarker candidates. The goal of this research program is to fill the gaps in metabolite identification and multi- omics integration by using systems metabolomics approaches that will enhance the role of metabolomics in systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery. Specifically, the proposed research program will utilize multiple resources (biological databases, spectral libraries, etc.) and innovative statistical, machine learning, and network-based methods for: (1) developing a comprehensive workflow for ranking putative metabolite IDs; (2) differential analysis of metabolite profiles based on changes in the levels of individual metabolites and pairwise interactions in disease vs. control groups; and (3) integration of metabolomics data with genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and glycoproteomics data to identify highly promising metabolite biomarker candidates. Our recent progress has led to acquisition of multi-omics data and development of computational tools for metabolite identification and integrative analysis. The performance of the proposed metabolite identification workflow in ranking putative metabolite IDs will be evaluated through experimental methods using reference compounds. The differential and integrative analysis methods will be used for selection of candidate biomarkers via multi-omics data acquired in biomarker discovery studies. The selected candidates will be evaluated by targeted quantitation using independent samples and platforms compared to those used for discovery. The outcomes of these experimental evaluations will be used not only to help refine the computational methods but also to identify promising biomarker candidates. In summary, the proposed research program seeks to capitalize on the power of network modeling, machine learning, and multi-omics data integration to improve the ability to find disease biomarkers that are likely to succeed in future large-scale biomarker validation studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this research program is to develop computational methods that enhance the role of metabolomics in systems biology approaches for biomarker discovery. Specifically, statistical, network-based, and machine learning methods will be developed for ranking putative metabolite IDs and selection of metabolite biomarker candidates. The performance of the proposed methods for metabolite identification and biomarker selection will be evaluated through experimental methods including: (1) comparing the fragmentation patterns of unknown analytes against those from reference compounds; and (2) targeted quantitative analysis of selected metabolites. 2",Systems Metabolomics for Biomarker Discovery,10206465,R35GM141944,"['Gas Chromatography ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Liquid Chromatography ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' validation studies ', ' Sampling ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' Biological databases ', ' platform-independent ', ' Network-based ', ' network models ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' candidate selection ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' biomarker selection ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' glycoproteomics ', ' biomarker validation ', ' marker validation ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,390000
"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research.

"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,10194566,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Attention ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Computers ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Hand ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Intubation ', ' Intratracheal Intubation ', ' Endotracheal Intubation ', ' tracheal intubation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Manikins ', ' Mannequins ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Neonatology ', ' Patients ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tongue ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Laryngoscopes ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' instructor ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Modality ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Effectiveness ', ' distraction ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' neonate ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' haptics ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Augmented Reality ', ' training opportunity ', ' Visualization ', ' virtual reality simulator ', ' virtual simulator ', ' ventilation ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,314927
"Investigation of arterial changes in the Circle of Willis during intracranial aneurysm growth in humans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prevalence of saccular intracranial aneurysms (IA) in western populations is estimated at around ~3%. Clinically, IA present a dilemma, in that they are usually asymptomatic; however, IA are extremely dangerous if they rupture, causing subarachnoid hemorrhage (~50% mortality). There is convincing evidence that continued IA growth increases the risk of rupture (12-24 times). To better monitor and predict IA progression, there is a compelling need to better understand clinical IA growth (aneurysmal remodeling). 90% of IA occur within the arteries of the Circle of Willis (CoW). Despite there being overwhelming evidence connecting CoW vascular remodeling and IA disease, the majority of IA research focuses only on the IA site, and does not consider the contribution of connected arteries. Specific vascular remodeling in the CoW arteries may provide an additional indicator for monitoring IA progression. The biochemical processes that occur at the IA site include inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling leading to cell death and vessel wall degeneration. Analyses in animal models have strongly connected arterial wall shear stress (WSS) as a trigger of these processes, leading to IA initiation and remodeling. Patient-oriented research has further linked areas of low WSS with IA growth. Because CoW vasculature can change during IA growth, the blood flow entering IA changes and may create a new level of WSS to stabilize the remodeling process. Better understanding how human IA may naturally stabilize is highly relevant to predicting IA progression, and the role of changing WSS will be investigated in this grant. In our recent study of 520 clinically monitored IA, we found that while many IA grew consistently, following a projected growth path, others became stable. We also found that IA growth speed is significantly faster in women. Given the association of IA with sex, family history, and disease, different patterns of vascular remodeling may occur within groups with different genetics or medical history. We propose a clinical translational study to study IA growth in different genetic and medical history groups. We hypothesize IA growth may associate with patterns of vascular remodeling within the CoW. We will test our hypothesis with the following specific aims: (1) Is IA growth a local phenomenon or it associated with vascular remodeling within the CoW? (2) Do genetically similar individuals undergo similar patterns of vascular remodeling? (3) Does blood flow within the CoW associate with vascular remodeling? By identifying how IA disease progression may associate with other remodeling within the CoW, this study can identify new imaging biomarkers that enable improved IA treatment decisions. This proposal is significant because there is an unmet need to accurately assess IA disease progression and changes in risk. This proposal is innovative because it will extend existing IA studies to include more, relevant cerebrovascular arteries and longitudinal data, while implementing several technical innovations specific to this problem which can translate to clinical tracking of cerebrovascular changes PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms are extremely dangerous when they rupture. When one is detected, it may be treated or monitored through imaging, with aneurysm growth a strong indication of increased risk of rupture. This project will study how remodeling in the arteries of the Circle of Willis associates with aneurysm growth, and how blood flow may determine locations of remodeling, in order to identify new biomarkers to improve tracking and assessment of aneurysm progression.",Investigation of arterial changes in the Circle of Willis during intracranial aneurysm growth in humans,10175024,R01HL152270,"['Affect ', ' Aneurysm ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Arteries ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Intracranial Aneurysm ', ' Circle of Willis ', ' Cerebral Arterial Circle ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Inflammation ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney ', ' ADPKD ', ' Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease ', ' Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ', ' Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Blood flow ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' shear stress ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Length ', ' Biochemical Process ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' shape analysis ', ' shape description ', ' Rupture ', ' Outcome ', ' Vascular remodeling ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' translational study ', ' demographics ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical risk ', ' Geometry ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' side effect ', ' arterial tortuosity ', ' artery tortuosity ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,645367
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988.

"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic

"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening.

"Developing computational algorithms for histopathological image analysis Project Summary  Histopathology is the cornerstone of disease diagnosis and prognosis. With the advance of imaging technology, whole-slide image (WSI) scanning of tissue slides is becoming a routine clinical procedure and producing a massive amount of data that captures histopathological details in high resolution. Most current pathological image analysis methods, similar to general image analysis approaches, mainly focus on morphology features, such as tissue texture and granularity, but ignore the complex hierarchical structures of tissues. Cells are the fundamental building blocks to tissues. Different types of cells are first organized into cellular components, which together with the extracellular matrix, form different types of tissue architectures. Understanding the interactions among these different types of cells can provide critical insights into biology and disease status. However, there are some major computational challenges: (1) How to identify and classify different types of cells in tissue, (2) how to characterize the highly complex and heterogeneous spatial organization of tissue, and (3) how to integrate histopathology data with other types of data to study disease status and progression. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel computational methods to analyze histopathology image data to study disease status and progression. In order to achieve this goal, we have built a strong research team with complementary expertise in image analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and clinical pathology. Specifically, we will develop novel algorithms to: (1) classify different types of cells from histopathology tissue WSI scans, (2) characterize and quantify cell spatial distribution and cell-cell interactions, and (3) integrate histopathology data with other types data to study disease progression. All proposed methods were motivated by real-world biological and clinical applications across different types of diseases, such as liver diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. If implemented successfully, the proposed study will facilitate the analysis and modeling of data generated from histopathology tissue slides to improve disease risk assessment, diagnosis, and outcome prediction.

"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,10093035,R01EB016695,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Diffusion ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Head ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Formulations ', ' Relaxation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Anisotropy ', ' Echo-Planar Imaging ', ' Echo-Planar Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Echoplanar Imaging ', ' Echoplanar Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Planar Medical Imaging ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Fiber ', ' Measurement ', ' Homebound Persons ', ' Home-Bound Persons ', ' House-Bound Persons ', ' Shut-In ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' magnetic field ', ' Performance ', ' phase change ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' response ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Slice ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' time use ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' motion sensitivity ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' ']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,558172
"Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations Project Summary/Abstract Significant health disparities exist in chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in ethnically diverse populations. African Americans (AAs) have ~25% higher prevalence of CKD, 3-fold higher rate of ESRD, and the highest risk of mortality among those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45-95mL/min/1.73m2. The most significant traditional risk factors for CKD and ESRD are diabetes and hypertension accounting for >60% CKD and >70% of new ESRD cases, respectively. Non- traditional risk factors for CKD such as environmental, cultural-behavioral factors, geographic, education, insurance coverage, socioeconomic status and unequal access to optimal healthcare, disproportionately affect CKD health in ethnic minorities. The unique combination of these factors on CKD progression in the real world remains poorly defined. Identification of modifiable risk factors that may reduce CKD disparities would be invaluable to improve quality of life, life expectancy, and decrease economic burden. Simulation models have been successfully applied in other clinical domains, but are limited in CKD development and CKD progression, due to small datasets and the absence of modeling techniques using longitudinal observational health data. Further, no models have been tested in a real-world minority population to uncover the potential for interventional studies that would reduce CKD disparities on a larger scale. To our knowledge, we have created the largest, comprehensive database from electronic health records of >10 million individuals seen between 2006-2016 from a 2-year partnership between UCLA (1.8 million) and Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH; 9.2 million) systems. From the UCLA Registry population, we identified significant differences in eGFR trajectory decline between AAs and non-AAs according to baseline eGFR, indicating a pattern shift from a higher to a lower, steeper eGFR trajectory suggesting there may be critical windows for interventions to reduce CKD disparities in AAs. Race/ethnicity differences from linear mixed models of all ethnic cohorts persisted even after controlling for demographic and clinical variables known to influence eGFR trajectories. We hypothesize that the use of ethnically diverse populations in the joint UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry can identify a novel combination of CKD risk factors; and improve the performance of existing simulation models to predict CKD progression. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a machine learning-based simulation model for CKD and eGFR trajectories using the UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry; and conduct internal validation of the models and comparisons with existing CKD risk models, 2) stratify and test simulation models based on different racial/ethnic groups, including external validation based on cross-institution comparisons, and 3) conduct focus groups with UCLA primary care physicians, who manage racial/ethnic patients, to elicit their perspectives on existing and designed simulation models to reduce CKD health disparities. These innovative approaches will facilitate our long-term goal to inform clinical decision support methods to reduce/eliminate CKD health disparities. Project Narrative Disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affect the development of CKD and CKD progression in ethnic minorities. The ability to use large datasets of patient information to reduce these disparities is greatly lacking. We will conduct simulation modeling to identify a unique set of risk factors that predict CKD and CKD progression, that can be targeted for individualized treatment in patients with highest risk of kidney function decline, with valuable input on the potential utility of this resource from focus groups consisting of primary care physicians.",Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation

"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways.

"Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy Abstract: This project aims to establish differential artery-vein analysis in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and to validate comprehensive OCTA features for automated classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Early detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of treatment outcomes are essential to prevent irreversible visual loss from DR. It is known that DR can target arteries and veins differently. Therefore, differential artery-vein analysis can provide better performance of DR detection and classification. However, clinical OCTA instruments lack the capability of artery-vein differentiation. During this project, we propose to use quantitative feature analysis of OCT, which is concurrently captured with OCTA, to guide artery- vein differentiation in OCTA. The first aim is to establish automated artery-vein differentiation in OCTA. In coordination with our recently demonstrated blood vessel tracking technique, OCT intensity/geometry features will be used to guide artery-vein differentiation in OCTA automatically. Differential artery-vein analysis of blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vessel caliber (BVC), blood vessel density (BVD), vessel perimeter index (VPI), vessel branching coefficient (VBC), vessel branching angle (VBA), branching width ratio (BWR), fovea avascular zone area (FAZ-A) and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) will be implemented. Key success criterion of the aim 1 study is to demonstrate robust artery-vein differentiation in OCTA, and to establish OCTA features for objective detection and classification of DR. The second aim is to validate automated OCTA classification of DR. We propose to employ ensemble machine learning to integrate multiple classifiers to achieve robust OCTA classification of DR. Key success criterion of the aim 2 study is to identify OCTA features and optimal-feature- combination to detect early DR, and to establish the correlations between the OCTA features and clinical biomarkers. The third aim is to verify OCTA prediction and evaluation of DR treatment. Our preliminary OCTA study of diabetic macular edema (DME) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment has shown that BVD can serve as a biomarker predictive of visual improvement. During this project, we plan to test differential artery-vein analysis for DME treatment evaluation. Key success criterion of the aim 3 study is to identify artery-vein features to provide robust prediction and evaluation of DME treatment outcomes. As an alternative approach, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for deep machine leaning based artery-vein and DR classification. Early layers in the FCNN will produce simple features, which will be convolved and filtered into deeper layers to produce complex features for artery-vein and DR classification. Further investigation of the relationship between the new features learned through the machine learning process and clinical biomarkers will allow us to optimize the design for better DR classification. Success of this project will pave the way towards using quantitative OCTA features for early DR detection, objective prediction and assessment of treatment outcomes. Project Narrative This project is to establish quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). By translating subjective findings into objective assessments, this study will standardize clinical OCTA for eye disease detection and treatment assessment.

With the support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular, adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology, immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use. Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A PROJECT NARRATIVE  Beyond their traditionally known roles as carriers and regulators of genetic information, nucleic acids have auspiciously emerged as versatile therapies for taking advantage of cellular pathways to drive the sensing, targeting, and silencing of a variety of diseases. With MIRA support, we will explore additional nanotechnology- based therapeutic options that enlist a biocompatible nucleic acid-encoded platform (SMART NANPs) for the controlled immunostimulation and modulation of therapeutic responses. This research program aims to advance the envisioned technology towards personalized medicine and aid in addressing top public health challenges in the U.S. as they relate to cancer (through vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation), and drug overdose and safety (through the biodegradable nature of the platform and its functional regulation).",SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses,10086567,R35GM139587,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biopolymers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Learning ', ' monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Technology ', ' Thrombin ', ' Thrombase ', ' fibrinogenase ', ' Translations ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' disability ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Source ', ' biocompatibility ', ' biomaterial compatibility ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Immunomodulation ', ' immune modulation ', ' immune regulation ', ' immunologic reactivity control ', ' immunomodulatory ', ' immunoregulatory ', ' immunoregulation ', ' Modality ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Property ', ' nano tech ', ' nano technology ', ' nano-technological ', ' nanotech ', ' nanotechnological ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' therapy outcome ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' next generation ', ' nanoparticle ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' Biodistribution ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' genetic information ', ' Formulation ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHARLOTTE,R35,2021,141556
"Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots  Emergence of undervaccinated geographical clusters for diseases like measles has become a national concern. A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in recent months, despite high MMR coverage in the United States ( 95%). Such undervaccinated clusters can act as reservoirs of infection that can transmit the disease to a wider population, magnifying their importance far beyond what their absolute numbers might indicate. The existence and growth of such undervaccinated clusters is often known to public health agencies and health provider networks, but they typically do not have enough resources to target people in each such cluster, to attempt to improve the vaccination rate. Preliminary results show that not all undervaccinated clusters are “equal” in terms of their potential for causing a big outbreak (referred to as its “criticality”), and the rate of undervaccination in a cluster does not necessarily correlate with its criticality.  However, there are no existing methods to estimate the potential risk of such clusters, and to identify the most “critical” ones. Some of the key reasons are: (i) purely data-driven spatial statistics methods rely only on immunization coverage, which does not give any indication of the risk of an outbreak; and (ii) current causal epidemic models need to be combined with detailed incidence data, which has not been easily available.  This proposal brings together a systems science approach, combining agent-based stochastic epidemic models, and techniques from machine learning, high performance computing, data mining, and spatial statistics, along with novel public and private datasets on immunization and incidence, to develop a novel methodology for identifying critical clusters, through the following tasks: (i) Identify spatial clusters with signiﬁcantly low immunization rates, or strong anti-vaccine sentiment; (ii) Develop an agent based model for the spread of measles that incorporates detailed immunization data, and is calibrated using a novel source of incidence data; (iii) Develop methods to ﬁnd and characterize critical spatial clusters, with respect to different metrics, which capture both epidemic and economic burden, and order underimmunized clusters based on their criticality; and (iv) Use the methodology to evaluate interventions in terms of their effect on criticality. A highly interdisciplinary team involving two universities, a health care delivery organization and a state department of Health, will work together to develop this methodology. Characterization of such clusters will enable public health departments and policy makers in targeted surveillance of their regions and a more efﬁcient allocation of resources. Project Narrative  This project will develop a new methodology to quantify the potential risks of under-vaccinated spatial clusters for highly infectious diseases. It will rank the clusters based on their economic and epidemic burden which will enable public health ofﬁcials in targeted surveillance and interventions, to mitigate their risk.",Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots,10197938,R01GM109718,"['Affect ', ' California ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health delivery systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Clusterings ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Measles ', ' Rubeola ', ' morbilli ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York ', ' Oregon ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine ', ' MMR Vaccine ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' health organization ', ' Herd Immunity ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Vaccinated ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' demographics ', ' economic outcome ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' population based ', ' public health intervention ', ' social media ', ' Immunize ', ' provider networks ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' diverse data ', ' data diversity ', ' vaccine hesitancy ', ' hesitant to vaccination ', ' vaccination hesitancy ', ' vaccine hesitant ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,321062
"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance.

"The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD Project Summary To reduce the increasing societal and financial burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), prevention is critical. Even small improvements of the modifiable dementia risk factors on the individual level have the potential to lead to a substantial reduction of dementia cases at the population level. The disease processes occur for years though symptoms typically appear after age 60. Thus, identifying those at risk early for intervention is crucial. Studies among adults aged 60 years and older have identified performance-based measures of impairment in physical function as early indicators of ADRD, three or more years prior to onset. To improve earlier prediction of ADRD, we need research on adults aged 51-59 years to assess the relationship between physical functional impairment and likelihood of ADRD onset years later. Further, given the burden of administering performance-based measures of physical function, it would be advantageous to use patient- reported metrics of limitation in physical function for ADRD prediction. We propose using the 1998-2018 nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of adults aged 51-59 years to determine the extent to which patient-reported measures of function would facilitate efficient ADRD risk identification. Primary study aims are to: 1) To identify the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function in midlife predict future late-onset ADRD. We will use standardized (RAND HRS) self-reported measures of function and the Langa-Weir ADRD algorithm available in the HRS. Working hypothesis: Limitations in physical function, defined using summary measures of self-reported physical function predict onset of ADRD 4 to 20 years later. 2) Verify that sub-groups of adults, defined by limitations in physical function, aged 51-59 are at higher risk of developing ADRD. We will verify existence of sub-groups (identified in our preliminary analyses) using a computational systems approach (cluster analysis) are predictive of onset of ADRD through 2018, in adjusted analyses. Working hypothesis: Sub-groups of middle-aged adults with unique patterns of limitations in physical function are at higher risk of developing ADRD than those without physical functional deficit 4 to 20 years later, independent of related factors. This proposal addresses the objectives of PAS-19-391 in several ways. First, the Principal investigator (PI), an early stage investigator, is committed to a career in ADRD research. Second, the investigative team has training in non-neurological medical fields and will shift their research focus to ADRD prevention within their fields. Third, the PI has experience with an existing dataset (HRS); and will use it to assess age-related changes in non-cognitive processes that may be early signs of ADRD. Finally, the PI published an HRS study reporting that physical functional decline precedes the onset of diabetes, a risk factor for ADRD. Our proposal builds on this work. The successful completion of the proposed study will ascertain the extent to which self-reported impairment in physical function during midlife, predicts future ADRD, thereby offering a new, efficient mechanism for early identification of ADRD. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple worldwide by 2050 unless effective measures to treat or delay the onset of the disease are implemented.1 The same study found that about 35% of ADRD could be delayed or prevented through modifiable health and lifestyle factors from different phases of life. To identify adults at risk of ADRD early, our study among adults aged 51-59 seeks to determine the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function are early indicators of ADRD and to identify sub-groups of people with unique patterns of limitation in physical function that are early indicators of ADRD.",The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD,10106121,R03AG070668,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' late onset alzheimer ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Physical Function ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Subjects Selections ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' Prevention trial ', ' Genetic study ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative measure ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' performance based measurement ', ' performance based measures ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,287889
"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level. Findings from this work will provide insight into the diagnosis of MDD characterized by valence imbalance.",Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making,10102280,F30MH118888,"['Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Appetitive Behavior ', ' Searching Behavior ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cues ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Punishment ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Sucrose ', ' Saccharose ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Work ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' avoidance behavior ', ' base ', ' goal oriented behavior ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' Chronic depressive disorder ', ' chronic depression ', ' experience ', ' light intensity ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' motivated behavior ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' optogenetics ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' depression model ', ' depressive model ', ' social defeat ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,38161
"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients.

"Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome PROJECT SUMMARY Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome Hippocrates said ~2,400 years ago: “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”. It is now well known that this is largely due to the “diet-microbiota-host” interactions that happen in the human gut. In particular, microbial degradation of carbohydrates can produce a variety of metabolites, which have a profound impact on human health. As a bioinformatics researcher in the Nebraska Food for Health Center, the long-term interests of the PI include: (i) develop specialized computational tools for better functional annotation of food-digesting microbial genomes and metagenomes, and (ii) characterize enzymes and other genetic elements that connect microbes, diets, and human health. The objective of this R01 project is to develop a suite of bioinformatics tools for functional annotation of carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) and CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs) in human gut microbiome. The PI has over 10 years of experience in CAZyme bioinformatics tool development, and maintains a well-recognized CAZyme annotation database and web server called dbCAN (http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2). This project aims to further dbCAN development to address fundamental personalized nutrition questions: (i) is a gut microbe able to utilize a specific type of glycan? (ii) can a person carrying certain gut microbes respond to an individualized diet (e.g., prebiotics: dietary compounds that are beneficial to human health)? To address these questions, new CAZyme annotation tools must have the ability to predict the carbohydrate substrates of CAZymes. Recent research has found that different CAZyme encoding genes are often co-localized with each other and with other genes (e.g., those encoding sugar transporters, regulators, and signaling proteins) in bacterial genomes to form CGCs (also known as polysaccharide utilization loci or PULs). Thus, the foundation of the new tool development is that the gene membership (or functional domain composition) of a CGC can be used to predict its carbohydrate substrates (e.g., xylans, pectins, glucans, etc.). The innovation is that machine learning approaches will be used to analyze a large number of experimentally characterized PULs curated from literature, and the extracted sequence features will be used to build effective classifiers to predict and classify CGCs in new genomes/metagenomes. The expected outcome will be novel and user-friendly open source computer programs, databases, and web servers that allow automated CGCs identification and substrate predictions. The significance is that the new tools will facilitate the experimental characterization of more PULs and their carbohydrate substrates in human gut microbiome (also in other carbohydrate rich environments). Therefore, this project will contribute computational solutions to the research of personalized nutrition, e.g., analyze a person's gut microbiome to predict if this person can respond to diets containing certain prebiotic glycans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human gut microbes primarily feed on carbohydrate substrates derived from diet and host, and produce important metabolites that significantly influence host physiology and health. The functional annotation of the carbohydrate metabolic enzyme repertoire of gut microbes is poorly defined for most bacterial phyla, resulting in gaps in understanding of how microbial communities utilize these carbohydrates to influence human health. Creating new bioinformatics tools for predicting carbohydrate utilization will contribute to the arising microbiome-based personalized nutrition practice and aid in the development of therapeutic options to prevent/treat human metabolic disorders.",Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome,10099567,R01GM140370,"['Algorithms ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' whole grain ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Cluster ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Glucans ', ' Glucose Polymer ', ' Polyglucoses ', ' Glycosides ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Literature ', ' Mannans ', ' Mannan ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Persons ', ' Nebraska ', ' nutrition ', ' Pectins ', ' methoxy pectin ', ' methoxylpectin ', ' methoxypectin ', ' pectinic acid ', ' Physiology ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Starch ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Xylans ', ' Bacterial Genome ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' sugar ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' genetic element ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Purple Bacteria ', ' Proteobacteria ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bacteroidetes ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Signaling Pathway Gene ', ' Signaling Protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' microbiome ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' human-associated microbiome ', ' metagenome ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' prebiotics ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' microbial genome ', ' microbes genome ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' Microbe ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' tool development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' gut microbiome ', ' GI microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' enteric microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' gut-associated microbiome ', ' intestinal biome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' predictive tools ', ' annotation  system ', ' annotation framework ', ' annotation tool ', ' metatranscriptome ', ' Firmicutes ', ' host microbiota ', ' host microflora ', ' resident microbes ', ' resident microflora ', ' gut metagenome ', ' microbiome sequencing ', ' gut microbes ', ' gut microbial species ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' web server ', ' contig ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,R01,2021,302120
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology. The tool will be available in the public domain (NIH Toolbox) and will facilitate incorporation of psychiatric disorders into the precision medicine initiative.",Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan,10112310,R01MH117014,"['Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Calibration ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' male ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Data Compromising ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' data quality ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' trait ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Assessment Tool ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' intelligence quotient deficit ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' cognitive performance ', ' individualized prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' genomic variation ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' symptom cluster ', ' Internet of Things ', ' protective factors ', ' PhenX Toolkit ', ' Phenx ', ' Psychoses ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,693835
"Focal nerve fiber layer reflectance analysis for glaucoma evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness, and effective glaucoma management requires early detection. Nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness measurement by optical coherence tomography (OCT) is useful for confirming the diagnosis of glaucoma, but its diagnostic sensitivity is not sufficient to be used alone for population-based screening.  NFL reflectivity is reduced in glaucoma subjects, presumably due to loss of axons and axonal microtubule content. But its diagnostic value is diminished by its dependence on the incident angle of the OCT beam, which is highly variable in routine clinical imaging. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy can be boosted by reducing incidence angle effects with azimuthal filtering of NFL reflectance profile, and by analysis of focal rather than average reflectance changes. The preliminary result, bases on 100 normal and glaucoma eyes, showed that the diagnostic sensitivity was significantly improved from 71% for average NFL thickness to 97% for focal NFL reflectance loss in PG eyes, at a 99% specificity cutoff. We propose to validate this result in the large Advanced Imaging for Glaucoma (AIG) study dataset that comprises 249 perimetric glaucoma (PG), 252 pre-perimetric glaucoma (PPG), and 145 normal participants. The AIG study has an average follow-up of more than 4 years, which also allows assessment of the accuracy in predicting glaucoma progression. 1. Reproduce the high diagnostic accuracy of focal NFL reflectance loss analysis using the large AIG  dataset. If we could again demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy in the AIG dataset, especially in the PPG  and early PG subgroups, this could bring OCT glaucoma evaluation into the realm of population screening.  The primary performance metric will be the diagnostic sensitivity at a fixed 99% specificity cut point. 2. Use focal NFL reflectance loss to predict visual field (VF) conversion and progression. In the AIG  study, focal thinning of the macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) and peripapillary nerve fiber layer (NFL)  were found to be the best predictors of VF conversion (development of glaucomatous VF abnormality in an  eye with normal baseline VF) and progression (significant worsening of VF). We hypothesize that focal  NFL reflectance loss would have even better predictive accuracy. Predictive accuracy will be assessed  using the area under the receiver operating curve (AROC) and logistic regression (odds ratio). 3. Combine OCT reflectance and structural maps using machine learning to improve glaucoma  diagnostic accuracy. A combination of disc, peripapillary, and macular thickness parameters had  previously been shown to be synergistic, producing higher AROC than any single parameter. We  hypothesize that the addition of the novel NFL reflectance loss map to the set of input parameters will  further enhance the diagnostic accuracy of a machine learning algorithm. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness using OCT is widely used in clinic for glaucoma diagnosis, but the diagnostic sensitivity is limited. Combination of NFL reflectivity and other structural OCT information promises to improve the diagnostic accuracy to a level where population-based screening would be feasible.",Focal nerve fiber layer reflectance analysis for glaucoma evaluation,10108277,R21EY032146,"['Algorithms ', ' Axon ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Incidence ', ' Maps ', ' Microtubules ', ' Micro-tubule ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Patients ', ' Retina ', ' Specificity ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Evaluation ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' Diagnostic Specificity ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Management ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' macula ', ' macular ', ' Population ', ' population based ', ' screening ', ' clinical imaging ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,192500
"Web-based Automated Imaging Differentiation of Parkinsonism SUMMARY Across the globe, there has been a considerable growth in the number of people diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Estimates indicate that from 1990 to 2015 the number of Parkinsonism diagnoses doubled, with more than 6 million people currently carrying the diagnosis, and by year 2040, 12 and 14.2 million people will be diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy Parkinsonian variant (MSAp), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are neurodegenerative forms of Parkinsonism, which can be difficult to diagnose as they share similar motor and non-motor features, and they each have an increased chance of developing dementia. In the first five years of a PD diagnosis, about 58% of PD are misdiagnosed, and of these misdiagnoses about half have either MSA or PSP. Since PD, MSAp, and PSP require unique treatment plans and different medications, and clinical trials testing new medications require the correct diagnosis, there is an urgent need for both clinic ready and clinical-trial ready markers for differential diagnosis of PD, MSAp, and PSP. Over the past decade, we have developed diffusion imaging as an innovative biomarker for differentiating PD, MSAp, and PSP. In this proposal, we will leverage our extensive experience to create a web-based software tool that can process diffusion imaging data from anywhere in the world. We will disseminate and test the tool in the largest prospective cohort of participants with Parkinsonism (PD, MSAp, PSP), working closely with the Parkinson Study Group. The reason to test this in the Parkinson Study Group network, is because they are the community that evaluates Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in Parkinsonism. This web-based software tool will be capable of reading raw diffusion imaging data, performing quality assurance procedures, analyzing the data using a validated pipeline, and providing imaging metrics and diagnostic probability. We will test the performance of the wAID-P by enrolling 315 total subjects (105 PD, 105 MSAp, 105 PSP) across 21 sites in the Parkinson Study Group. Each site will perform imaging, clinical scales, diagnosis, and will upload the data to the web-based software tool. The clinical diagnosis will be blinded to the diagnostic algorithm and the imaging diagnosis will be compared to the movement disorders trained neurologist diagnosis. We will also enroll a portion of the cohort into a brain bank to ascertain pathological confirmation and to test the algorithm against cases with post-mortem diagnoses. The final outcome will be to disseminate a validated diagnostic algorithm to the Parkinson neurological and radiological community and to make it available to all on a website. NARRATIVE In this proposal, we will be developing, disseminating, and evaluating a web-based software tool that can perform MRI analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinsonism. Our goal is to leverage our years of experience and algorithm development, to test a prospective cohort of Parkinson’s disease, Multiple System Atrophy, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. We expect that at the end of the project, we will have validated a web-based software tool that can use MRIs from different vendors to read, analyze, and predict the diagnosis of different forms of

"CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex in implementing and arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms used for strategic planning.",CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning,10168643,R01MH118925,"['Algorithms ', ' Animal Structures ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' M mulatta ', ' M. mulatta ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Monkeys ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Probability ', ' Pupil ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' Arbitration ', ' Arbitrating ', ' Competence ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' source guides ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' fiction ', ' fictional works ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,378388
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors.

"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10165490,R01AI148747,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibodies ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune condition ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Charge ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Physics ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Statistical Study ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' flu immunisation ', ' influenza virus vaccination ', ' vaccination against influenza ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Entropy ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' TcR Genes ', ' T-Cell Receptor Genes ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Speed ', ' immunological diversity ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Protein Motifs ', ' Amino Acid Motifs ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' information model ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' biophysical properties ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,528873
"Mapping the superficial white matter connectome of the human brain using ultra high resolution multi-contrast diffusion MRI Abstract In this 5-year R01 project entitled “Mapping the superficial white matter connectome of the human brain using ultra high resolution multi-contrast diffusion MRI,” we propose to create the first atlas of the human brain’s superficial white matter (SWM) using sub-millimeter ultra high resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI). The SWM is located between the deep white matter and the cortex. It plays an important role in neurodevelopment and aging, and it has been implicated in a large number of diseases including Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Despite its significance in health and disease, the SWM is vastly underrepresented in current descriptions of the human brain connectome. The SWM contains short, u- shaped association fiber bundles called u-fibers. Multiple challenges have thus far prevented comprehensive mapping of the human brain’s SWM. These challenges include the inadequate spatial resolution of dMRI data, which prevents u-fiber tracing using current tractography methods, as well as the small size, high curvature, and high inter-subject variability of the u-fibers. An additional challenge is the lack of ground truth information. Our understanding of human neuroanatomy relies heavily on the results of invasive tracer studies in monkeys, but the detailed neuroanatomy of the SWM in monkeys has not yet been systematically compiled or analyzed. We propose to address these challenges to create the most comprehensive description of the SWM to date. Our strategy includes using ultra high spatial resolution dMRI acquisitions (~700µm isotropic or better) at multiple echo times (TE), novel dMRI tractography methods designed for tracing u-fibers, anatomically informed machine learning to parcellate the u-fibers, and expert neuroanatomical generation of the SWM connectivity matrix from monkey tracer studies. Furthermore, we will develop a novel ontological framework to organize and name the SWM systems of the monkey and human brains. Overall, these steps will enable robust in-vivo tracing and capturing of inter-subject variability of the SWM of the human brain at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Our proposed deliverables will be the first comprehensive, anatomically curated atlases of the SWM in human and monkey, which will enable the study of the SWM in health and disease. We will publicly release all image data, tractography atlases, monkey connectivity matrices, extracted fascicles, and all software as open source.

"A machine learning ultrasound beamformer based on realistic wave physics for high body mass index imaging PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a significant and growing problem in the United States. Currently, 68.5% of the U.S. population is overweight, with approximately 37.7% of the overweight population being obese. The significant health problems associated with overweightedness and obesity, the “body habitus” of this population combined with the significant challenges in medical imaging of these individuals reduces the effectiveness of healthcare for this population. In ultrasound imaging, the quality of abdominal ultrasound exams are significantly affected by obesity.  Fundamentally, an ultrasound image relies on acoustic propagation to a target, reflection, and then propagation back to the surface. The process of beamforming, which converts the surface measurement to an image, is sensitive to the low amplitude reflections from different tissue layers and tissue properties. Typically, the additional fat and connective tissue layers in obese patients can significantly degrade ultrasound image quality by introducing multi-path reverberation and phase aberration that obscure or distort these low amplitude reflections.  However, due to the computational complexity of describing ultrasound propagation and reflection in heterogeneous media, beamformers currently rely on simplified models that do not describe the propagation physics directly. We propose a generational leap in how we approach ultrasound beamforming by using physically and anatomically realistic wave propagation models and measurements that can effectively harness the power of data-driven and rapidly evolving machine learning beamformers. A custom highly realistic simulation tool that we have developed will use acoustical maps of the fine structures in the human body based on photographic cryosections. This physics-based approach will allow us to develop high quality training data and to understand the physical mechanisms for image quality improvement. These simulations will be calibrated to ex vivo and in vivo human data to subsequently generate a large data set that can be used to train a machine- learning-based real-time beamformer. We will focus on two sources of image degradation which we have identified to be particularly deleterious: multipath reverberation and aberration of the focusing profile. The proposed neural network beamformer filters incoherent noise, such as multi-path reverberation, and corrects aberration in the radiofrequency channel signals.  After training the beamformer and implementing it in real-time, a pilot human study in liver ultrasound imaging will be conducted to determine the improvement in image quality in high-body-mass index individuals, where diagnostic imaging is problematic due to image degradation. This technique is highly translatable to other clinical scenarios, varying from cardiac to transcranial to obstetric imaging, by changing the anatomical model. Furthermore, the physical concepts that will be extracted from the learned representation, can be used to improve the design process for ultrasound equipment, including transmit sequences, and transducers. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Ultrasound beamforming, the process of transforming ultrasound into an image, is based on the principles of wave propagation which are complex due to the soft tissue structure in the human anatomy. Currently, ultrasound imaging uses simplified models of wave propagation. Here we address these limitations with physically and anatomically realistic propagation models based on the human anatomy that can effectively train and harness the power of machine learning beamformers. This technique directly addresses the principal challenge and objective of ultrasound beamforming, which is to limit unwanted acoustical effects from superficial tissue while maximizing signal from deep targets. The advancement of the proposed technology addresses the clear clinical need to provide diagnostic imaging to the growing population of body-limited imaging cases.",A machine learning ultrasound beamformer based on realistic wave physics for high body mass index imaging,10130064,R01EB029419,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Carotid Arteries ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Equipment ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transducers ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' liver imaging ', ' liver scanning ', ' Left ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' tool ', ' Supersonic waves ', ' Ultrasound waves ', ' Ultrasonic wave ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' human data ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' human study ', ' Population ', ' prototype ', ' tissue phantom ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' imaging system ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' high body mass index ', ' high BMI ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,521287
"Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo 1 Dermatologists rely on visual (clinical widefield) and dermoscopic examination of skin lesions to guide the need  2 for biopsy. With this approach, sensitivity is high, but specificity tends to be quite variable and lower, resulting  3 in millions of biopsies of benign lesions every year. To improve specificity, several optical technologies are  4 being developed to noninvasively detect skin cancer. Of these, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is the  5 furthest advanced in clinical utility, proven for diagnosing skin cancers with high sensitivity and specificity.  6 RCM imaging, guided by dermoscopy, detects skin cancers with 2 times superior specificity, and reduces the  7 benign-to-malignant biopsy rate by 2 times, compared to that with dermoscopy alone. In 2016, the Centers for  8 Medicare and Medicaid Services granted current procedural terminology (CPT) reimbursement codes for RCM  9 imaging of skin. RCM imaging combined with dermoscopy is now advancing into clinical practice, sparing pa- 10 tients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. However, toward widespread acceptance and adoption, a 11 key challenge is that clinical widefield examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as 12 three separate procedures with separate devices. Clinicians do not precisely know the location of RCM imag- 13 es relative to the surrounding contextual lesion morphology that is seen with clinical widefield examination and 14 dermoscopy, resulting in lower and more variable diagnostic accuracy (particularly, sensitivity, positive and 15 negative predictive values). We propose a novel solution: (i) a new objective lens with an integrated micro- 16 camera, to deliver a concurrent widefield image of the skin surface surrounding the location of RCM imaging; 17 (ii) a new software algorithm for widefield image-based tracking of the location of RCM images within a dermoscopic 18 field of view; (iii) a new diagnostic approach that will proactively use widefield imaging to locate RCM images in 19 dermoscopic images. We intend to deliver this integrated widefield clinical, dermoscopic and RCM imaging ap- 20 proach into the clinic, toward a new standard for more accurate, consistent and faster RCM imaging to guide 21 patient care. Preliminary studies with a “mock” objective lens and micro-camera on a bench-top set-up 22 demonstrated excellent optical sectioning (~2 µm) and resolution (~1 µm) for RCM imaging, and accurate and 23 repeatable location of RCM fields-of-view within the widefield image. RCM images showed excellent cellular 24 and morphologic detail in vivo. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a handheld reflectance confocal micro- 25 scope with integrated widefield camera; (2) to develop image processing algorithms for real-time widefield im- 26 aging-guided tracking of RCM image locations within dermoscopic fields; (3) to test and validate performance 27 on 100 patients. Although our proposition is for skin lesions, the research will surely have wider impact for 28 imaging in other settings, particularly, with miniaturized confocal microscopes and endoscopes, which have 29 very small fields-of-view. We are a highly synergistic team from Montana State University, Memorial Sloan 30 Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.). RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Clinical examination and dermoscopy combined with reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging is a newly emerging optical imaging procedure that can noninvasively guide diagnosis of skin cancers, and reduce the need for biopsy.

"Systems-level identification of key regulators deciding immune cell state Abstract Understanding the mechanisms and identifying regulators of immune cell development and differentiation are critical for developing new and more effective therapeutics. The fast advancement of genomic technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the immune cells at the system level. The noise in the high throughput measurements and the complexity of multiple omics data make it an urgent need for developing novel and powerful systems biology approach for integrative analysis to reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms for immune system. We propose a new method to integrate multiomics data at the genetic network level for identification of key regulators deciding the cell state and cell fate (Specific Aim 1). We will apply the method to systematically uncover the regulatory mechanisms in the mouse immune system by analyzing 86 immune cell populations (Specific Aim 2). We will also perform comparative analysis of the human and mouse immune cells to reveal the conserved regulatory code for immune cell specification (Specific Aim 3). We will rigorously assess the performance of the computational analysis, experimentally confirm the importance of the identified key regulators and investigate their roles in regulating immune cell functions.

"PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Title: PRedictiOn algorithms for the deTECTion of early stage pancreatic cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Summary Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. A major reason for the lethal nature of this disease is the lack of effective strategies for early detection. As a result, the vast majority of cancers are detected at a very late stage. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer could be due to many reasons including, 1) lack of a clear quantitative or algorithm-based definition of a high-risk population who would benefit from active surveillance, 2) suboptimal use of image findings that could potentially foretell a growing tumor, 3) system or referral-related delay from time of abnormal finding to diagnosis and treatment. Methods to accelerate the detection of pancreatic cancer leading to increased proportion of early stage tumors at the time of diagnosis have the potential to have an immediate impact on survival. The objective of the proposed work is to establish a platform for development and implementation of a data-driven approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer within an integrated care setting. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on development of empiric algorithms for prediction of early stage pancreatic cancer as well as systematic pancreatic cancer-risk stratification of patients based on natural language processing-aided extraction of pancreatic features from existing pre-diagnostic imaging reports to enhance understanding of the natural history of disease progression. Finally, we will conduct a prospective cohort study to assess the accuracy of an algorithm-based approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Pancreatic cancer is most often diagnosed in a late, incurable stage. Population-based screening is not effective based on the relatively low incidence of this disease. The current study seeks to develop and apply an alternative approach to enhance our ability to identify patients with early stage pancreatic cancer through use of an electronic ‘trigger’ system based on information gathered from large electronic health systems.",PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT),10201527,R01CA230442,"['Algorithms ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Staging ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' disease natural history ', ' Participant ', ' Health Information System ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' demographics ', ' tumor ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' recruit ', ' Veterans Health Administration ', ' Veterans Health Affairs ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,816240
"Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry - Study Sites Abstract/Summary Globally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) outrank infectious diseases in terms of public health burden. Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death worldwide. In this application we will explore the genomic risk for common CMD, including hypertension, stroke, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and kidney disease, and related traits (including BMI, blood pressure, lipid, glucose, insulin and creatine) across populations with African ancestry (AA). There is evidence to suggest that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) translate poorly from a discovery study in one ancestral population (e.g. European Americans) to a target population (e.g. sub-Saharan Africans), especially when they are separated by large genetic differences. However, this has not been evaluated with large, well-powered AA datasets. Furthermore, the high genetic diversity and population structure among non-European Ancestry (EA) populations need to be investigated to understand the performance of PRSs in other regions populated by people with diverse genomic backgrounds. We bring together the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Consortium (H3Africa), other African, Jamaican and African American core cohorts, to develop a joint resource of over 50,000 participants with relevant phenotype and genomics data, referred to as the CARdiometabolic Disorders IN African-ancestry PopuLations (CARDINAL) Study Site. In addition, the CARDINAL Study Site will include 5 replication cohorts with >100,000 participants from diverse ancestry populations. Our main objective is to establish a Study Site for PRS Methods and Analysis for AA Populations and to collaboratively generate and refine PRS for other populations of diverse ancestry by integrating existing datasets with genomics and phenotype data for a range of complex diseases and traits. Our first aim is to integrate phenotype and genomic datasets from ~50,000 African individuals from seven individual cohort studies. Subsequently, we will evaluate PRSs and develop a novel method that takes into consideration, ancestry-specific genomic regions to improve prediction of PRSs in populations characterised by genetic sub-structure. Finally, we will develop an interactive dashboard for dissemination of PRS-related data from diverse ancestry populations. CARDINAL Study Site is ideal for generating novel biologic insights into complex disease etiology, with applications in global populations. Members of the CARDINAL team have successfully worked together for about a decade, generating and disseminating scientific knowledge through high impact publications. By establishing a Study Site in the Polygenic Risk Score Diversity Consortium, CARDINAL brings the largest cohort of African-ancestry participants to the table, to explore the genomics contribution to common CMDs and other NCDs. Narrative Cardiometabolic diseases are on the increase worldwide, contributing to high levels of morbidity and mortality, with limited resources among lower-resource populations in North America and Africa to prevent disease, make diagnosis and clinically manage patients. In this study we bring together ~50,000 African-ancestry participants (African American, Jamaicans and continental African) to form the CARDINAL study to assess and develop polygenic risk scores for cardiometabolic diseases and traits, and to develop analytic approaches for multi-ethnic cohorts leveraging the increased genetic diversity and lower linkage disequilibrium in African genomes. This research will lead to a better understanding of the transferability of polygenic risk scores from discovery to target populations of different ethnicities, informing prevention and diagnostic strategies that could contribute to the development of effective public health policies.",Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry -

"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame.

"Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract:  The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging due to its clinical heterogeneity and lengthy differential diagnosis. The incorrect assignment of a diagnosis of MS occurs in approximately 9% of newly evaluated patients and is associated with considerable clinically important, and avoidable, medical risk, morbidity, and healthcare costs. At the same time studies have demonstrated that many patients encounter a significant diagnostic delay prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of MS. In such patients early and accurate diagnosis of MS can result in prompt initiation of disease modifying therapy and consequent preventable disability. MS remains a clinical diagnosis and diagnostic criteria for MS are revised periodically, including most recently in 2017. Since implementation of the 2017 criteria, like all prior revisions, will continue to rely on subjective clinical and radiological assessments for its fulfillment, misdiagnosis will remain a risk.  New objective, automated, and clinically applicable approaches to MS diagnosis are needed. Recent preliminary data from cross-sectional pilot studies in patients with established diagnoses have shown promise for three new radiographic and three new laboratory methods to differentiate MS from other disorders. The present study will evaluate these six methods for the first time in a prospective cohort of 125 patients undergoing an initial evaluation for MS at an academic MS subspecialty center. The specificity and sensitivity of each method will be compared to fulfillment of 2017 MS diagnostic criteria at the time of initial clinical evaluation. Using diagnostic thresholds developed from this analysis, a two year post-enrollment analysis will also be performed in participants who did not meet 2017 criteria initially but did so during the subsequent two year interval to determine if the study methods could have predicted a diagnosis of MS earlier in such patients. The use of a multimodal and machine-learning approach to evaluate the integration of each of these six new methods which represent different aspects of MS neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes will also be performed during each analysis, and such a combination of radiographic and laboratory methodology may provide superior diagnostic accuracy compared to any given method alone.  Planned collaborative career development, mentoring, and advising activities will facilitate acquisition of specific advanced quantitative and qualitative research skills necessary to develop and coordinate collection of data for this large prospective cohort study to rigorously evaluate new diagnostic methods for MS and incorporate machine learning analyses. Successful completion of this study will provide experience and skills necessary to move the field of MS diagnosis forward through a planned prospective multicenter NIH R01 funded study. Project Narrative: A highly specific, sensitive, objective and automated novel diagnostic approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) is needed maximize early benefits of disease modifying therapy in patients with MS and to prevent the frequent problem of MS misdiagnosis. This project assesses three novel MRI techniques and three novel blood tests for the diagnosis of MS in a large prospective cohort undergoing a new clinical evaluation for suspect MS. While each method may show promise alone, utilization of machine learning methodology combining these approaches that represent different aspects of MS pathophysiology may demonstrate a highly accurate and clinically applicable methodology for MS diagnosis.",Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers,10070136,K02NS109340,"['Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' C-Peptide ', ' connecting peptide ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Red Cell ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Evolution ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings In response to an immunological challenge, immune cells act in concert forming complex and dense networks. A deep understanding of these immune responses is often the first step in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. Multivariate modeling algorithms can simultaneously consider all measured aspects of the immune system but requires prohibitively larger cohort sizes as technological advancements increase the number of measurements (a.k.a., “Curse of Dimensionality”). To address this, we propose a series of studies to develop machine learning algorithms for comprehensive profiling of the immune system in clinical settings. Particularly, for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell-level, we will leverage the stochastic nature of clustering algorithms to produce a robust pipeline for prediction of clinical outcomes. Next, we introduce the immunological Elastic-Net (iEN) algorithm, which addresses both the curse of dimensionality and reproducibility by integrating prior immunological knowledge into the models.  The cellular systems that govern immunity act through symbiotic interactions with multiple interconnected biological systems. The simultaneous interrogation of these systems with suitable technologies can reveal otherwise unrecognized crosstalk. In collaboration with several leading laboratories, we have produced multiomics datasets (including analysis the genome, proteome, microbiome, and metabolome) in synchronized groups of patients. Using these coordinated datasets, we will evaluate several algorithms for combining multiple biological modalities while accounting for the intrinsic characteristics of each assay, to reveal biological cross- talk across various systems and increase combined predictive power. Importantly, numerous population- level factors (including medical history, environmental, and socioeconomic factors) significantly impact the immune system and studies focused on homogenous patient populations often lack generalizability to other populations. To address this, we will develop machine learning strategies to integrate population-level factors directly into our immunological data. These models will objectively define subpopulations of patients and enable flexibility in the coefficients of the models (and hence, the importance of the various biological measurements) in each group.  This research program will be executed using data from several biorepositories focused on various diseases. This approach will ensure generalizability of our work to previously unseen datasets and increase the long-term impact of our findings. Throughout the proposal, a major area of focus is the development of visualization and model-reduction strategies that lay the foundation for interpretation of complex models. The machine learning algorithms developed will be readily applicable to a broad range of multiomics and multicohort studies and will be available as open-source software. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent technological advances have enabled the production of large immune monitoring datasets, providing an opportunity for systems-level efforts to harness the power of the immune system in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. In this project, we will develop machine learning algorithms for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell level, in a multiomics setting integrated with various other biological measurements, and subject to adjustments based on population-level factors. This work will provide a strong quantitative bridge between large-scale epidemiologic trends and deep biological profiling to investigate the complex mechanisms that govern the immune system in clinical settings.",Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings,10433729,R35GM138353,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Laboratories ', ' Immunologic Monitoring ', ' Immune Monitoring ', ' Immunological Monitoring ', ' Immunomonitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' socio-economic factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Measurement ', ' Immunological Models ', ' Immunologic Model ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' cohort ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' microbiome ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' patient population ', ' biological systems ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' genome analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' Immunodiagnostics ', ' immunological diagnostics ', ' ']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,96085
"Stanford Tissue Mapping Center HuBMAP Supplemental Research Proposal Overview We are requesting supplemental funds for two items:  1. Development of a new computational tool based on a recently developed deep-learning network called  ORCA to use spatial features with single-cell expression data from CODEX to more accurately transfer  cell type annotations to unlabeled CODEX datasets (50% funds are requested to fund a member from  Prof. Jure Leskovec from Computer Science at Stanford University to join our efforts at the Stanford  TMC). This tool has already been used to transfer cell type annotations to unlabeled HuBMAP donor  small intestine and large intestine single cell CODEX data, already saving nearly 100 hours of  annotations required for annotating 2 donors datasets, yet does not incorporate spatial annotations to  help with cell type annotations.  2. An EvoSep Liquid Chromatography system (50% funds are requested) for scProteomics. It is one of the  few systems which can run a true low nano flow rate gradient ( <100 nl/min). Low nano flow can  dramatically improve sensitivity which is the key for the success of scProteomics using mass spectrometry. We will develop a new deep-learning network called ORCA to use spatial features within CODEX data to accurately assign cell type labels to unannotated CODEX datasets saving hundreds of hours of manual annotation.

"Molecular Basis of Hair Cell Stereocilia Bundle Morphology Project Summary: The sensory cells of the inner ear, the hair cells, carry a bundle of precisely organized stereocilia bundles on their surface. Stereocilia are microvilli-like protrusions detecting sub-nanometer vibrations enabling our perception of sound. This incredible sensitivity requires an ensemble of proteins, some of which form mechanical linkages at the surface of stereocilia. These linkages have long been visualized with electron microscopy, however, the specific function of some remain elusive. This proposal focuses on a specific novel protein, Polycystic Kidney and Hepatic Disease 1-Like 1 (PKHD1L1), which is thought to be a major component of the stereocilia surface coat and is hypothesized to facilitate stereocilia bundle cohesion. To understand the spatiotemporal distribution of the protein throughout development, as well as the mechanism by which it causes deafness when mutated, multiple high-resolution light and electron microscopy experiments using different imaging modalities are being performed, resulting in a plethora of 2D and 3D images containing a wealth of data which unfortunately are costly to analyze in their entirety. Often generated to answer one question, such data sets could be shared with the scientific community for other groups to reuse for their research needs. As data collection becomes increasingly more expensive and time consuming, more groups join in sharing their raw data sets with the scientific community, in various formats often unsuitable for easy analysis. Advances in machine learning for computer vision has made it feasible to automate these manual analysis tasks, however the development of such models is heavily bottlenecked by the availability of training data which has been properly prepared and annotated. This supplemental proposal aims to increase the availability of such training data by annotating and depositing a wealth of imaging data in such a way that they may be readily used for the training of machine learning models. We will annotate three types of imaging data we collect from wild-type and ko mice to study the role of PKHD1L1 in hair cells: 1) cochlear hair cells on 3D confocal Z-stacks, 2) hair cell stereocilia and mitochondria in our 3D focused ion beam scanning electron micrograph volumes, and finally 3) stereocilia (in 2D) on our scanning electron micrographs of cochlear hair cell bundles. These annotations will be evaluated by our collaborators specializing in machine learning volumetric image segmentation to help us assess data biases, assess generalizability of our data annotation, and demonstrate the usability of the data in AI/ML applications through mini-AI/ML applications as a proof of concept. A special attention will be given to documenting our data and demonstrating their usability by retraining open-source machine learning algorithms both, with the help of our collaborators, and in-house. The data, annotations, documentation, and example use cases will be publicly hosted in open repositories. There is currently a dearth of machine learning work in the hearing field. By publicly releasing machine learning ready image data, our work will encourage the development of models that have the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency and throughput of future image analysis. Project Narrative – Public Health Relevance The goal of this study is to understand the function of Polycystic Kidney and Hepatic Disease 1-Like 1 (PKHD1L1), a novel hearing loss protein with no previous implications in hearing function. We show that absence of PKHD1L1 from the mouse inner ear sensory cells leads to a hearing loss, and understanding the mechanisms by which PKHD1L1-deficient mice develop a hearing loss is the central aim of this project. Identification and characterization of new hearing loss genes enhances the diagnostic potential for undiagnosed hereditary deafness cases in humans, and serves a foundation for developing candidate-based hearing restoration therapies.",Molecular Basis of Hair Cell Stereocilia Bundle Morphology,10410746,R01DC017166,"['Adhesions ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory Perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' sound perception ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cadherins ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Charge ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Dental crowns ', ' Crowns ', ' Data Collection ', ' deafness ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Fluorescent Antibody Technique ', "" Coon's Technic "", "" Coon's Technique "", ' Fluorescent Antibody Technic ', ' Fluorescent Antinuclear Antibody Test ', ' Immunofluorescence Technic ', ' Immunofluorescence Technique ', ' fluorescent antibody ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Hair Cells ', ' Corti Cell ', ' ear hair cell ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interferometry ', ' Ions ', ' Polycystic Kidney Diseases ', ' Polycystic Kidney ', ' Labyrinth ', ' Internal Ear ', ' inner ear ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Manuals ', ' Membrane Fusion ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' tectorial membrane ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Label ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Vestibular Hair Cells ', ' Equilibrium Hair Cell ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Morphology ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' light microscopy ', ' nano meter ', ' nanometer ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vibration ', ' Height ', ' extracellular ', ' cohesion ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' protein distribution ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Resolution ', ' Transmembrane Domain ', ' TM Domain ', ' Transmembrane Region ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Molecular ', ' cellular microvillus ', ' Microvilli ', ' Microvillus ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Consumption ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' open source ', ' task analysis ', ' usability ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' Secure ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanosensing ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' hearing restoration ', ' restore hearing ', ' genetic deafness ', ' hereditary deafness ', ' inherited deafness ', ' ']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2021,306359

"HEALing LB3P: Profiling Biomechanical, Biological and Behavioral phenotypes Project Summary Identifying the optimal treatment for chronic low back pain (CLBP), the most prevalent of painful musculoskeletal disorders, on a patient-specific basis is an important and unresolved challenge. Tailoring interventions according to patient movement characteristics may improve clinical outcomes. Multi-modal studies are underway to characterize CLBP patients and to provide insight into the phenotypes associated with the experience of CLBP in relation to direct targeted and improved treatments. Comprehensive assessment of lumbar spine movement CLBP patients may be an important facet of such treatments such that patient-specific spine biomechanics may be included in predictive models to improve the ability to characterize them. To that end, the purpose of this administrative supplement is to explore additional clinical tools for characterizing lumbopelvic kinematics during functional tasks and daily activities. Specifically, this work aims to develop computer vision methods with which to characterize motions of the lumbar spine, thereby providing an accurate and unobtrusive clinical tool that can be used to supplement or replace currently considered tools such as wearable sensors, handheld sensors, and complex marker-based motion capture systems. This project will use video, marker-based 3D video motion capture data, and wearable inertial measurement data to create and validate single-camera computer-vision algorithms that can be used to compute known clinical metrics. During clinical assessments of patients in the Pitt LB3P Biomechanics Core study, participants are asked to perform functional tasks (e.g., repeated flexion/extension, axial rotation, lateral bending, lifting, chair rises) while wearing inertial measurement units (IMUs) attached to the upper back at T1, low back at L1 and L5, and thigh. The functional performance exams are also recorded by video. The standard metrics determined from these trials will include maximum and minimum lumbar spine and hip ROM, angular velocity at mid-excursion, maximum rotation acceleration, and phase angles for lumbar and hip joint rotation. The goal of this supplemental proposal is to use collected data to develop and train computer vision algorithms (so-called markerless motion capture) to quantify the metrics of interest. Use of video is much simpler for clinicians as it avoids the setup process required by wearable sensors. Recent developments in markerless motion capture have enabled simple camera systems to provide quantitative information about human motions but few studies have assessed computer vision for use in the clinical setting. The research plan in this proposal involves the use of existing data to train and validate computer vision algorithms, and then to further investigate their use in the clinical setting with single camera video to determine the extent to which video-based markerless motion capture may be clinically useful in the assessment of CLBP patients. Project Narrative Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder with major public health and socioeconomic impacts. A clinical measure that is used to characterize and ultimately prescribe treatment is the extent to which a patient has difficulty executing physical activities, but making reliable quantified measurements of patient motions can be challenging with conventional tools and even with modern motion capture systems. This research will investigate the degree to which a simple camera may be used in conjunction with machine-learning based computer vision algorithms to provide patient motion during physical activities that can be used in the assessment and treatment of CLBP.","HEALing LB3P: Profiling Biomechanical, Biological and Behavioral phenotypes",10415626,U19AR076725,"['Acceleration ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Goals ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Hip Joint ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Musculoskeletal Diseases ', ' musculoskeletal disorder ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rotation ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Lifting ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Participant ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' healing ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Chronic low back pain ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable biosensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' pain patient ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U19,2021,134064
"RADIOMIC APPROACHES TO IMPROVE TARGETING FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION CATHETER ABLATION PROJECT SUMMARY Although ablation to isolate pulmonary vein (PV) triggers has revolutionized atrial fibrillation (AF) management, performing effective AF ablation remains challenging. The procedure remains limited by targeting of ill-defined substrates, a 2-6% risk of major complications and limited success (single procedure 5-year success as low as 17-56%; 63-81% after the last ablation). A major recommendation of a recent NHLBI-sponsored report on the research needs and priorities for AF catheter ablation was to study how cardiac structure affects AF ablation success. There is a clear unmet need for non-invasive imaging tools to aid in improved patient selection, anatomic targeting and personalization of ablation or medical therapies. Our team has developed novel computational imaging (radiomics) methods to analyze cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans that were shown to predict the risk of recurrent AF post-ablation (AUC=0.84, N=167). These approaches included novel morphologic, fractal and atlas based features that teased out differences between PVs and the left atrial appendage (LAA), solely from analyses of CT scans. We propose to build upon our preliminary data using radiomic (computer extracted) features from radiographic images to use supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods that can analyze digitized radiographic and electro-anatomic images from the left atrium (LA) and PVs in over 2000 patients from two large AF ablation centers (Cleveland Clinic, Vanderbilt). Our project will focus on tackling the following main objectives: 1) Identify, evaluate and validate radiomic features and imaging-clinical nomograms predictive of recurrent AF after ablation; 2) Identify and validate regional radiomic sites predictive of post-ablation AF recurrence with the goal of identifying personalized targets for patients undergoing AF ablation; and 3) Identify biological correlates of radiomic features to understand the arrhythmogenic mechanisms underlying anatomic susceptibility to recurrent AF, using genomic analyses. Our 3 aims will test the following hypotheses: 1) Radiographic imaging can detect anatomic features that predict AF recurrence after ablation; 2) Regional radiomic features can predict sites that can be considered for additional ablation; and 3) Radiomic morphologic features are correlated with electroanatomic features and genomic variants associated with AF susceptibility. Tools developed will enable integration of radiographic and clinical data that may lead to improved patient selection, anatomic targeting and personalization of ablation or medical therapies. Successful project completion will yield a novel artificial intelligence-based imaging platform that can be tested for personalized targeting of AF ablation, as well as insights into the biologic basis of AF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) and its ablation remains challenging, preventing cure of the disease. This project will use artificial intelligence methods to identify regional CT imaging features with the goal of identifying personalized targets for ablation. The project will also seek to provide insights into anatomic differences between AF patients who are likely to suffer recurrence from those who are not, using genetic and electrical mapping.",RADIOMIC APPROACHES TO IMPROVE TARGETING FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION CATHETER ABLATION,10316365,R01HL158071,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atlases ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pulmonary veins ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Cardiac ablation ', ' Catheter Ablation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Fractals ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' auricular appendage ', ' Atrial Appendage ', ' Atrium Appendage ', ' Heart Atrium Appendage ', ' heart auricle ', ' Left atrial structure ', ' Left Atrium ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Ablation ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' voltage ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Length ', ' Nomograms ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Slice ', ' 4q25 ', ' Molecular ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' reconstruction ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' imaging platform ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' radiomics ', ' anatomic imaging ', ' anatomical imaging ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' ']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2021,749009
"Feeding Machine Learning Algorithms with Mechanistic Data to Predict Outcomes of Copper-Catalyzed Couplings PROJECT SUMMARY Cross-coupling reactions that combine aryl halides with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles to form C-N and C-O bonds are vital tools for the synthesis of medicinally-relevant molecules. These reactions are often catalyzed by complexes of transition metals, such as palladium or copper. Copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have several advantages over their palladium-mediated counterparts, but the disadvantages associated with copper catalysis often outweigh these benefits. Most Cu-catalyzed cross-coupling methods require high loadings of catalyst and high temperatures, and copper catalysts are often unable to effect cross-coupling of aryl chlorides. To address these issues, ligands that increase activity of copper catalysts for C-N and C-O cross-couplings have been sought, and oxalamide ligands have been shown to generate some of the most active catalysts. A series of publications by Ma have shown that such catalysts can, in some cases, react with 10,000 turnovers, and can cross-couple aryl chlorides, albeit at high temperature (120 °C) and loading of catalyst (5-10 mol %). However, identifying reaction conditions to promote cross-coupling of a given pair of substrates can be difficult – 12 different oxalamide ligands have been used to achieve couplings of different combinations of substrates in high yield. Herein, we propose to use mechanistic research, together with machine learning (ML), to facilitate the identification of reaction conditions for C-O cross-coupling reactions mediated by Cu salts with oxalamide ligands and to facilitate the development of improved ligands and methods. We hypothesize that mechanistic understanding can be used to build improved ML models that can use data sets on the order of 100-1000 points to predict reaction yield effectively. Once built, an ML model capable of predicting yield can be used to evaluate in-silico the potential of a ligand to generate a catalyst for the cross-coupling of aryl chlorides, or to predict reaction conditions to achieve high yield for a new combination of coupling partners. Our research strategy is as follows. First, we will elucidate the mechanism of C-O cross-coupling reactions catalyzed by copper salts with oxalamide ligands, and determine how ligand structure influences the reaction mechanism. The mechanistic insights gained will be used to identify or develop input for a machine learning model (features). We will use high-throughput experimentation tools to carry out 960 C-O coupling reactions with a variety of aryl halides, nucleophiles, and oxalamide ligands. The data set will be used to compare our hand- selected features with features selected by a ML algorithm by their ability to predict C-O coupling yield. The comparison will be made across three different ML optimization tasks. Our mechanistic studies will establish for the first time the mechanism of a C-O cross-coupling reaction catalyzed by Cu salts with oxalamide ligands, laying the foundation for the investigation of other C-O and C-N cross-coupling reactions using the same catalyst system. Our ML studies will establish methods that enable reasonably small datasets to predict reaction yield. PROJECT NARRATIVE The use of machine learning tools to predict the yield of chemical reactions is challenging, and often requires large quantities of training data. Herein, we propose to conduct mechanistic studies on C-O cross-coupling reactions promoted by Cu salts/oxalamide ligands, and to use the mechanistic information to design machine learning models that use small (100-1000 reactions) quantities of data to accurately predict reaction yield. Both the mechanistic data and the developed models will facilitate the identification of productive reaction conditions as well as the development of improved ligands and methods.",Feeding Machine Learning Algorithms with Mechanistic Data to Predict Outcomes of Copper-Catalyzed Couplings,10314079,F32GM140550,"['Adoption ', ' Air ', ' Bromides ', ' Catalysis ', ' Organic Chemistry ', ' Chlorides ', ' Communities ', ' Copper ', ' Cu element ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Foundations ', ' Hand ', ' Iodides ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Nitrogen ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Palladium ', ' Pd element ', ' Phosphines ', ' phosphane ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Salts ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' catalyst ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Equation ', ' high temperature ', ' High temperature of physical object ', ' chemical reaction ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' chemical reaction rate ', ' reaction rate ', ' transition metal ', ' Transition Elements ', ' Modeling ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Coupling ', ' aryl halide ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' in silico ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2021,65994
"POR and Training Program on Multidrug-Resistant Organisms ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most pressing public health priorities. AMR is thought to be re- sponsible for more than 35,000 deaths in the US with a projection of 300 million deaths worldwide by 2050. My original K24 application sought to increase my ability to conduct patient oriented research (POR) on antibiotic resistance and mentor a new generation of clinicians scientists on different aspects of this important public health threat. With support from the K24 award, I was able to markedly increase my research portfolio, launch a microbial genomics mission and increase my mentoring activities. Thus, the overarching goal of this com- petitive K24 renewal is to fully transition to an established investigator by continuing and further strengthening my POR portfolio and mentoring abilities. I also aim to fortify my leadership skills to expand an ambitious re- search and training program, focused on AMR. Supported in part by my original K24 award, I founded the Cen- ter for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics (CARMiG) at UTHealth. The vision of CARMiG was to amalgamate the world-class expertise available in the Houston’s Texas Medical Center (TMC) to serve as a major platform for cutting edge research programs and integrate a training mission to the highest level. I also led the creation of the Gulf Coast Consortium on Antimicrobial Resistance (GCC-AMR), an inter-institutional hub for AMR researchers across the TMC to interact and foster collaborations. We developed a robust training program on AMR, recruiting and supporting the career of a diverse pool of trainees (MD, PhDs and PharmDs) at different stages of their careers. My trainees have secured 4 NIH K developments awards (2 with perfect scores), and equivalent independent grants. Furthermore, the number of trainee’s publications has markedly expanded (94 publications as firs/corresponding author). Our NIH grant portfolio also grew with more than $ 20 million brought in as PI of NIH grants in the last 5 years, including a recent P01 program ($11m). We were also able to secure the first post-doctoral inter-institutional T32 training program on AMR. Thus, the foundations of my initial K24 program put me in an ideal position to sustain and further strengthen my research and training objectives. In my original K24 program I focused on the clinical and genomic aspects of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) one of the most challenging organisms in clinical settings. Using the expertise acquired in VRE, my K24 renewal will support new areas of research, including the intersection of microbiome science and AMR, genomics and molecular epidemiology of Gram-negative pathogens and use of machine learning to es- tablish clinical/genomic correlates in patients infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). The spe- cific aims are: i) strengthen my portfolio of POR related to AMR as the foundation for trainees to develop their careers, and ii) mentor talented young investigators in translational and POR focused on AMR. I plan to con- tinue my robust mentoring program that integrates the understanding of the molecular and genomic bases of resistance and their translation into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a top public-health priority. Training the next generation of clinician scientists and translational scholars is critical to tackle the dire consequences of AMR. After building a successful patient-oriented and translational program on AMR with a major training component, I plan to leverage these resources to expand my training, research and leadership capabilities in AMR, contributing to solve this major public health crisis.",POR and Training Program on Multidrug-Resistant Organisms,10301971,K24AI121296,"['Award ', ' Bacteremia ', ' bacteraemia ', ' Cefazolin ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' United Nations ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Generations ', ' Immunocompromised Host ', ' Immunocompromised ', ' Immunocompromised Patient ', ' Immunosuppressed Host ', ' immunosuppressed patient ', ' Enterococcus ', ' Streptococcus enterococcus group ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Medical center ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' resistance training ', ' strength training ', ' Genomics ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug Resistance ', ' Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Antibacterial Drug Resistance ', ' Multiple Antibacterial Drug Resistant ', ' Resistance to Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Antibacterial Drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Antibacterial Drug ', ' multi-drug resistant bacteria ', ' multidrug resistant bacteria ', ' Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance ', ' Vancomycin-resistant enterococci ', ' Vancomycin resistant enterococcus ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Microbiology ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Pharm.D.

"Liver Cirrhosis Network: Clinical Research Center - Mayo Clinic PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Therapies aimed at preventing development of cirrhosis-related complications are lacking. Statins have been shown to improve liver function and attenuate portal hypertension although definitive studies are lacking. Our investigative team has deep expertise in cirrhosis and portal hypertension including clinical, translational, and laboratory aspects of disease. Our aims in this proposal are: Aim 1. To conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with compensated cirrhosis that will serve as the foundation for discovery of novel mechanistic and therapeutic targets. We will consolidate a longitudinal database to (a) provide unique information on the natural history and outcomes of cirrhosis and (b) support translational research (proposed in Aim 3). This robust multicenter dataset will be used for the development and validation of an artificial intelligence-derived algorithm for prediction of decompensation combining extensive clinical, laboratory and radiographic data, including magnetic resonance elastography and electrocardiogram. Aim 2. To perform a multicenter prospective randomized phase 3 clinical trial of simvastatin versus placebo to improve outcomes in patients with compensated cirrhosis. This aim will test the hypothesis that simvastatin is superior to placebo for reducing complications of cirrhosis and overall mortality. This phase 3 efficacy trial will randomize patients to Simvastatin 20 mg or placebo daily with median follow up of 36 months. The primary endpoint will be development of varices, decompensating events or death analyzed as ordinal outcomes based six prognostic stages. Secondary endpoints will include fibrosis regression, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and cardiovascular complications. Aim 3. To identify novel pathogenic targets in cirrhosis progression through 2 Sub-aims: Sub-Aim 3a. To investigate the rate of telomere attrition in cirrhosis progression and decompensation. Telomere shortening has been observed in advanced cirrhosis and preclinical studies have shown reduced fibrosis with telomere length restoration. However, the rate of telomere attrition in cirrhosis and its association with disease progression remain unknown. Our proposal will serve as the basis for future studies assessing new therapies aimed at telomere length preservation in cirrhosis and effects of statins. Sub-Aim 3b. To measure circulating markers of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and its correlation to development of hepatic decompensation. Anticoagulation has been shown to reduce hepatic decompensation in a small trial of patients with cirrhosis. Our group has recently shown that NETs drive intrahepatic thrombosis, and inhibition of NETs reduces portal pressure in preclinical studies. Thus, the results of this sub-aim will serve as the foundation for future human studies investigating novel therapies aimed at disrupting NETs in the liver. Our center and team have substantial expertise in clinical trials and therapeutics for advanced liver disease and are thus well poised to conduct these studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will investigate the natural history of cirrhosis.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome-Wide Association Studies One promise of precision medicine for Alzheimer’s disease is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association in subjects ascertained with and without Alzheimer’s. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine for Alzheimer’s by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual Alzheimer’s patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to Alzheimer’s clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial Alzheimer’s data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on Alzheimer’s patients derived from a population-level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and Alzheimer’s disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the Alzheimer’s clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated Alzheimer’s knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source to the Alzheimer’s disease research community (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of Alzheimer’s disease result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help Alzheimer’s clinicians and researchers connect population-level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat Alzheimer’s patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome-Wide Association Studies,10284977,R01LM010098,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' PubMed ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' open source ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' Genetic study ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data preservation ', ' ClinVar ', "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", "" Alzheimer's patient "", ' virtual intervention ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,391879
"Computational Methods for Designing Optimal Genomics-guided Viral Diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract Viral genome sequencing is growing exponentially and cutting-edge molecular technologies, guided by genomic data, show great promise in detecting and responding to viruses. Yet we lack a computational framework that efficiently leverages viral data to design the nucleic or amino acid sequences applied by these technologies. The proposal provides a career development plan to (i) build computational techniques — algorithms, models, and software — that yield highly accurate diagnostic assays, with potential to outperform existing ones, and (ii) use the techniques to proactively design assays for detecting 1,000s of viruses. The project will first develop methods for designing optimal viral genome-informed diagnostics. The study will formulate objective functions that evaluate an assay’s performance across a distribution of anticipated viral targets. Combinatorial optimization algorithms and generative models, constructed in the study, will optimize the functions. The project will also develop datasets for training predictive models of assay performance, which are used in the objective functions, focusing on CRISPR-, amplification-, and antigen-based diagnostics. Preliminary experimental results suggest such models can render assays with exquisite sensitivity and specificity. The study will compare the algorithmically-designed assays to state-of-the-art tests for four viruses. With these methods, the project will design diagnostic assays that are species-specific and broadly effective across genomic diversity for all viruses known to infect vertebrates. The study will build a system to monitor the assays’ effectiveness against emerging viral genomic diversity and to continually update them as needed. To enable the broad adoption of these methods, the project will implement them efficiently in accessible software. The proposal aligns with a NIAID goal of improving diagnostics via data science. The methods developed here may also aid therapy and vaccine design, and will leave the world better prepared to combat viral outbreaks. The career development award will provide training for the candidate in applied areas of long-term interest to his career. The candidate has previous experience in developing computational methods and analyzing viral genomes. Through the award, he will gain new knowledge and skills in diagnostic applications, alongside formal and informal training in immunology, bioengineering, and related laboratory techniques. This training will help the candidate progress toward therapy and vaccine applications that could benefit from advanced computational methods. The Broad Institute provides a supportive environment for the candidate’s development, including career development workshops, research seminars aligned with the proposed plan, and opportunities to initiate collaborations with scientists having expertise complementary to the candidate’s. The research and training will help him form an independent research group focused on developing and applying computational methods to enable more effective microbial surveillance and response. Project Narrative Viral genomic data is reshaping how we prepare for and respond to viral threats, but there is a scarcity of computational techniques that harness this vast, ever-growing data for designing diagnostic assays. The project will develop and test algorithms, machine learning models, and software systems to efficiently design highly accurate diagnostic assays by optimizing well-defined objective functions, applied to multiple diagnostic technologies, and will build a resource of broadly effective diagnostic assays for 1,000s of viral species. The resource and software developed in the project will advance capabilities for detecting viruses, and the new methods may accommodate challenges in designing more effective viral therapies and vaccines.",Computational Methods for Designing Optimal Genomics-guided Viral Diagnostics,10284445,K01AI163498,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Award ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Dengue ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' Virus ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' microbial ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Genomics ', ' model design ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Update ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' combat ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Combinatorial Optimization ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' Data Science ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' supportive environment ', ' enthusiastic atmosphere ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' supportive atmosphere ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' 2019 novel corona virus ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' COVID-19 virus ', ' COVID19 virus ', ' CoV-2 ', ' CoV2 ', ' SARS corona virus 2 ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated corona virus 2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related corona virus 2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' SARSCoV2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome CoV 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona virus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona virus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 virus ', ' hCoV19 ', ' nCoV2 ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ZIKA ', ' viral genomics ', ' virus genomics ', ' antigen diagnostic ', ' antigen based diagnostics ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' detection assay ', ' accurate diagnostics ', ' ']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K01,2021,129165
"Dominance on the human genome and non-additive polygenic models for predicting complex traits Project Abstract Dominance is one of the most fundamental concepts in genetics and has many key implications in population genetics, as it ultimately determines how selection manifests in a population. However, despite its unarguable importance, dominance is also one of the least characterized quantities in genetics, especially in humans, with the major challenge being current methods cannot distinguish dominance from the fitness effect of genomic variants. This proposed K99/R00 work will systematically address this longstanding problem from a dual- perspectives, by inferring dominance in humans and quantitatively model its role in shaping the phenotypes of complex traits and diseases. Specifically, in Aim1, I will develop a powerful machine learning-based method to infer the realistic distribution of dominance on the human genome in megabase-scale, leveraging archaic introgressed ancestry in non-African populations that is sensitive to dominance variation in genomic regions. In Aim 2, I will develop non-additive polygenic models accounting for dominance in full genomic regions to identify complex traits profiled in UK Biobank that deviate from additive models, improve the accuracy of phenotype and disease risk predictions, and contribute to an in-depth understanding of complex trait biology. Finally, in Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will extend these approaches to infer dominance variation in worldwide populations and investigate how dominance, combined with selection and admixture, determines complex trait phenotypes in diverse human populations. The mentored phase of this work will take place at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UCLA, where Dr. Zhang will have access to rich training opportunities and be supported by active scientific communities, including numerous seminar series, journal clubs, and networking activities. Dr. Kirk Lohmueller (primary mentor) and Dr. Sriram Sankararaman (co-mentor) will train Dr. Zhang in computational and statistical methods in population genetics, machine learning applications, and large-scale disease association data analysis. The research trainings, collaborations, and professional development during the K99 phase will assist Dr. Zhang in becoming an independent investigator in human population genetics. Project Narrative Dominance plays a vital role in human evolutionary genetics both in terms of its fitness effect on functional genomic variants and how it shapes complex trait phenotypes, while its distribution on the human genome and biological effects on complex traits are poorly characterized. This work will fill a critical knowledge gap by producing a complete picture of dominance distribution in humans, which will shed a light into many unsolved questions in genetics, including the evolution of dominance. This work will further provide comprehensive statistical frameworks to model the relationship between dominance and complex trait phenotypes, which will substantially improve the transferability of biomedical applications in historically understudied populations, including disease risk prediction and the development of precision medicine.",Dominance on the human genome and non-additive polygenic models for predicting complex traits,10283330,K99GM143466,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demography ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Bionomics ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Evolution ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' human population genetics ', ' trait ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Study Subject ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Admixture ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' training opportunity ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2021,82828
"Advancing 3D optical body surface scan technology to assess physiological and psychological effects in highly obese population Project Summary Current techniques for measuring the physiological or psychological effects of obesity, and in particular bariatric surgery, either lack sensitivity, are invasive, or require expensive specialized devices. For measuring the physiological effects, BMI is commonly used to diagnose obesity despite the known shortcomings as a marker for metabolic syndrome. Biomarkers such as anthropometric measurements (e.g., waist-to-hip ratio) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) have been shown to be superior to BMI in predicting health risks associated with obesity, but these measures lack sensitivity, specificity, or are expensive. Another key morbidity associated with obesity is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The gold standard to the diagnosis and assessment of these conditions is histologic evaluation of liver biopsies. Fibroscan transient elastography is a noninvasive test which can also assess fibrosis, but high BMI and severe steatosis can decrease its accuracy. These approaches are either invasive, expensive, or relatively inaccurate. Measures of self-body perception are commonly used to assess psychological aspects of obesity, as body image is an important motivator for diet, physical activity, and weight loss intention. Body image perception is commonly assessed using self-reports and cartoon-like line drawings which are non-subject specific and insensitive. Based on our preliminary work (R21HL124443) that developed optical body scanning technology to capture 3D body shapes using inexpensive hardware, we propose to use the technology to study the physiological and psychological effects on subjects with severe obesity:  · Develop prediction algorithm for hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, adiposity, and blood biomarkers using optical  scans. The optical scan and biopsy data will be used as the training and validation set to develop a  machine learning algorithm to cheaply and non-invasively predict the biomarkers from 3D body surface data.  · Develop the use of optical scans for measuring the physiological effects of obesity. We will conduct a  cross sectional and longitudinal study to further assess the use of optical surface scans to determine  health indicators associated with obesity (using data from surface scan, DXA and serum biomarkers) for  one year following surgery. We will establish a database of such data along with software for data mining  the database.  · Develop the use of optical scans for measuring the psychological effects of obesity. We will collect 3D  surface geometry of each subject using optical scans and morph these to produce subject-specific images of larger or smaller body shape. We will use these images to study perception related to obesity and in particular patients undergoing post-operative body changes Project Narrative Precise optical scanning of 3D whole body shape is now possible with cheap commercial scanners available on smart phones and tablets. These cheap and accessible scans may hold a heretofore-untapped wealth of health- related information that can be utilized with machine learning. In this proposal, we use the technology to study the physiological and psychological effects in subjects with severe obesity.",Advancing 3D optical body surface scan technology to assess physiological and psychological effects in highly obese population,10280172,R01DK129809,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' Cartoons ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Explosion ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Morbid Obesity ', ' Severe obesity ', ' extreme obesity ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' liver biopsy ', ' Liver lesion biopsy ', ' Surface ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Waist-Hip Ratio ', ' waist-to-hip ratio ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' insight ', ' Liver Fibrosis ', ' fibrotic liver ', ' hepatic fibrosis ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Visceral ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Body Surface ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' success ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' gastric banding ', ' gastric bypass surgery ', ' implantable gastric stimulation banding ', ' obesity surgery ', ' stomach stapling ', ' weight loss surgery ', ' bariatric surgery ', ' DEXA ', ' DXA ', ' Dual-Energy Xray Absorptiometry ', ' Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Validation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' cost effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' elastography ', ' elastic imaging ', ' elasticity imaging ', ' Geometry ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' Longitudinal observational study ', ' Longitudinal observation study ', ' non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ', ' NAFLD ', ' non-alcohol fatty liver disease ', ' non-alcoholic liver disease ', ' nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' high body mass index ', ' high BMI ', ' ']",NIDDK,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,593040
"Real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAUS) scanner withsimultaneous fluence and motion compensation to guide and validateinterventions: system development and preclinical testing. Abstract The goal of this project is to develop a clinical real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAUS) system for molecular guidance of interventional procedures through a partnership between UW and GE Research. Recently, we proposed a new, fast-sweep concept for PA imaging. To put this concept into practice, we first developed a unique, compact, diode-pumped, tunable (700 -900 nm) laser operating at very high (up to 1000 Hz) repetition rates and relatively low (~ 1 mJ) pulse energies, and a fiber-optic delivery system to sequentially couple laser pulses into the imaging probe. In addition to US B-mode, and all other US modes, the system simultaneously produces real-time (50 Hz) spectroscopic PA images, which were combined for the first time for real-time PAUS imaging. A unique feature is automatic on-line laser-fluence compensation and motion correction, enabling quantitative optical absorption spectroscopy at every image pixel. Spectroscopy can identify substances opaque to US based on their molecular constituents (drugs/contrast agents), and quantify tissue functional changes (e.g., blood oxygenation and its concentration) within the image; in addition, manipulation with a needle is better visualized with PA. UW will work with GE Research to integrate spectroscopic PAUS into a high-end US scanner to create a clinical-grade PAUS system, and test whether it can improve interventional procedure guidance in general and, particularly, in ethanol (EA) ablation therapies of recurrent thyroid tumors. The prognosis for most people with thyroid cancer after primary treatment is very good, but the recurrence rate or persistence can be up to 30%. If recurrent cancer is confirmed, image-guided nonsurgical procedures such as EA or radio frequency ablation (RFA) are commonly used alternatives to more invasive procedures. Although US helps position EA and RFA needles, on-line imaging of the ablative area and confirmation of ablation remain difficult for US. When the recurrent nodule (especially the capillary network in it) is not entirely treated, the cancer will return with possible metastasis. We hypothesize here that real-time spectroscopic PAUS will improve the efficacy of ablation procedures and dramatically reduce procedure repetitions. If successful in this initial stage, the project will move to a clinical trial to both guide and validate ablative therapies and explore real-time spectroscopic PAUS for other interventional procedures. SA1 will integrate our unique laser and scanning fiber-optic delivery system with a clinical GE US scanner for real-time spectroscopic PAUS. Then, SA2 will develop real-time signal processing tools for motion correction and fluence compensation and imaging protocols for spectroscopic PAUS. SA3 will focus on optimizing the PAUS system using phantom and ex vivo studies. Finally, in SA4 the developed PAUS system will be used to test the clinical applicability of PAUS guidance with three in vivo models, including small animal studies of thyroid cancer, an animal model approximating human anatomy, and pilot measurements on human subjects. Real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAUS) scanner with simultaneous fluence and motion compensation to guide and validate interventions: system development and preclinical testing Narrative Real-time ultrasound (US) is commonly used to guide interventional procedures, but for injections of therapeutic agents such as ethanol, the drug itself cannot be directly visualized. Photoacoustics (PA), combining pulsed light delivery to the body with US detection of light absorbing structures within the body, has been proposed to bring a molecular dimension to US to help view molecular substances such as drugs, but its clinical translation has been greatly limited by both fundamental issues related to tissue motion and wavelength-dependent light intensity variations within the body and practical issues related to the size, speed, and expense of the laser systems typically used for imaging. Here we present a completely new approach integrating PA and US (PAUS) imaging to directly address both fundamental and practical issues limiting clinical translation, and will test it by developing and evaluating a clinical real-time PAUS system as a robust molecular guidance tool for interventional procedures.",Real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAUS) scanner withsimultaneous

"Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative Technology (AGILITY) Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The AGILITY (Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative TechnologY) trial will assess layered challenges in realizing precision medicine. This includes a limited genetic counseling workforce to facilitate test decisions, and existing inequities in access to genetic testing. To address these challenges, we will conduct a Type1 Hybrid Trial that includes three specific aims. The first aim is to take an existing clinical genetics chatbot and tailor it for use in population screening of gene variants that can lead to Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndromes, Lynch Syndrome, and Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Due to the prevalence of the variants and options for taking actions to reduce negative outcomes, 10 genes have been endorsed for population screening by the National Academy of Medicine and the American College of Medical Genetics. To validate the chatbot for the target population, we will use data from interviews with primary care patients and providers to learn the informational needs to achieve informed test decisions. Once the chatbot is validated, the second aim is to conduct a virtually-implemented randomized controlled trial with primary care patients from a variety of backgrounds. We will test non-inferiority of the chatbot in comparison to standard genetic counseling. We plan to enroll 2,400 adult participants from five racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse primary care clinics at the University of Florida Health System. Patients will be eligible to enroll in the trial if they have no higher risks for the screening conditions. [Those with higher risks will be offered the opportunity to undergo targeted genetic testing as is standard of care, and followed as a descriptive study arm.] Participants will be randomized to learn about testing via a clinical chatbot or a genetic counselor. Our primary outcome is informed choice about undergoing genetic testing. As such, those who decline testing are as informative as those who accept. Secondary outcomes include test-related distress, decisional conflict, and testing uptake. Informed choice will be assessed immediately following the decision, after receipt of results for those who accept testing, and 3 and 6 months later for all participants. To ensure success of the AGILITY Trial, investigators at RTI International will work with the Senior Associate Dean of Research, primary care providers, patients and the community advisory board at the University of Florida Health System to develop recruitment, engagement, and retention strategies. The third aim is to conduct an implementation assessment of the clinical chatbot as an intervention to optimize genetic counseling without compromising informed decision-making and to facilitate population screening. To do so, we will analyze interviews with participants, genetic counselors, and primary care providers participating in the trial, using recognized approaches to inform implementation. The AGILITY study will provide evidence in support of workable solutions to address the critical issue of how to provide robust and scalable genetic counseling around predictive genomics in routine clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE More efficient ways for people to make decisions about having genetic testing are needed. We will compare use of a chatbot to standard genetic counseling in helping healthy adults in a primary care setting make informed choices. If similar, this intervention can expand access to genetic testing to achieve greater equity.",Access to Genetic Information Leveraging Innovative Technology (AGILITY)

"Deep Learning Methods to Integrate Biological Information for Analysis of Single-cell RNAseq Data Project Summary The broad long-term objective of the project concerns the development of novel machine learning methods and computational tools for modeling genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The analysis of single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data presents substantial computational and bioinformatics challenges. The specific aim of the project is to develop novel model-based deep learning methods with prior biological information considered for modelling scRNAseq data. These problems are all motivated by the PI’s close collaborations with biomedical investigators. The proposed approaches are designed to integrate biological information for improving both analytical performance and biological interpretability. The methods hinge on novel integration of biological insights and deep learning methods for analysis of the noisy, sparse, and over-dispersed scRNAseq data, including zero- inflated negative binominal model, autoencoder, deep embedding, hyperbolic embedding, and reversed graph embedding. The new methods can be applied to two important biological problems using the scRNAseq technologies: cell type identification and discovery via clustering analysis and cell developments via trajectory inference. They will facilitate effective analyses of the increasingly important scRNAseq data sets and contribute to the important on-going studies that the PI is currently collaborating on, Paneth cell regulation and regeneration of human hair follicles. The project will develop practical and feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, and to evaluate the performance of these methods through real applications. The work proposed here will contribute deep learning methods to modeling scRNAseq data and to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and offer insights into each of the biological areas represented by the various data sets. All programs developed under this grant and detailed documentation will be made available free-of-charge to interested researchers. Undergraduates researchers from diverse backgrounds will be recruited as an integral part in the project for implementing most critical parts of the proposed aims. The research project will stimulate the interests of students so that they can consider a career in the biomedical sciences.

"Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Management in CKD ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, currently affecting >33.5 million adults world- wide. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also highly prevalent and affects 14% of the U.S. and North American population. The burden of AF is 3-fold higher in CKD and affects up to 25% of CKD patients. AF is strongly associated with risk of ischemic stroke and death; and these risks are even higher in patients with CKD. Even in the absence of clinical ischemic stroke, some studies have suggested that AF is also associated with excess risks of all dementia types, including Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, although definitive evidence is lacking. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by neurodegenerative changes in the brain, including amyloid depositions and neurofibrillary tangles. It is plausible that AF may lead to cerebral microinfarcts, cerebral hemorrhage and reduced cerebral blood flow, all which could promote Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Gaining a greater understanding of the association of AF with Alzheimer’s and other dementias is particularly important in the CKD population, in whom the incidence and prevalence of dementia is even higher compared with the general population; and in whom the cause of dementia remains elusive and thus largely untreated. Currently, data on the risk of dementia in patients with CKD and AF are limited and may provide new insight into the mechanisms that contribute to dementia in CKD patients. Further, data on whether treatment of AF mitigates risk of dementia are conflicting in all populations (regardless of CKD status). While there are some existing studies of treatment of AF and risk of dementia, most have limitations, including (1) a primary focus on anticoagulation and not a comprehensive evaluation of other AF therapies; (2) inclusion of selected populations and none with CKD; and (3) inadequate consideration of interim clinical measures that may affect receipt and outcomes of AF therapies. Therefore, the effects of successful treatment of AF on risk of dementia remains largely unknown. Further data could identify novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of dementia. We propose to efficiently leverage our unique research platform that includes “real-world” contemporary data to evaluate the risk of dementia in patients with AF, with and without CKD; as well as determine whether successful treatment of AF with a comprehensive range of therapies is linked to a lower risk of dementia. To conduct this work, we will perform a rigorous comparative effectiveness analysis of >500,000 patients with and without AF from two participating health care systems in California. This proposed supplemental project will yield key insights to understanding the link between AF and dementia; particularly in the high-risk population of those with CKD. Furthermore, the anticipated results could form the basis of future randomized clinical trials. NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation is very common, particularly in patients with kidney disease. Studies have suggested that atrial fibrillation may be linked to dementia. In this study, we will evaluate the risk of dementia in patients with concurrent atrial fibrillation and kidney disease; and determine whether successful treatment of atrial fibrillation is linked with lower risk of dementia in this population.",Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Management in CKD,10287433,R01HL142834,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' California ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' brain blood flow ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Vascular Dementia ', ' Arteriosclerotic Dementia ', ' vascular contributions to dementia ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Sinus ', ' Accessory Sinuses ', ' Nasal Sinuses ', ' Nasal cavity/Paranasal ', ' Nasal cavity/Paranasal sinuses ', ' Paranasal Sinuses ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Warfarin ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' tangle ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Oral ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' American ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' response ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' population based ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' cerebral microinfarct ', ' cerebral microinfarcts ', ' cerebral microscopic infarct ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' high dimensionality ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' comparative effectiveness analysis ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,409448
"Computational Pathology of Proteinuric Diseases Project Summary/Abstract: Computational Pathology for Proteinuric Glomerulopathies The presently employed morphology-based classification system of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease (MCD) does not adequately capture the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of these diseases and impairs the ability of clinicians to precisely define a patient’s disease, or predict outcome or effective intervention. The goal of this research is to advance the work of the glomerular disease research community by identifying biologically-relevant surrogates and subclasses of FSGS/MCD using computational pathology and machine learning methods. Prospective, longitudinal, multi-dimensional data sets that include digital kidney biopsies and molecular and clinical information can be analyzed by advanced “computer vision” methods and machine learning analytical approaches. This project will employ these rich resources and methods, which offer an unprecedented opportunity to leverage information derived from kidney tissue to improve the diagnosis, outcome prediction, and identification of glomerular disease mechanisms. The interdisciplinary team assembled to conduct this study has vast experience and a long-standing history of collaboration. In our preliminary studies we have demonstrated that (i) structural changes associate with outcomes and molecular mechanisms and improve clinical outcome prediction beyond current clinical approaches, and that (ii) computer vision technology can be used to accurately and efficiently detect normal and abnormal kidney structures and quantify textural (i.e., the spatial relationship between pixel values) and morphological (i.e., shape, size) information from kidney tissue. We will test our central hypothesis that inherent in the complexity of the structural changes in the renal parenchyma is information predictive of underlying disease biology and clinical outcome. We will pursue this hypothesis (1) by testing the clinical and molecular relevance of automatic detection and quantification of known morphologic biomarkers of clinical outcomes and mechanisms and of groups of patients with similar DL-derived morphologic characteristics; (2) by extracting next-generation pathomic features from DL-derived morphologic parameters and by testing their associations—individually and combined into pathomic profiles—with clinical outcomes and gene expression; and (3) by building machine learning-based models that integrate computer vision-derived pathology data with gene expression and clinical data to predict individual patient clinical outcomes, and to assess the additive prediction value of each data domain. Finally, we will group patients using the biomarkers identified to be most predictive of clinical outcomes. Ultimately, our work will contribute to a foundation for the deployment of a comprehensive artificial intelligence-guided precision medicine program for FSGS/MCD, applying descriptive, predictive, and ultimately prescriptive analytics as support tools for practicing pathologists and nephrologists. Project Narrative The computer vision technologies and machine learning methods applied in this grant will facilitate a precision medicine approach for nephrotic syndrome patients through automated histologic assessment of renal biopsies and comprehensive characterization of kidney structure, function, and molecular endophenotypes. The computational pathology framework and understanding of biology and disease trajectory will serve as a support tool to guide pathologists and nephrologists in kidney research, clinical trials, and clinical care for proteinuric glomerulonephropathies.",Computational Pathology of Proteinuric Diseases,10297321,R01DK118431,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Minority People ', ' Minority Population ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nephrotic Syndrome ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' prognostic ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Renal glomerular disease ', ' Glomerular disease ', ' Renal Glomerular Diseases and Syndromes ', ' Renal glomerular disease or syndrome ', ' Renal glomerular disorder ', ' Renal glomerular syndrome ', ' Collaborations ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' FSGS ', ' Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ', ' Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' disease natural history ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' digital ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' endophenotype ', ' spatial relationship ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' support tools ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' machine vision ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal biopsy ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' biomarker signature ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' ']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,654731
"Data-Driven Learning Framework for Fast Quantitative Knee Joint Mapping PROJECT SUMMARY Osteoarthritis (OA), a leading cause of chronic disability in the elderly population, occurs with the degradation of the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage, mainly composed of proteoglycan, collagen fibers, and water. Early diagnosis of cartilage degeneration requires the detection of changes in proteoglycan concentration and collagen integrity, preferably non-invasively and before any morphological changes occur. Spin-spin relaxation time (T2) and spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (T1ρ) can provide quantitative information about the structure and biochemical composition of the cartilage before morphological changes occur. Mono-exponential (ME) models can characterize the T2 and T1ρ relaxation processes and map it for articular cartilage in the knee joint. A recent meta-analysis showed that T1ρ provides more discrimination than T2 for OA. However, the ME model alone cannot provide distinct information from different compartments of the cartilage. Recent studies have shown that T1ρ relaxation might have bi-exponential (BE) components, following the hypothesis of the multi- compartmental structure of the cartilage. BE T2 relaxation has shown better diagnostic performance than ME for OA and can show the dispersion of the relaxation times, reflecting the heterogeneity in the macromolecular environment of water in the cartilage. BE analysis of cartilage typically requires a larger number of acquisitions with different spin-lock times (TSLs) or echo times (TEs), resulting in long scan time. High spatial resolution is also needed to visualize the thin and curved cartilage and fine structures in the knee joint. As a result, in vivo application of BE three-dimensional (3D) T1ρ and T2 mapping techniques is still very limited. Compressed sensing (CS) combined with parallel imaging (PI) can accelerate acquisition and reduce the scan time required for ME 3D T1ρ and T2 mappings. T1ρ scans can be reduced from 30 min to ~3 min with an error smaller than 6.5%. However, the error is two to three times larger for BE mapping. This problem can be potentially solved by optimizing the sampling times (TSLs for T1ρ and TEs for T2) and the free parameters of the CS approach (k- space sampling pattern, regularization function, regularization parameter, and minimization algorithm parameters) using fully sampled 3D knee joint datasets, supported by machine learning tools. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop, optimize, and translate a high-spatial-resolution, rapid 3D magnetic resonance imaging sequence using data-driven learning-based CS for assessment of the human knee joint and using ME and BE 3D T1ρ (T2) mapping for improved biochemical characterization of cartilage and menisci on a standard clinical 3T scanner. PROJECT NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis of the knee is a leading cause of disability in elderly people, and no curative treatments exist. Early detection of osteoarthritis might help delay or prevent the onset of disability later in life. We propose a rapid and robust approach for the quantitative multi-compartment assessment of knee cartilage without using either exogenous contrast agent or hardware modifications as an early screening tool for osteoarthritis.",Data-Driven Learning Framework for Fast Quantitative Knee Joint Mapping,10296235,R01AR078308,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' articular cartilage ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Collagen ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Knee ', ' Knee joint ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Proteoglycan ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' macromolecule ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Biochemical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Meniscus ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' disability ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' knee OA ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' water environment ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Extracellular Matrix Degradation ', ' Slice ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' healing ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' Population ', ' cartilage degradation ', ' cartilage degeneration ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' curative treatments ', ' curative intervention ', ' curative therapeutic ', ' curative therapy ', ' early screening ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,531779
"Uncover Spatial-Constraint Related Morphome Using Tissue-on-a-Chip Platform and Data-Driven Mathematical Modeling PROJECT SUMMARY Cell behaviors and tissue developments often occur under spatial constraints (e.g., interstitial space, tissue lining, skull enclosure). The current in vitro systems are often open cultures, and thus miss the spatial constraints and other in vivo stimuli. The current in vivo models are often low throughput and hard-to-trace, therefore unable to unravel the complex interplay between intrinsic influences (e.g., genetics/epigenetics) and extrinsic ones (e.g., micro-environment). For example, cell membrane blebbing and brain folding are fundamental and impactful bio-behaviors under spatial constraints. Their biophysical and molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Lately, several experimental and theoretical tools have emerged to fascinate the modeling of complex bio-behaviors. This proposed study aims to parameterize morphological information, relate to the complex influences under spatial constraints, and unravel the mechanism of bio- behaviors in the two exemplified areas. It will be done through a morphome platform that integrates several experimental-theoretical tools (e.g., tissue-on-a-chip, data-driven modeling, machine-learning), which has been pre-defined by PI and Co-Is. We hope to 1) fill the compelling gaps in our understanding of membrane blebbing and brain folding process and 2) establish an effective strategy to uncover a broad range of basic biological processes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many biological behaviors and functions are realized through the formation and changes of the shapes of biological systems. However, the mechanism of how some biological shapes are determined and changed in a limited body space remains unknown. How these shape-changes direct biological behaviors are also poorly understood.

"Computational methods to predict gene regulatory network dynamics and cell state transitions Project Summary The goal of this research program is to provide tools for the discovery of transcriptional networks that control cell fate decisions. Cell fate decisions driven by cell state transitions underlie essential cell processes from development to cellular reprogramming. There is an opportunity to make use of publicly available genomic data to develop predictive computational models of cell state transition dynamics. The methods proposed will offer means to gain insight into cell fate decision-making and how it is transcriptionally regulated, given specific cell fate decision points and suitable data. Examples of such decision points include control of epidermal regeneration, or the maintenance of balance among myeloid cell fates during hematopoiesis. In order to bridge the gap between genomics and cell dynamics, statistical and computational modeling challenges must be overcome. Two key challenges form the basis of this research program: 1) developing statistical methods to infer regulatory networks while accounting for the levels of variability between single cells, and 2) developing computational models to couple gene regulatory dynamics within cells and cell-cell communication between cells. To address the first challenge, we will develop machine learning models to predict gene expression dynamics from time-series data. These models will be able to classify genes by their temporal patterns, and the results will inform gene network inference. We will then develop methods for network inference that integrate muti-modal data (single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing) as well as cell-cell signaling information to learn networks that control specific cell state transitions. To address the second challenge, we will develop differential equation-based multiscale models of the gene regulatory network dynamics coupled with the cell- external signaling dynamics. This will allow us to capture both molecular and cellular dynamics in high resolution, and thus identify which parameters exert key control over the system. We will use Bayesian methods for parameter inference to fit models to data and perform model selection, adapting methods where needed for multiscale model inference. Models will be rigorously evaluated through their application to specific systems, including cell differentiation (e.g. myeloid fate decisions during hematopoiesis) and development (e.g. nephron progenitor cell fate decisions). In each of these organ systems, models predictions will be tested experimentally via collaborations. Following iterative testing, open-source, validated methods will be made widely available for the study of the dynamic processes of cell fate decision-making. Project Narrative Cell fate decisions are essential for development and the maintenance of organs throughout life, thus understanding them underlies health challenges ranging from developmental disorders to cancer. This project will develop computational methods using genomic data to study the dynamic gene expression programs that control cell fate decisions.

"Genomic Insights into Human Population Mixture and its Role in Adaptation and Disease Project Summary  Recent studies have shown that population mixture (or `admixture') is pervasive throughout human evolution and has played a major role in shaping human genetic and phenotypic variation. Despite the ubiquity and importance of population mixture, we still lack adequate methods to characterize the impact of admixture on a genomic scale and leverage this information for effective gene mapping. Addressing these topics is the central focus of research in my lab. In this proposal, our goal is to develop new methods to reconstruct fine-scale genomic ancestry in admixed groups and leverage this information to identify novel disease and adaptive mutations and genes. The application of these methods to large genomic surveys will help to discover novel disease and adaptive variants.  The first step in characterizing the genomic impact of admixture is to infer the ancestry of each chromosomal segment, referred to as local ancestry. Towards this goal, we are developing new methods for local ancestry inference using machine-learning approaches that are ideally suited for classification problems and computationally tractable for large datasets. Our preliminary results show that our method is highly accurate and applicable across a range of demographic models. With reliable local ancestry inference, we will be well placed to study the impact of admixture on disease architecture and evolution of complex traits. We propose to use Admixture Mapping, a method to identify disease associations by leveraging ancestry differences across the genome, between cases and controls or among cases alone. By applying Admixture Mapping to complex admixed groups like South Asians and Latinxs, we aim to discover new population- specific disease associations and advance our understanding of disease architecture. Further, we will develop a novel method to leverage the demographic history of admixed groups to identify adaptive variants. By applying the method to study selection at various timescales in human evolution, we will uncover candidate genes and pathways related to adaptive gene flow and characterize its role in shaping human genetic variation. Finally, we will build reference-free ancestral genomes by recovering chromosomal segments of our lost ancestors hidden in admixed genomes. We will use these genomes to reconstruct the demographic history of our ancestors, as well as understand the fitness effects of population mixtures and the phenotypic legacy of our extinct ancestors.  The successful completion of the proposed project will provide new statistical tools to leverage patterns of admixture to perform effective disease mapping and evolutionary inference in diverse, admixed groups. Application of these methods to large-scale genomic datasets will provide insights into the genetic, evolutionary, and functional impact of admixture during human evolution. Algorithms proposed here will be implemented in freely available software for use by other researchers. Project Narrative Although population mixture or admixture is pervasive through human evolution, we still lack adequate statistical methods to study its functional and evolutionary impact. Our goal in this proposal is to develop a suite of computational methods to characterize the local genomic structure of admixed populations and use this information for a range of applications from gene mapping to reconstructing ancestral genomes. These tools will help to analyze data from admixed groups as efficiently as homogeneous populations, and provide novel insights into the genetic and phenotypic legacy of admixture in human evolution.",Genomic Insights into Human Population Mixture and its Role in Adaptation and Disease,10276371,R35GM142978,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' structural genomics ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' South Asian ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population ', ' admixture mapping ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' computational suite ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Latinx ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2021,376839
"Systematic Characterization of Small Nucleolar RNAs in Cancer Abstract Despite recent advancements in treatment options for cancer, a majority of cancer types continue to lack fully characterized and effective targeted therapies. This insufficiency has resulted in the demand for alternative, previously unconsidered treatment approaches to improve disease diagnostics, prognoses, and patient survival outcomes. Recently, we performed integrative analysis for small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs) in a large number of patient samples and identified 46 snoRNAs that exhibit broad-spectrum clinical significance with 12 or more types of cancer. We developed a data portal, snoRNA in cancers (SNORic), which allows researchers to explore the significance of individual snoRNAs in cancer. SNORic has been accessed >100,000 times since its release in 2017, suggesting its broad impact in the biomedical research community. We provided initial genetic evidence indicating that elevated expression of snoRNAs facilitated the tumorigenesis of mammary gland malignancies. Mechanistically we demonstrated that SNORD46 plays important roles in promoting the initiation, growth, invasion and progression of TNBC. Therefore, elucidation of the roles of snoRNAs in promoting tumorigenesis serves as the first step in the development of a novel class of snoRNA-based biomarkers and therapeutic targets.  Our central hypothesis is that snoRNAs serve as essential RNA targets in promoting cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance, which could be attenuated in vivo by an antisense oligonucleotide-based targeted therapy. In specific aim 1, we will delineate the diagnostic and prognostic values of these snoRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer (Aim 1.1). We will demonstrate the molecular mechanism that these snoRNAs promote TNBC cell proliferation, mobility and invasion (Aim 1.2). We will demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotide-based snoRNA targeted therapy effectively inhibits TNBC growth in vivo (Aim 1.3). We will evaluate and interpret causal effects through molQTL analysis (Aim 1.4). In specific aim 2, we will determine the role of three snoRNAs in breast cancer drug resistance (Aim 2.1). We will understand the molecular mechanisms for drug resistance through multi-omics data (Aim 2.2). To expand our perspective on drug resistance, we will predict the drug response from individual snoRNA expression with the augmentation of deep learning (Aim 2.3). We will study the drug responses effects among snoRNA-based subtypes (Aim 2.4). We will build a user-friendly data portal for releasing the date generated through integrative analysis (Aim 2.5). This study will significantly advance the prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic potential of snoRNAs; the absence of this research work will greatly hinder the realization of snoRNA-based therapeutic considerations for cancer patients. Project Narrative Despite improvements in clinical considerations for cancer, a considerable number of cancer subtypes continue to lack effective targeted therapies, resulting in the urgent need for the development of previously unconsidered treatment approaches and therapeutic strategies. Following the emergence of preliminary data implicating snoRNAs as key players in a significant number of cancer-related processes and signaling pathways, this project seeks to determine the functional effects of snoRNAs in vitro and in vivo, elucidate the drug response effects of snoRNAs, and provide a comprehensive data resource for exploring the biomedical significance of snoRNAs. The proposed study will shed light on future clinical considerations for the development of targeted therapies for cancer types currently lacking effective treatment options, and it is also expected that the computational methods and experimental systems established in the proposed research will be applicable to other cancer types, thereby greatly leveraging the impact of this project.",Systematic Characterization of Small Nucleolar RNAs in Cancer,10277525,R01CA262623,"['Biomedical Research ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' In Vitro ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Antisense Oligonucleotides ', ' Anti-Sense Oligonucleotides ', ' Antisense Agent ', ' anti-sense agent ', ' anti-sense oligo ', ' antisense oligo ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' prognostic ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Diagnostic ', ' System ', ' Heterograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' snoRNA ', ' Small Nucleolar RNA ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Mammary gland ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Data ', ' breast tumor cell ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' mammary carcinogenesis ', ' mammary oncogenesis ', ' Mammary Tumorigenesis ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' user-friendly ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' cancer initiation ', ' data portal ', ' data sharing portal ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted cancer therapy ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' Breast Cancer cell line ', ' Breast tumor cell line ', ' survival outcome ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' data resource ', ' drug response prediction ', ' Predict drug response ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' cancer drug resistance ', ' resistance to cancer drugs ', ' resistant to cancer drugs ', ' deep learning ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' refractory cancer ', ' resistant cancer ', ' mammary ', ' ']",NCI,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCE CTR,R01,2021,406018
"Proteomic Stable Isotope Probing as a Novel Approach for Linking Prebiotics with Active Gut Microbiota PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Characterization of the metabolic interactions between organisms is key to understanding the mechanisms of disease and symbioses between microbes and their animal hosts. Our long-term goal is to advance the applicability and accessibility of proteomic stable isotope probing (SIP) in ways that make it a valuable tool for microbiome researchers looking to measure in situ metabolic interactions of human microbiota. The objective of this proposal is to improve the performance and reproducibility of experimental measurements and accelerate the computational analysis of proteomic SIP experiments and to demonstrate the value of this method for studying the in vivo and in vitro metabolism of prebiotics by gut microbiota. Expected outcomes will represent a significant advance, because optimizing the use of prebiotics as therapeutics requires identification of the specific microorganisms capable of metabolizing prebiotics. By identifying proteins of specific taxa that are synthesized as a direct result of prebiotic assimilation, proteomic SIP will provide unambiguous links between prebiotic metabolism and the specific microorganisms responsible for this activity. We will accomplish this objective by pursuing three specific aims: 1) to increase the performance and reproducibility of mass spectrometry measurements by optimizing data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods for proteomic SIP; 2) to significantly accelerate the computing-intensive database search step by adapting the Sipros algorithm to use graphic processing units (GPUs) and cloud computing; and 3) to track in vivo and in vitro prebiotic assimilation patterns by microbial populations within simple consortia and complex natural communities. Our proposed work includes several innovations, such as the application of deep learning algorithms to improve the analysis mass spectrometry data, leveraging GPU-based parallel computing and cloud computing to accelerate the computational steps in the data analysis workflow, and using proteomic SIP for the first time to track prebiotic metabolism by gut microbes. The expected outcomes of the project include (a) a new DIA- based workflow for proteomic SIP that can identify significantly more labeled peptides at higher accuracy of enrichment estimation, (b) a new computational workflow that is faster to run, more scalable to large datasets, and more accessible to researchers, and (c) establish novel foundational knowledge on the specificity of prebiotic metabolism by microbes in the gut.

"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individuals’ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Clinical Engineering ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Health ', ' Influentials ', ' Iontophoresis ', ' Drug Iontophoresis ', ' iontophoresis therapy ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physiology ', ' Reading ', ' Sodium Chloride ', ' salt ', ' Sweat Glands ', ' sudiferous gland ', ' Technology ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' beta-Hydroxybutyrate ', ' 3 Hydroxybutyrate ', ' β-Hydroxybutyrate ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Individual ', ' dietary supplements ', ' diet supplement ', ' nutritional supplement ', ' Nutritional Support ', ' nutritional care ', ' nutritional therapy ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Nutritional status ', ' Sweat screening test ', ' sweat analysis ', ' Sweat test ', ' Hour ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Nutrient ', ' Study Subject ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Address ', ' Intake ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' cystic fibrosis patients ', ' CF patients ', ' individuals with CF ', ' individuals with cystic fibrosis ', ' patients with CF ', ' patients with cystic fibrosis ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' operation ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' microsensor ', ' Data Analytics ', ' targeted biomarker ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' remote patient monitoring ', ' precision nutrition ', ' individualized nutrition ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796
"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10172914,R44EY031202,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Color ', ' Counseling ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Ear ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fees ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incentives ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' New York ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optometry ', ' Optometries ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sales ', ' Savings ', ' Smoking ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Vitamins ', ' Specialist ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Java ', ' Pythons ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' Atrophic AMD ', ' Atrophic age-related macular degeneration ', ' Dry AMD ', ' Non-exudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' dry age-related macular degeneration ', ' Trademark ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Visit ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup ', ' checkup examination ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Speed ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Druse ', ' Drusen ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' solar exposure ', ' sun light exposure ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Supplementation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' prospective ', ' user-friendly ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' photobiomodulation ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' screening ', ' Learning Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' software as a service ', ' care costs ', ' Injections ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' sociodemographic factors ', ' socio-demographic factors ', ' remote screening ', ' ']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2021,531319
"Identifying treatment responders in medication trials for AUD using machine learning approaches ABSTRACT Alcohol use disorder (AUD), as defined in DSM-5, represents a highly prevalent, costly, and often untreated condition in the United States. Pharmacotherapy offers a promising avenue for treating AUD and for improving clinical outcomes for this debilitating disorder. While developing novel medications to treat AUD remains a high priority research area, there remain major opportunities to further elucidate clinical response in completed medication trials. To that end, a key question in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is which patients respond to a given pharmacotherapy. Identifying treatment responders provides major opportunities to advance clinical care for AUD by personalizing medication practices on the bases of variables/predictors of good clinical response. For example, while the effect size for medications such as naltrexone is deemed small-to-moderate, a host of studies over the past decade have shown that its effect size may be considerably larger for certain subgroups of patients. Towards advancing precision medicine for AUD and leveraging data from a host of carefully conducted RCTs for AUD, this R03 application seeks to conduct secondary data analysis. Specifically, we propose to analyze data from four RCTs conducted by the NIAAA Clinical Investigations Group (NCIG). These state-of-the-art RCTs for AUD have tested the following pharmacotherapies: (a) quetiapine, (b) Levetiracetam XR (Keppra XR®), (c) Varenicline (Chantix®), and (d) HORIZANT® (Gabapentin Enacarbil) Extended-Release. In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in the NCIG RCTs. Machine learning represents a highly promising and underutilized data analytic strategy in the field of AUD treatment response. Machine learning models prioritize the ability to predict future outcomes over creating perfectly fitting models for the data at hand. This results in models which are more generalizable to future observations, which fits well with our goal of identifying responders in RCTs. Leveraging data from these pivotal RCTs through secondary data analysis and using novel analytic methods, namely machine learning, provides a cost-effective approach to identifying AUD pharmacotherapy responders. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in pivotal clinical trials for AUD.

"Accelerated discovery of synthetic polymers for ribonucleoprotein delivery through the integration of active learning, machine learning, and polymer science PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Gene editing systems such as CRISPR/Cas9 have rapidly grown in popularity as research tools and hold the potential to cure a diverse set of genetic disorders. However, effective, safe, and effective delivery remains a significant challenge for therapeutic translation and for application to cell types that are difficult to culture ex vivo. Ideally, intact Cas9 protein would be delivered with its guide RNA (sgRNA) as a purified ribonucleoprotein (RNP), as opposed to Cas9-encoding mRNA or plasmids, to minimize off-target effects. Viral vectors (e.g., AAVs) cannot deliver such large cargo due to their limited capsid size, which exhibit additional challenges with respect to immunogenicity, cost, and manufacturability. Fortunately, synthetic polymers--widely studied in the context of nucleic acid delivery and as biomaterials--have recently shown promise as vehicles for in vivo delivery of sgRNA- Cas9 RNPs. However, there are no consistent design principles by which novel synthetic polymers with improved delivery efficiency, tissue specificity, and safety can be developed. There are far too many polymer structures to test exhaustively or through ad hoc experimentation, so a systematic approach to polymer design, synthesis, and evaluation is required to identify promising candidates. This proposal presents a framework for the discovery of functional polymers through Bayesian experimental design. Machine learning models trained on experimental outcomes will serve as surrogates for experimentation in order to virtually screen a massive library of potential polymer candidates. Polymer candidates will be selected algorithmically through Bayesian Optimization to balance exploration of unknown chemical space and exploitation of structures known to effectively deliver RNPs. Aim 1 will involve (a) the synthesis of a diverse library of biodegradable poly(ester urea amines) (PEUAs), (b) the evaluation of their functional performance using a model fluorescent reporter knock-in/knock-out assay, a cell viability assay, and a metabolic activity assay, and (c) the development and validation of a machine learning model to learn a quantitative relationship between polymer structure/composition and these multiple performance metrics. Aim 2 will involve (a) the enumeration of the chemical space of synthetically accessible PEUAs, and (b) the development and application of a Bayesian Optimization framework leveraging the machine learning model from Aim 1 to guide the selection of candidate polymers from the enumerated space through iterative rounds of experimentation. The outcome of the proposed work will be an integrated tool combining machine learning and polymer science for the unbiased exploration of a broad biomaterial design space, validated through the development of effective and safe RNP delivery vehicles for gene editing that outperform existing commercial polymeric vehicle solutions. NARRATIVE Gene editing is a powerful technology with the potential to cure a wide variety of genetic disorders, but methods for delivering gene editing systems into live cells exhibit significant limitations. The current proposal combines concepts in active learning, machine learning, and polymer science to discover new synthetic polymers with improved delivery performance. Such a platform will lead to safer, cheaper, and more effective delivery of gene therapies and will be broadly applicable to the discovery of polymers for other biomedical applications.","Accelerated discovery of synthetic polymers for ribonucleoprotein delivery through the integration of active learning, machine learning, and polymer science",10195432,R21GM141616,"['Algorithms ', ' Amines ', ' amine ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Capsid ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Esters ', ' Exhibits ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Lipids ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Plasmids ', ' Polymers ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' Ribonucleotides ', ' Ribonucleoside Phosphates ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Urea ', ' Carbamide ', ' Elaqua XX ', ' Urea Carbamide ', ' Ureaphil ', ' Work ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' exhaustion ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' biocompatibility ', ' biomaterial compatibility ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' polypeptide ', ' chemical informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Polymer Chemistry ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Gene Delivery ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' immunogenicity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' manufacturing process ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' candidate selection ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' Knock-in ', ' knockin ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' manufacturability ', ' nucleic acid delivery ', ' in silico ', ' virtual screening ', ' virtual screenings ', ' RNA delivery ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2021,197622
"Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution Project Summary A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of brain cells and their brain-wide organization is essential for interrogating human brain function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward mapping brain cells through various lenses, which have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, integrative extraction of the multimodal properties of various cell-types brain-wide within the same brain, crucial to elucidating complex intercellular relationships, remains nearly impossible. We have developed high-throughput, cost-effective technology platforms to create a fully integrated three-dimensional (3D) human brain cell atlas by simultaneously mapping high-dimensional features (e.g., spatial, molecular, morphological, and microenvironment information) of all cells acquired from the same whole brain. The proposed work will establish the most comprehensive 3D human brain map to date, with unprecedented resolution and completeness. We envision that this atlas will facilitate the integration of a broad range of studies and allow the research community to interrogate human brain structure and function at multiple levels. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel technology to transform whole human brain tissue into indestructible hydrogel–tissue hybrids that allow highly multiplexed molecular labeling and subcellular-resolution volume imaging. In Aim 2, we will apply scalable labeling and imaging technologies to map the brain-wide 3D distribution of various cell-type and structural markers at subcellular resolution within the same brain. Our chemical engineering–based approach to this aim will enable cost-effective, lossless 3D labeling of the entire human brain at lower cost as traditional subsampling approaches. True volume labeling and subcellular-resolution imaging will allow us to extract fine morphological and connectivity information from labeled cells and reconstruct the microenvironment of all cells. In Aim 3, we will use a host of rapid and highly automated algorithms to perform unbiased, integrative high- dimensional phenotyping of all cells based on their spatial location, molecular expression, morphology, and microenvironment. In Aim 4, we will perform super-resolution phenotyping of cells in a selected brain region from the same sample used in Aim 3 to map inter-areal axonal connectivity at single-fiber resolution and to characterize chemical synapses. This integrative approach will likely unveil unique cell-types and brain regions, a crucial step toward a better understanding of brain function. The complete 3D dataset will be linked to magnetic resonance and diffusion spectrum images and existing reference atlases to facilitate the integration of a wide breadth of study at multiple levels and to make the data publicly accessible for mining and analysis. A detailed picture of the human brain’s complex intermolecular, intercellular, and interareal interactions is of paramount importance for understanding its function and dysfunction. However, the immense complexity of the human brain and the absence of enabling technologies have hither-to made it impossible to interrogate these interactions brain-wide.

Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,10149422,R01NS107328,"['Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Bilateral ', ' Disease Progression ', ' uptake ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' expectation ', ' Modeling ', ' model design ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' presynaptic ', ' progression marker ', ' progression biomarker ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', "" Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale "", ' MDS-UPDRS ', "" MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale "", ' UPDRS ', "" Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale "", ' Algorithms ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Goals ', ' Joints ', ' Handedness ', ' Laterality ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' putamen ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Systems Theory ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' dopamine transporter ', ' DAT dopamine transporter ', ' Glean ', ' ']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352779
"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation. Leveraging our open source SimVascular project, the proposed project will enable rapid expansion of the existing Vascular Model Repository while ensuring model credibility and reproducibility to foster innovation in clinical and basic science cardiovascular research.",Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository,10175029,R01LM013120,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incentives ', ' Joints ', ' Laws ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Cardiovascular Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Blood flow ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' respiratory ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' supercomputer ', ' treatment planning ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Source Code ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' shape analysis ', ' shape description ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' open source ', ' stem ', ' clinical care ', ' data format ', ' Patient risk ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' online repository ', ' on-line archive ', ' on-line repository ', ' online archive ', ' web repository ', ' web-based repository ', ' gigabyte ', ' data resource ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' automated analysis ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' data curation ', ' trustworthiness ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,330299
"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",10159285,R01GM136859,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Crowding ', ' Drug Design ', ' Environment ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Isotopes ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Proteins ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Specialist ', ' HMQC ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Biochemical ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Pyruvate ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Side ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Nuclear ', ' methyl group ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' nuclear power ', ' COSY ', ' TOCSY ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Resolution ', ' Therapeutic Studies ', ' Therapy Research ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Scheme ', ' protein function ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' control theory ', ' nonlinear regression ', ' non-linear regression ', ' Structural Protein ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,445749
"VISUALIZATION OF SUBCELLULAR DYNAMICS IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS Abstract Contemporary fluorescence microscopy connects our understanding of molecular events from biochemistry and structural biology with their activities in living cells. Lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM) has made it possible for us to track phenomena such as endocytic vesicle assembly or lipid kinase recruitment across an entire cell with high resolution, in both space and time, and with nearly single-molecule sensitivity. Development during the past year of lattice light sheet microscopy with adaptive optics (AO-LLSM) has overcome the optical limitations that have so far restricted most studies to individual cells in culture, allowing us to achieve comparable resolution and sensitivity in the complex optical environment of an intact, living, multicellular organism. It promises to bridge the gap between cells and organisms, through high sensitivity, volumetric imaging, with diffraction-limited resolution, of living tissues and developing embryos. We propose a research program in three overlapping stages: implementation of AO-LLSM (in collaboration with its developer), development of the new kinds of visualization and analysis software required by the scale and complexity of the datasets, and use of AO-LLSM to solve a problem in vertebrate development. To meet the computational challenges of analyzing the 4D data sets (from low signal-to-noise, the often non- punctate characteristics of the objects being studied, the temporally varying spatial complexity of the data, and the size of the data sets), we will develop new approaches using deep learning and related algorithms, with consultation from experts. As a paradigm application, we will study the consequences of Notch signaling and the related membrane-traffic and protein translocation events for cell differentiation in zebrafish early neurogenesis. AO-LLSM will for the first time allow us to relate molecular signaling events occurring on a timescale of seconds at cell interfaces to the ultimate fate of daughter cells many hours later. We therefore expect that in the course of resolving some long- standing issues in cell fate determination, we will develop microscopy approaches and computer visualization tools that are widely applicable to a range of model systems and biological questions. Narrative We will implement and apply a novel, live-cell imaging strategy (Lattice Light-Sheet Microscopy with Adaptive Optics: AO-LLSM) that spans, with diffraction-limited resolution, a range from molecules to tissues and from seconds to hours. We will use this new technology to study cell differentiation in the embryonic zebrafish brain, concentrating on how Notch-mediated signaling exerts long-range control over neuronal development. Obtaining accurate and comprehensive models of the underlying biology will require that we devise new and generalizable ways to display and analyze complex data sets, while overcoming the computational challenges posed by the low SNR of the imaging regime, the time-varying spatial complexity of the data, and the size of the data sets.",VISUALIZATION OF SUBCELLULAR DYNAMICS IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS,10136020,R35GM130386,"['Algorithms ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computers ', ' Consultations ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Environment ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lipids ', ' Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Light Microscopy ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' notch protein ', ' notch ', ' notch receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' structural biology ', ' Transmembrane Protein Transport ', ' Protein translocation ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' neurogenesis ', ' Modeling ', ' single molecule ', ' Endocytotic Vesicle ', ' Endocytic Vesicle ', ' Membrane Traffic ', ' Membrane Protein Traffic ', ' Resolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' neuron development ', ' neuronal development ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' daughter cell ', ' adaptive optics ', ' live cell imaging ', ' live cell image ', ' live cellular image ', ' live cellular imaging ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' Visualization ', ' complex data ', ' data complexity ', ' ']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R35,2021,442500
"A novel method for volumetric oxygen mapping in living retina PROJECT SUMMARY It is widely accepted that oxygen deficiency is a culprit and a marker of several major retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma etc. However, it remains to be extremely challenging to measure oxygen in vivo in the eye, and no tools currently exist that can provide 3D oxygen distributions in the retina with high spatial resolution at appropriate imaging speeds. The goal of this project is to overcome these limitations and develop a new optical imaging technique for volumetric oxygen mapping in retina. Our approach will leverage the recently developed potent oxygen probes (such as Oxyphor 2P), whose phosphorescence decay times serve as quantitative markers of local oxygen partial pressures (pO2) in living tissues. To enable volumetric imaging with high throughput, we propose to develop a novel imaging instrument, termed oblique scanning laser ophthalmoscope (oSLO). oSLO is based on the concept of single lens scanned light sheet microscopy and enables volumetric phosphorescence lifetime imaging without time- consuming plane-by-plane pixel-wise sectioning. Our new method should be able to achieve 10 kilohertz voxel rate that is three orders of magnitude higher than the current state-of-the-art two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM). In this project we will: (Aim 1) develop a phosphorescence lifetime-based oSLO for volumetric pO2 mapping in living retina in mouse. The new design will allow parallel detection of signals at depth from each scanned location, so that the need in conventional depth sectioning is eliminated and imaging throughput is greatly increased. We will (Aim 2) dynamically image responses of retina and choroid to systemic hypoxia challenge using Oxyphor 2P. We will (Aim 3) then bridge oSLO measurements and label-free applications by multimodal imaging with visible light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT). Using vascular pO2 as the ground-truth, we will develop a deep spectral training (DSL) algorithm to supervise the inverse calculation of vis-OCT for robust and reliable label-free retinal oximetry. This study will enable the first direct quantitative imaging of interactions between the two circulatory systems in retina (i.e. retinal and choroidal circulation), providing unprecedented information about retinal oxygen supply. IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH: Successful completion of this program will deliver a new ground-breaking methodology for mapping oxygen in the retina that will greatly improve our understanding of retinal diseases. NARRATIVE Oxygen is essential in the retina, and the deficiency of oxygen is a culprit in a broad spectrum of retinal diseases. However, it remains challenging to measure oxygen in vivo in the eye. This multidisciplinary proposal is to develop a disruptive imaging method to provide unprecedented volumetric oxygen mapping in living mouse retina, as well as a deep learning method, to translate our oxygen measurements into label-free retinal oximetry for future clinical applications.",A novel method for volumetric oxygen mapping in living retina,10098478,R01EY032163,"['Affect ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Choroid ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nobel Prize ', ' Ophthalmoscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Partial Pressure ', ' Pathology ', ' phosphorescence ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Fluorescence Angiography ', ' Mediating ', ' Photons ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Ophthalmoscopes ', ' Funduscopes ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Measurement ', ' Cell Respiration ', ' Cellular Respiration ', ' aerobic metabolism ', ' aerobic respiration ', ' oxidative metabolism ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Vascular System ', ' Oximetry ', ' Oxygen saturation measurement ', ' American ', ' retina circulation ', ' success ', ' choroidal circulation ', ' porphyrin a ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Fundus ', ' response ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Pathologic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' adaptive optics ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' human imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' novel imaging technique ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' two photon microscopy ', ' 2-photon microscopy ', ' two photon excitation microscopy ', ' algorithm training ', ' ']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,552744
"Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes a training program to integrate the PI, Dr. Varadan's previous research efforts in informatics and machine learning into investigations pertaining to the etiology and progression of Barrett's Esophagus, a gastrointestinal disorder of significant public health interest. Much of Dr. Varadan's previous research has involved developing intelligent algorithms and informatics approaches to decode the interconnections within complex biological systems, with only a basic understanding of the clinical needs and complexities involved in translational research. The proposed project would provide a broad and in-depth mentored experience focused on clinical and biological aspects of Barrett's Esophagus, as well as added knowledge in the use of preclinical model systems to investigate biological mechanisms. The overall goal is to expand the PI's experience and training in the design and conduct of translational studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This objective will be achieved through a combination of didactic and research activities conducted under an exceptional mentoring team of translational researchers at Case Western Reserve University, spanning achievements across clinical management of GI disorders, molecular genetics and inflammatory processes associated with diseases of the gut. Accordingly, this proposal leverages Dr. Varadan's computational background to address an urgent and unmet need within the biomedical research community to develop reliable analytic approaches that can quantify signaling network activities in individual biological samples by integrating multi-omics measurements. We recently conceived a systems biology computational framework, InFlo, which integrates molecular profiling data to decode the functional states of cellular/molecular processes underpinning complex human diseases. Barrett's esophagus is one such complex disease gaining increasing importance to public health, as it is the known precursor to the deadly cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that the mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus remain elusive, a major objective of this proposal is to employ the InFlo framework combined molecular profiles derived from primary tissue cohorts, in vitro and in vivo model systems to establish the molecular roadmap of BE pathogenesis and disease recurrence, thus elucidating unifying mechanisms underlying this disease. This systems biology approach would enable the development of evidence-based, diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus and inform preventive strategies within at-risk populations. Project Narrative This proposal details a novel systems biology approach to enable seamless integration of patient molecular data to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex human diseases.

"Unlocking sequence-structure-function-disease relationships in large protein super-families Project Summary Predicting disease phenotypes from genotypes is a grand challenge in biology and personalized medicine. Our long-term goal is to address this challenge using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Working towards this goal, we have developed and deployed a powerful evolutionary systems approach to map the complex relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in biomedically important protein super-families such as protein kinases. We have made important contributions describing the unique modes of allosteric regulation in various protein kinases, deciphering the structural basis of oncogenic activation in a subset of receptor tyrosine kinases, uncovering the regulation of pseudokinases, and developing new tools and resources for addressing data integration challenges in the signaling field. We propose to build on these impactful studies to answer key questions emanating from our ongoing studies such as: What are the functions of pseudokinases, the catalytically-inert members of the kinome, and how can we use pseudokinases to better predict and characterize non-catalytic functions of kinases? What are the functions of conserved cysteine residues in regulatory sites of protein and small molecule kinases and are they post-translationally modified in redox signaling and oxidative stress response that are causally associated with age-related disorders? How can we enhance existing computational models for predicting genome-phenome relationships using structural information, and can machine learning on structurally enhanced knowledge graphs reveal new relationships between patient-derived mutations and disease phenotypes? We propose to answer these questions using a variety of approaches including statistical mining of large sequence datasets, molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis and in vivo assays. Completion of this work is expected to reveal new allosteric sites for targeting pseudokinase and kinase non-catalytic functions in diseases, and significantly advance our understanding of kinase regulatory mechanisms in disease and normal states. Our work will create new tools and resources for knowledge graph mining and provide explainable models for inferring causal relationships linking genomes and phenomes with potential applications in personalized medicine. Finally, the scope and impact of our work will be significantly broadened by participation in studies extending our specialized tools and technological approaches developed for the study of kinases to other biomedically important gene families such as glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases. Project Narrative Many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders are causally associated with abnormal protein kinase and glycosyltransferase functions. By characterizing the regulatory functions of these proteins in disease and normal states and by developing new tools to predict disease phenotypes from genotypes, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of these proteins for drug discovery and personalized medicine.",Unlocking sequence-structure-function-disease relationships in large protein super-families,10086608,R35GM139656,"['Allosteric Regulation ', ' Allosteric Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cysteine ', ' Half-Cystine ', ' L-Cysteine ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Maps ', ' Mining ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Patients ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' Kinase Family Gene ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' sulfotransferase ', ' Work ', ' glycosyltransferase ', ' EC 2.4 ', ' Glycoside Transferases ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Site ', ' Biochemical ', ' Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' PTK Receptors ', ' Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Gene ', ' Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Linked Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Receptors ', ' Link ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' in vivo ', ' Gene Family ', ' protein function ', ' disease phenotype ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' data integration ', ' Oncogenic ', ' human disease ', ' phenome ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' broadening participation research ', ' Broadening Participation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' knowledge graph ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R35,2021,357769

As a “Contemporary Concepts  5 in Toxicology” meeting, this workshop has the full backing, including being financially  6 underwritten, by the Society of Toxicology.  7 Computational modeling is an important tool for assessing the safety and use of  8 chemicals across many industries, including chemical, pharmaceutical, and consumer products.  9 Moreover, in silico methodologies offer academia and regulatory a fast and cheap method of 10 prioritizing its efforts to maintain compliance and safety in the market and environment. 11 This conference is designed to promote the development of actionable insights and 12 methodologies for increasing the biological relevance of in silico solutions. Specifically, this 13 conference will focus on solving the “black box effect”. There are many ways to validate a 14 model’s accuracy and domain – however if the model cannot explain what is happening 15 biologically, its use is severely diminished. This workshop will bring together regulatory, 16 academia, industry, and service providers to discuss current solutions and efforts, as well as 17 ongoing and future research. One goal of this conference will be to develop a roadmap for the 18 incorporation of AOPs (and similar biological reasonings) for computational tools. 19 This workshop has great appeal for multiple stakeholders within toxicology, namely 20 industry, academia, regulators, as well as service providers. The use of machine-learning to 21 replace laboratory toxicological tests is paramount to the future of the industry (3Rs). The use 22 of in silico models are explicitly referenced by NICEATM’s U.S. Strategic Roadmap, as well as 23 TSCA.

"Using Deep Learning to Predict Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) Differentiation Outcomes ABSTRACT Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) provide transformative new avenues to combat heart diseases. They have been used extensively to model disease mechanisms and predict drug responses. Despite significant advancements in iPSC-CMs differentiation, differentiation outcomes still vary across batches, cell lines, and protocols, resulting in significant experimental variability. As a result, characterizing differentiation outcomes is essential. The current standards to characterize iPSC-CM differentiation outcomes involve monitoring for functional or genetic attributes of cardiomyocytes during the differentiation. However these processes are prohibitively time consuming, imprecise, or expensive. Discovering earlier time points and scalable, accurate markers that can determine differentiation outcomes is critical for eliminating a severe bottleneck in cardiomyocyte differentiation and creating better iPSC-CM materials. Given the rising importance of iPSC-CMs in cardiovascular research, advances in iPSC-CM differentiation would widely accelerate the search for cures. Here, I propose leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), deep learning and computer vision to develop scalable, accurate methods for characterizing and predicting iPSC-CM differentiation outcomes. To achieve this, I will first use deep learning models to identify markers and time points that can be used to predict and determine differentiation outcomes. I have differentiated iPSC-CMs and obtained a dataset of images at each day of differentiation that are labeled with their final differentiation outcome. I will analyze the dataset using a deep learning model—an image classifier—to determine the earliest time point that can be used to predict differentiation outcomes. I will then correlate results with transcriptomic data to gain mechanistic insight. To evaluate whether deep learning methods are scalable and accurate models for predicting differentiation outcomes, I will differentiate genetically diverse iPSCs lines to create an additional dataset to fine tune the model and then evaluate the model’s potential for scalability. To validate the accuracy of the model, I will first verify that the model’s predictions align with conventional functional and genetic markers of differentiated cardiomyocytes. Then, I will functionally, morphologically, and genetically compare predictions made by the model against existing methods for evaluating differentiating outcomes. Completion of this proposal will eliminate a main bottleneck in iPSC-CM differentiation; create an extensive iPSC- CM differentiation ‘morphology atlas’; and accelerate the application of AI and deep learning to iPSC-CMs. Additionally, the outlined training will provide me with the computational and regenerative medicine expertise required to later succeed as an independent investigator and physician scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Characterization of induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) differentiation outcomes is currently prohibitively time intensive, imprecise, and expensive. The proposed studies will leverage Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision to build a label free method to characterize and predict iPSC- CM differentiation outcomes. Completion of these studies will eliminate a main bottleneck in iPSC-CM differentiation, create a morphological atlas of the differentiation process, and accelerate the application of deep learning to the field of iPSC-CMs, all of which will result in advancements in cardiovascular research.",Using Deep Learning to Predict Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) Differentiation Outcomes,10144653,F30HL156478,"['Differentiation Antigens ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atlases ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Time ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modeling ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' transcriptomics ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' combat ', ' contrast imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' drug response prediction ', ' Predict drug response ', ' cardiac tissue engineering ', ' engineered heart tissue ', ' deep learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,37994
"Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning Project Summary Positron-emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that allows clinicians and researchers to study the physiological or pathological processes of the human body, and in particular the brain via the use of specific tracers. For brain PET imaging, patient head movement during scanning presents a challenge for accurate PET image reconstruction and subsequent quantitative analysis. Problems due to head motion are exacerbated by the long duration of the scans, with scan times commonly over one hour. Furthermore, some PET studies specifically involve subjects that either have trouble staying still due to psychological variations, e.g. patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, or psychological variations, e.g. subjects with anxiety disorders, or are required to participate in tasks that involve movement, e.g. smoking cigarettes while scanning. In brain scans, the average head motion can vary from 7 mm in clinical scans to triple this amount for longer research scans. Quantitatively, a 5 mm head motion can produce biases of up to ~35% in regional intensities and ∼15% in volume of distribution estimates, which could much larger than the difference observed in regional intensities or binding potential that distinguish different demographic groups being studied. The ability to track and correct head motion, therefore, would be of high utility in both clinical and research PET studies. In the past, many motion correction methods have been proposed. However, except for hardware-based approaches, there has been no method that can track frequent head motion on-the-fly during the PET acquisition. Hardware-based approaches are not readily available for clinical translation or used by other research facilities due to highly-customized software/hardware setup. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a data-driven methodology using deep learning to track and estimate rigid head motion using PET raw data, and incorporate both tracer type and time as conditional variables into this deep neural network design in order to handle diverse PET tracer types and their dynamic behavior. Overall, these solutions will provide for a data-driven motion estimation methodology to improve the quality of PET imaging. Specifically, we will start with the development and testing of our methodology for rigid head motion estimation using single-tracer PET raw data. Then we will perform evaluation of our multi-tracer motion estimation methodology applied to real PET data with a diverse range of tracers. Finally, in the exploratory phase, we will integrate time-of-flight information into deep learning-based motion prediction. The significance of this proposal is that it will allow for improved quality of PET imaging in real time and potentially allow for its use in clinical PET systems that do not have special motion tracking hardware. This work will serve as a first step towards developing data-driven motion estimation algorithms for full body PET imaging. The innovation lies in the development of what is a data-driven solution to the problem of real time motion estimation. Project Narrative Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain is a highly useful tool for biomedical research and clinical practice. Head motion during scanning degrades PET image quality and introduces image artifacts. We propose to develop new data-driven methods, based on PET raw data, to estimate head motion using deep learning, which can be used for real time motion estimation in PET imaging.",Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning,10144432,R21EB028954,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology) ', ' Conditional Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Effect Modifiers ', ' Moderator Variables ', ' Gold ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Smoking ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Head Movements ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' Brain scan ', ' Performance ', ' research facility ', ' Cigarette ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' 18-FDG ', ' 18F- FDG ', ' 18FDG ', ' 2 Fluoro 2 deoxy D glucose ', ' 2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Tracer ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' ']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,209375
"Merging machine learning and mechanistic models to improve prediction and inference in emerging epidemics PROJECT SUMMARY When an outbreak of an established or emerging infectious disease occurs we ask a standard set of questions that are critical to a lifesaving public health response: Where will future incidence occur? How many cases will there be? And where can we most effectively intervene? The proposed research is motivated by real world instances where answering these questions was critical to making practical public health decisions, and current methods came up short: from deciding if and where to build additional Ebola Treatment Units in the 2014-15 West African Ebola epidemic, to identifying priority districts where oral cholera vaccine should be used in the 2016-17 cholera outbreak in Yemen, to picking locations where sufficient cases might occur to selecting and prioritizing interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. Forecasts informing such decisions are typically generated either using an epidemic model that relies on knowledge of the disease transmission mechanism and epidemic theory or using a statistical model to project the expected number of cases based on the relationship between covariates and observed counts. However, both approaches are subject to limitations, particularly early in an epidemic when few cases are observed. This project is based on the overarching scientific premise that inferences that combine the strengths of mechanistic epidemic models and statistical covariate models will substantially outperform either approach alone in forecasting and making decisions to confront emerging infectious disease threats. Specifically, this project aims to (1) Develop a framework to forecast incidence in ongoing outbreaks that merges mechanistic and machine learning approaches; (2) Validate the framework using retrospective data and apply the framework to inform decision making in emerging epidemics; (3) Integrate this inferential forecasting framework into causal decision theory to optimize critical actions in the public health response to emerging epidemics; and (4) Develop accessible and extensible tools for forecasting and decision analysis in infectious disease epidemics. We will validate these approaches using rigorous simulation studies and by applying the proposed approaches to retrospective data from important recent epidemics (e.g., Ebola, Cholera and COVID-19, as mentioned above). We will prospectively apply our approach to inform the response to emerging disease threats that occur during the project period, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure that the tools developed are useful, efficient, and user friendly, we will work with international humanitarian organizations responding to epidemics. Successful completion of these aims will provide a flexible and validated framework for forecasting and decision making during ongoing epidemics, while allowing for innovation in mechanistic and statistical approaches. In doing so it will provide tools to optimize responses and reduce morbidity and mortality during public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of the proposed project is to improve inference, forecasting and decision making in response to emerging infectious diseases by developing a framework to integrate mechanistic and statistical approaches to epidemic modeling and causal inference. Approaches developed will be validated using simulations and retrospective data and applied prospectively to reduce morbidity and mortality in emerging public health crises.

"Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports ABSTRACT Automated biomedical image classification has seen enormous improvements in performance over recent years, particularly in radiology. However, the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved this remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. An increasingly accepted means of acquiring this data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image For example, take the following brain MRI report snippet:  There is evidence of left parietal encephalomalacia consistent with known history of prior stroke. Small  focal area of hemosiderin deposition along the lateral margins of the left lateral ventricle. Here, the associated MRI could be labeled for both Encephalomalacia and Hemosiderin. NLP methods to automatically label images in this way have been used to create several large image classification datasets However, as this example demonstrates, radiology reports often contain far more granular information than prior NLP methods attempted to extract. Both findings in the above example mention their anatomical location, which linguistically is referred to as a spatial grounding, as the location anchors the finding in a spatial reference. Further, the encephalomalacia finding is connected to the related diagnosis of stroke, while the hemosiderin finding provides a morphological description (small focal area). This granular information is important for image classification, as advanced deep learning methods are capable of utilizing highly granular structured data. This is logical, as for instance a lung tumor has a slightly different presentation than a liver tumor. If an ML algorithm can leverage both the coarse information (the general presentation of a tumor) while also recognizing the subtle granular differences, it can find an optimal balance between specificity and generalizability. From an imaging perspective, this can also be seen as a middle ground between image-level labels (which are cheap but require significant data for training—a typical dataset has thousands of images or more) and segmentation (which is expensive to obtain, but provides better training data—a typical dataset has 40 to 200 images), as the fine-grained spatial labels correspond to natural anatomical segments. Our fundamental hypothesis in this project is that if granular information can be extracted from radiology reports with NLP, this will improve downstream radiological image classification when training on a sufficiently large dataset. For radiology, the primary form of granularity is spatial (location, shape, orientation, etc.), so this will be the focus of our efforts. We further hypothesize that these NLP techniques will be generalizable to most types of radiology reports. For the purpose of this R21-scale project, however, we will focus on three distinct types of reports with different challenges: chest X-rays (one of the most-studied and largest-scale image classification types), extremity X-rays (which offer different findings than chest X-rays), and brain MRIs (which present a different image modality and the additional complexity of three dimensions). NARRATIVE This project is interested in developing natural language processing (NLP) methods for better understanding the spatial relationships described in the free text data within radiology reports found in electronic health record (EHR) systems. We will (i) develop an ontology, (ii) manually create a dataset for training NLP methods, (iii) develop automatic NLP methods compatible the ontology and corpus, and (iv) evaluate automatic image classification methods that use the output of the NLP system as image labels.",Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports,10116379,R21EB029575,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Encephalomalacia ', ' Cerebromalacia ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Goals ', ' Hemosiderin ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Liver neoplasms ', ' Hepatic Neoplasms ', ' hepatic neoplasia ', ' hepatic neoplasm ', ' hepatic tumor ', ' liver tumor ', ' Lung Neoplasms ', ' Lung Tumor ', ' Pulmonary Neoplasms ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Specificity ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' CXR ', ' chest X ray ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest radiography ', ' lung radiography ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' thorax radiography ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' lateral ventricle ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Parietal ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ontology ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' spatial relationship ', ' tumor ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' radiological imaging ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' Grain ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' structured data ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,195000
"Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract Shear Stress and Light-Field to Elucidate the Initiation of Cardiac Outflow Tract Biomechanical forces modulate cardiac morphogenesis, and mutations in mechano-sensitive signaling pathways result in congenital heart defects. During the previous funding cycle, our team custom-built a Light- Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) with sub-voxel resolution to enhance axial resolution needed to provide a large field-of-view. This laser optical system allowed for imaging pulsatile vs. oscillatory shear stress- mediated Notch signaling to initiate endocardial trabeculation. We demonstrated that spatial (/x) and temporal (/t) variations in shear stress modulates Notch-EphrinB2-Neureguilin-1 signaling in the endocardium to activate erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase (ErbB2) that promotes proliferation of trabeculation. By integrating LSFM, computation, and transgenic models, we further established that trabeculation dissipates intracardiac shear stress-generated kinetic energy; thus, mitigating ventricular remodeling. However, it remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced myocardial contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis. Thus, we seek to integrate light-sheet (Bessel-Gaussian beam arrays) with a new 2) light-field (microlens array). The former provides non-diffracting illumination, and the latter provides volumetric detection as a paradigm shift to image both myocardial contractility and intracardiac flow dynamics in the outflow tract (OFT). Our preliminary study reveals that shear-mediated Notch1b expression in the endocardium of OFT regulates endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT); however, the mechanotransduction causation whereby myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress reciprocally interact to form bicuspid valves and subsequent remodeling to multi-cuspid valves remains elusive. Thus, our hypothesis is that integration of the new light-field system with imaging computation enhances spatiotemporal resolution needed to decouple myocardial contraction from intracardiac flow dynamics that modulates Notch1b-EndoMT to mediate valve morphogenesis in the OFT. In Aim 1, we plan to integrate light-sheet with the new light-field system for 4-D volumetric imaging of valve formation in the OFT. Our goal is to capture myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress at one snapshot. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the interaction between intracardiac shear stress and myocardial contractility underlying valve morphogenesis. Our goal is to decouple hemodynamic shear from contractile forces that mediate Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. In Aim 3, we will determine the relative role of shear stress and contractility underlying Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. Our goal is to elucidate the relative role of contractility and intracardiac stress to transmit Notch1b- EndoMT signaling underlying bicuspid-valve formation. Overall, our team aims to establish the micro- environment in which intracardiac flow dynamics and myocardial contractility interact to modulate OFT valve formation, with clinical significance to aortic valvular disease. Project Narrative Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects, including aortic valves and the greater arteries, are estimated to cause approximately 30% of these congenital heart diseases, and they are treated with surgical correction and/or replacement. It remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced cardiac contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis, including aortic stenosis, bicuspid or tricuspid aortic valves. To understand the mechanotransduction causation downstream of blood flow and shear stress sensing, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to integrate advanced laser optics, imaging computation, and genetic models to decouple intracardiac flow dynamics from myocardial contractility that modulates Notch1b-mediated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) with translational implication to aortic valve disease.",Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract,10146767,R01HL129727,"['aortic valve ', ' Aortic Valve Stenosis ', ' Aortic Stenosis ', ' Arteries ', ' Bicuspid ', ' Bicuspid Tooth ', ' Premolar ', ' Premolar Tooth ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Cuspid ', ' Canine Tooth ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Endocardium ', ' Endothelium ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Light Microscopy ', ' Mitral Valve ', ' Bicuspid Valve ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Myocardial Contraction ', ' heart contraction ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' erbB-2 Receptor ', ' ErbB2 receptor ', ' Oncogene Protein HER-2 ', ' Proto-Oncogene Protein HER-2 ', ' erbB-2 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' neu Receptor ', ' notch protein ', ' notch ', ' notch receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' PTK Receptors ', ' Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Gene ', ' Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Linked Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Receptors ', ' Blood flow ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' ERBB2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER2 ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2/neu ', ' NEU Oncogene ', ' NEU protein ', ' Oncogene ErbB2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' herstatin ', ' neu Genes ', ' Funding ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Ventricle Remodeling ', ' Ventricular Cardiac Remodeling ', ' Ventricular Myocardial Remodeling ', ' myocardial remodeling ', ' Ventricular Remodeling ', ' Acetylcholine Receptor Inducing Activity ', ' Breast Cancer Cell Differentiation Factor P45 ', ' NDF Protein ', ' NRG1 Gene Product ', ' NRG1 Protein ', ' Sensory And Motor Neuron-Derived Factor ', ' Neuregulin 1 ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' response ', ' shear stress ', ' Aortic valvular disorders ', ' aortic valve defect ', ' aortic valve disease ', ' aortic valvular disease ', ' aortic valve disorder ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Defect ', ' Detection ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' Resolution ', ' Transgenic Model ', ' transgenic trait ', ' Myocardial ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' Coupled ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanosensing ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,459651
"Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency Project Abstract Haploinsufficiency plays a crucial role in Neurofibromatosis (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder impacting over 120,000 individuals in the United States. Current therapeutic approaches focus on specific components of NF1 signaling, for example inhibiting MEK signaling pathways in tumors, thus failing to address the broad range of signaling and symptoms associated with NF1. Given that NF1 is characterized by both autosomal dominance and haploinsufficiency (lack of normal protein), upregulating protein expression of the remaining wild-type NF1 allele has the ability to compensate for loss of function from the mutant allele, thus alleviating a broad range of NF1 symptoms and overall disease progression. Infixion proposes to build a luciferase reporting assay to evaluate NF1 expression against known drugs, including 50+ compounds, across six drug classes, already identified by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression. By confirming that these candidate drugs activate NF1 transcription, increase NF1 protein expression, and normalize Ras pathway signaling in NF1 +/- Schwann cells, and by further screening libraries of known drugs for increased NF1 expression, we propose a novel path of NF1 drug discovery that will impact a broad range of NF1 patients and symptoms, in a preventative manner, and without regard to the wide spectrum of NF1 genetic mutations. Research Background. Increasing NF1 expression via transfection reverses abnormal Ras activation resulting from NF1 loss (Wallis, et al. 2018). Transcriptional activation in other genetic conditions such as Willams-Beuren Syndrome, and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis compensates for haploinsufficiency (Giordano, et al. 2012). Lastly, overcoming haploinsufficiency in another autosomal dominant condition (Sim1 induced obesity; mouse model) was recently shown using a Crispr/dCas9 transcriptional activator (Ahituv, et al. 2019). Specific Aims. 1) Construct a luciferase reporter assay engineered into the endogenous NF1 gene of a well characterized, publically available, immortalized NF1 +/- Schwann cell line (Wallace et al. 2016; data published at Synapse.org). Validate assay using a viral transcription factor developed by Infixion using Crispr/dCas9 to upregulate NF1. 2) Deploy this NF1 luciferase reporter assay to screen 50+ known drugs shown by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression across various cell/tissue types. Next, use this validated luciferase reporter to screen a 13,000+ compound repurposing library of known drugs available from Scripps Research Institute (known as ReFrame). 3) The top hits from Aim 2 screens will be evaluated, utilizing both immortalized and iPSC derived NF1+/- Schwann cells, for the following: a) ability to induce NF1 mRNA and protein expression, using qPCR and Westerns, b) the impact on Ras signaling (pERK, ELK-1, AKT, etc.) utilizing a targeted quantitative mass spec proteomics assay, c) their broader impact on gene expression in Schwann cells utilizing RNAseq, d) impact on cell proliferation, and e) their safety profile based on published data from previous trials. The goal is to prioritize not more than 3-5 candidates to take forward into a Phase 2 evaluation. Project Narrative Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that impacts an estimated 1 in 3000 people worldwide, and one that is characterized by a complex set of symptoms shown to be dependent on haploinsufficiency (i.e., the lack of normal protein). By upregulating NF1 protein expression from the normal allele by two-fold, and thus restoring normal levels of functional NF1 protein in tissues important in NF1, we target a range of NF1 symptoms by eliminating the haploinsufficient environment. We propose to develop and utilize NF1-specific luciferase reporter and proteomic assays, along with standard small molecule evaluation tools, to characterize a small molecule library of repurposed drugs for their ability to upregulate NF1 transcription, and to further evaluate the resulting impact of “hits” on NF1 protein expression, cell proliferation, gene expression specificity, as well as downstream pathways (such as Ras, MEK, mTOR) known to be dysregulated by mutations in the NF1 gene.",Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency,10145101,R43NS117234,"['Alleles

"Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration PROJECT SUMMARY The cell nucleus is a heterogeneous organelle that consists of nuclear bodies such as nuclear lamina, speckles, nucleoli and PML bodies. These structures continuously tether and tug chromatin at the small and large scales to synergistically orchestrate dynamic functions in distinct spatio-temporal compartments. A major obstacle to the production of navigable 4D reference maps and relating structure to function in the nucleus remains understanding how these different scales of organization influence each other. In particular, we have a poor understanding of the large-scale genome organization. Growing evidence suggests that such nuclear compartmentalization is causally connected with vital genome functions in human health and disease. However, the principles of this nuclear compartmentalization, its dynamics during changes in cell conditions, and its functional relevance are poorly understood. One lesson from Phase 1 4DN was the huge gap in throughput between imaging methods, that directly measure large-scale multi-landmark relationships, and genomic methods, that aim for whole genome high-resolution maps but are indirect measurements and provide limited information about large-scale compartments. For this 4DN UM1 Center application, we propose to meet these needs through the following Aims: (1) Generate multi-modal imaging and genomic datasets to reveal the structure, dynamics, and function of nuclear compartmentalization; (2) Develop and apply computational tools for data-driven genome structure modeling and integrative analysis of nuclear compartmentalization; (3) Develop an integrative analysis and visualization platform with navigable 4D reference maps of nuclear organization. The combined datasets and results of our proposed approaches will advance our understanding of nuclear compartmentalization, the interwoven connections among different nuclear components, and their functional significance. Our new integrative analysis tools and data-driven predictive models will produce more complete nuclear organization reference maps that integrate large-scale chromosome structure data from live and super-resolution microscopy with multi-modal genomic data including smaller scale chromatin interaction maps and predict functional relationships and dynamic responses. Our navigable reference maps will be publicly accessible through an analysis platform that provides interactive visualization of multiple data types, thus enabling investigators with diverse expertise to simultaneously explore their own data and related datasets/tools and promoting collaborations that will open new horizons into the role of the 4D nucleome in human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will enhance our understanding of nuclear genome organization and functions that are increasingly being linked to health and disease. Because we develop tools to disseminate this information and enable others to work with our data and their own data, we will also bring nuclear architecture to bear on a broad range of ongoing health related research. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that seeks to obtain fundamental knowledge that will help to improve human health.",Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration,10267774,UM1HG011593,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Atlases ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cytology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mission ', ' Structural Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organelles ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Intuition ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' cell type ', ' Nuclear ', ' cell cycle genetics ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Genomics ', ' Nuclear Lamina ', ' histone modification ', ' Interphase Chromosome ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Temporal DNA Replication Order ', ' Temporal DNA Replication Pattern ', ' DNA Replication Timing ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromatin Loop ', ' Chromatin Loop Domains ', ' DNA Loop ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Nuclear Structure ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' mental function ', ' Formulation ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' Visualization ', ' data tools ', ' multiple data types ', ' multiscale data ', ' multi-scale data ', ' data exploration ', ' ']",NHGRI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,UM1,2021,2075409
"Advancing personalized medicine in PD using harmonized multi-site clinical data Project Summary Among neurological disorders, the fastest growing is now Parkinson's disease (PD), surpassing Alzheimer's dis- ease. PD manifests as a heterogeneous clinical syndrome and this variability in the clinical phenotype highlights the need to tailor the type and/or the dosage of treatment to the speciﬁc and changing needs of individuals living with PD. The main goal of individualized, or precision, medicine is to use patient characteristics to determine an individualized treatment strategy (ITS) to promote wellness. Due to the complex nature of PD coupled with phenotypic heterogeneity, formulating successful individualized approaches to medical care is a complex prob- lem that may beneﬁt from a more data-driven approach. One of the challenges in developing reliable ITSs is that the analyses require studies with fairly large sample sizes and longitudinal assessment of subjects over a relatively long period of time. The data set must also include various prescribing patterns to allow the analytic method to learn the effects of different treatment sequences (strategies). These important requirements preclude investigators from using data from a single clinical study to construct data-driven ITSs. Existing guidelines for symptomatic drug therapy for PD can best be described as ""permissive"". The relative lack of comparative evidence for different classes of drugs has created challenges in devising recommendations to follow any speciﬁc therapeutic strategy. We ﬁll this important gap by proposing a two phase study. The ﬁrst phase (R61) focuses on creating a harmonized and curated dataset by integrating data from six clinical trials and the PPMI observational study that, in aggregate, involved 4,705 patients followed from 23.5 to 96 months. To the best of our knowledge, such comprehensive data harmonization has not been done before in PD and it can provide an excellent source of information for future studies as well. In the second phase (R33), we will leverage the harmonized data set to develop high quality ITSs for PD with respect to several clinical outcomes including UPDRS score, quality of life, and Schwab and England (SE) ADL measured at 24 and 48 months of follow-up. Speciﬁcally, the goals of the R33 phase are to (Aim 1) compare commonly used sequences of drug classes for PD; (Aim 2) identify the best individualized treatment strategies to inform optimal sequences of drug classes for PD. In pursuit of these aims, we will propose robust, rigorous and computationally efﬁcient statistical machine learning methods for constructing data-driven optimal ITSs for PD. The proposal expands the scope of existing methods in developing ITSs by relaxing certain unrealistic assumptions and through the use of ﬂexible modeling techniques (e.g., machine learning methods) while maintaining valid statistical inference. These new methods will be integrated into easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language (Aim 3). This will maximize the adoption of the proposed methodology by other investigators and allow researchers to analyze other PD datasets with a goal of constructing an ITS for PD. Furthermore, because the methods are not disease-speciﬁc, our methods and software will enable similar exploration for other diseases. Project Narrative Constructing reliable individualized treatment strategies requires studies with fairly large sample sizes with longi- tudinal assessment of subjects over a relatively long period of time. To this end, we will create a harmonized and curated dataset by integrating data from seven long-term observational and randomized studies in Parkinson's disease. Using this harmonized data, we will develop and apply robust, rigorous and computationally efﬁcient methods for estimating an optimal individualized treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease with respect to var- ious outcomes (e.g., Uniﬁed Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, quality of life, and Schwab and England ADL score).

"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving, yet the donor organ shortage and high organ discard rate contributes to 13 deaths daily among patients awaiting transplant. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on microscopic quantitation of chronic damage by pathologists. The current standard of care relies on a manual process that is subject to significant human variability and inefficiency, resulting in potentially healthy kidneys being discarded and potentially damaged kidneys being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model to quantify percent global glomerulosclerosis in donor kidney frozen section biopsy whole slide images. We developed a cloud-based platform to apply the Deep Learning model to analyze kidney biopsy whole slide images in under 6 minutes with accuracy and precision equal to or greater than current standard of care pathologists. We have also developed a Deep Learning model to quantify interstitial fibrosis on donor kidney biopsy whole slide images. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, improved patient outcomes, and diminished health care costs. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated techniques as the standard for evaluating donor kidneys prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the interstitial fibrosis Deep Learning model, use the automated quantitation of key microscopic findings to develop an outcome-based chronic damage score that predicts graft outcome, and test the ability of the Deep Learning models to withstand variations encountered using different scanners and processing in different laboratories. The functionality of the Trusted Kidney software platform will be improved beyond the current usable product into a commercially viable solution for multiple laboratories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Before kidneys can be transplanted, they must be examined using a microscope to ensure the kidney is healthy enough for transplant. A limitation of microscopic examination by pathologists is the inherent human variability in quantifying the amount of scar tissue, or chronic damage, present. The result is potentially healthy organs being discarded or damaged kidneys being used inappropriately. This funding will support developing artificial intelligence tools to assist pathologists with quantifying scar tissue in donor kidneys prior to transplantation, resulting in more consistent and objective biopsy evaluations, minimizing discard of potentially healthy kidneys, and optimizing placement of kidneys for transplant.",A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies,10266188,R42DK120253,"['Adoption ', ' Americas ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Canada ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Computers ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Frozen Sections ', ' Freeze Sectioning ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Trichrome stain ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' glomerulosclerosis ', ' glomerular sclerosis ', ' image processing ', ' Organ ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' interstitial ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' technological innovation ', ' Modeling ', ' Trichrome ', ' Trichrome stain method ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' United Network for Organ Sharing ', ' UNOS ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' analytical tool ', ' functional improvement ', ' function improvement ', ' commercial application ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' Secure ', ' cloud based ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal biopsy ', ' renal damage ', ' damage to kidney ', ' kidney damage ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' shared database ', ' shared data base ', ' ']",NIDDK,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R42,2021,725526
"Privacy-preserving genomic medicine at scale 1 Project Summary  2  3 High-throughput sequencing, biomedical imaging, and electronic health record technologies are 4 generating health-related datasets of unprecedented scale. Integrative analysis of these  5 resources promises to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. Yet, the  6 sensitive nature of these data often requires that they be kept in isolated silos, limiting their 7 usefulness to science. The goal of this project is to develop innovative privacy-preserving  8 algorithms to enable data sharing and drive genomic medicine. Crucially, we will draw upon our  9 past success in secure genome analysis and algorithmic expertise in computational biology to 10 address the imminent need to perform complex integrative analyses securely and at scale. 11 Current privacy-preserving tools are prohibitively too costly to perform the complex 12 calculations required in genomic analysis. We previously leveraged the highly structured nature 13 of biological data and novel optimization strategies to implement efficient pipelines for secure 14 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and drug interaction predictions which scaled to 15 millions of samples. In this project, we will further exploit the unique properties of biomedical data 16 to: (i) develop secure integrative analysis methods for genomic medicine; (ii) develop an easy-to- 17 use programming environment with advanced automated optimizations to facilitate the adoption 18 of privacy-preserving analyses; and (iii) promote the use of our privacy techniques to gain novel 19 biological insights through large-scale collaborative genetic studies of multi-ethnic cohorts. 20 With co-I’s Amarasinghe (MIT) and Cho (Broad Institute), we aim to apply these tools to 21 realize the first multi-institution, multi-national secure genetic studies with our partners at the 22 Swiss Personalized Health Network, UK Biobank, Finnish FinnGen, All of Us, NIH NCBI, Broad 23 and Barcelona Supercomputing Center (Letters of Support). We will also use our privacy- 24 preserving approaches to study genomic origins of polygenic traits for disease as well as 25 neuroimaging and other clinical phenotypes. We will continue to actively integrate our methods 26 into community standards (MPEG-G, GA4GH). 27 Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods and open-source, 28 easy-to-use, production-grade implementations that open the door to secure integration and 29 analysis of massive sets of sensitive genomic and clinical data. With input from our collaborations, 30 we will build these tools and apply them to better understand the molecular causes of human 31 health and its translation to the clinic. Project Narrative Combining genomic and health-related data from millions of patients will empower the development of clinically relevant measures of human health and disease risks. However, this task requires securely sharing sensitive data at an immense scale beyond what existing cryptographic platforms can achieve.

"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies. Public Health Statement Vascular health is an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases We propose to develop a method that can produce quantifiable images of multiple blood flow related parameters with a single scan and without the use of contrast injections.

"Development of a Bio-tissue Oxygenation Nanophosphor Enabled Sensing (BONES) system for Quantifying Hypoxia in Bone Marrow Project Summary/Abstract Low oxygen (hypoxic) environments are known to be important for maintaining the small number of adult stem cells in the human body, such as in bone marrow. These conditions are also believed to enable dormant cancer cells to survive and metastasize years or decades after the original tumor has been destroyed and the reason why bone marrow is one of the most common sites of cancer metastasis. Understanding of these conditions can drive the development of 3D cellular scaffolds for growing stem cells ex vivo, thus reducing the burden on requiring bone marrow transplants, and for developing therapeutics that prevent cancer relapse. This project proposes to develop the first quantitative oxygen tomographic imaging system called BONES (Bio-tissue Oxygenation Nanophosphor Enabled Sensing) to address the critical need for high resolution imaging of oxygen concentrations in hypoxic (low oxygen) tissues such as bone marrow. The technique is based on developments in x-ray luminescence computed tomography, an emerging molecular imaging technique capable of achieving cellular level resolution and high sensitivities. The approach uses x-rays to excite oxygen-sensitive nanophosphors that emit near-infrared photons to finally enable 3D oxygen measurements in deep bone marrow. Because the technique requires a multidisciplinary team with x-ray expertise, nanophosphor expertise, near-infrared detection expertise, and algorithms for quantifying the concentrations and minimizing dose, this STTR fast-track proposal involves several institutions with deep expertise in their respective domains. The proposed Phase I 6-month project is a proof-of- principle demonstration of a breadboard system used on nanophosphors in low oxygen solutions and embedded in bone. The proposed Phase II 24-month project is to develop a complete prototype system and experimentally verify its performance. Project Narrative This project proposes to develop the first quantitative oxygen tomographic imaging system called BONES (Bio-tissue Oxygenation Nanophosphor Enabled Sensing) to address the critical need for high resolution imaging of oxygen concentrations in hypoxic (low oxygen) tissues such as bone marrow. Local oxygen microenvironments and changes to oxygen tensions over only tens of micrometers are known to be important for maintaining stem cell growth and are suspected to also enable cancer metastases, but are poorly understood because there are no methods with the resolution and sensitivity required. The proposed solution will finally enable 3D oxygen measurements in deep bone marrow based on a newly developed technique called x- ray luminescence computed tomography (XLCT) and oxygen-sensitive nanophosphors for 10 to 100 µm imaging of oxygen concentrations.",Development of a Bio-tissue Oxygenation Nanophosphor Enabled Sensing (BONES) system for Quantifying Hypoxia in Bone

"Development of Accurate and Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms for their application in Medicine Project Summary  The objective of this proposal is to provide a robust course of training for Gilmer Valdes, PhD, DABR, a candidate with an excellent foundation in clinical and machine learning research, to enable him to become an independent investigator. The proposed research aims to address a tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy of modern machine learning algorithms which limits their use in clinical practice. The candidate’s central hypothesis is that the current tradeoff is not a law of nature but rather a limitation of current interpretable machine learning algorithms. Towards proving this hypothesis, the candidate, leading a multidisciplinary team, have developed unique mathematical frameworks (MediBoost and the Conditional Interpretable Super Learner) to build interpretable and accurate models. The proposed research will I) implement and extensively benchmark these frameworks and II) use the algorithms develop to solve three clinical problems where potentially suboptimal models are currently used to make clinical decisions: 1) predicting mortality in the Intensive Care Unit, 2) predicting risk of Hospital Acquired Venous Thromboembolism, 3) predicting which prostate cancer patients benefit the most from adjuvant radiotherapy. The candidate’s training and research plan, multidisciplinary by nature, takes advantage of the proximity of UC San Francisco, Stanford and UC Berkeley and proposes a training plan that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of the work proposed, the author will be mentored and work closely with a stellar committee from three institutions and different scientific areas (Machine Learning, Biostatistics, Statistics, Hospital Medicine, Cancer Research and Quality Assurance in Medicine): Jerome H. Friedman PhD (Stanford Statistics Department), Mark Van der Laan PhD (Berkeley Biostatistics and Statistics Department), Mark Segal (UCSF Epidimiology and Biostatistics Deparments), Andrew Auerbach MD (UCSF Medicine Department), Felix Y. Feng MD (UCSF Radiation Oncology),and Timothy D. Solberg PhD (UCSF Radiation Oncology). This committee will be coordinated by Dr Solberg. The candidate also counts with a strong a multidisciplinary team of collaborators. Successful completion of the proposed research will develop the next generation of accurate and interpretable Machine Learning algorithms and solve three important clinical problems where linear models are currently used in clinical settings. This proposal has wide-ranging implications across the healthcare spectrum. The intermediate-term goal is for the candidate to acquire the knowledge, technical skills and expertise necessary to submit a successful R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current state of the art machine learning algorithms have a marked tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In medicine, where errors can have a dire consequence and knowledge representation and validation is as relevant as accuracy, the development of accurate and interpretable algorithms is of paramount importance.

"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",10246990,R01CA227122,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Uterus ', ' womb ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Leisures ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Ovarian ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Light Exercise ', ' Light Activity ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' cancer type ', ' older women ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Accelerometer ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' vigorous intensity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,640965
"Continuous Probing of Nanoconstruct-Cell Interactions at Biologically Relevant Time Scales PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal aims to develop live-cell, multi-channel imaging tools that can visualize—continuously, and in real time—nanoparticle interactions with cellular components. We will focus on several different time windows, where early time periods will monitor nanoparticle-cell membrane binding and uptake and later times will track endosomal accumulation and escape. The ability to resolve temporally and spatially how particle size/shape and ligand density affects interactions in 3D is critical for determining structure-activity-relationships and mechanism of action in live cells. To characterize interactions of functional nanoparticles with different cellular structures at physiologically relevant times, we propose to design a multi-channel optical microscope integrated with an opto- splitter and custom live-cell imaging chamber. Simultaneous images can be acquired in different channels of the fluorescence of dye-labeled organelles and dye-labeled ligands on the particles as well as differential interference contrast (DIC) signals of whole cells, cellular components, and nanoparticle cores. Correlation of structural and functional images provides a powerful window into how local nanoconstruct interactions can mediate a biological response. For model systems, we will compare gold nanoconstructs with oligonucleotide ligand shells of both targeting (DNA aptamers) or non-targeting (siRNA) properties. Nanoparticle shape enables a unique handle to probe rotation and orientation of intracellular particle interactions. This work can bridge a gap in understanding the behavior of nanoconstructs intracellularly and how the integrity and presentation of oligonucleotides in ligand shells affects targeting and other processes such as endosomal escape, which is critical to assess therapeutic efficacy. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  This proposal aims to design tools that can visualize nanoparticle interactions with cells at distinct time points with biological relevance. Our ultimate goal is to evaluate how nanoconstructs interact with cellular membranes and sub-cellular components.

"Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings In response to an immunological challenge, immune cells act in concert forming complex and dense networks. A deep understanding of these immune responses is often the first step in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. Multivariate modeling algorithms can simultaneously consider all measured aspects of the immune system but requires prohibitively larger cohort sizes as technological advancements increase the number of measurements (a.k.a., “Curse of Dimensionality”). To address this, we propose a series of studies to develop machine learning algorithms for comprehensive profiling of the immune system in clinical settings. Particularly, for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell-level, we will leverage the stochastic nature of clustering algorithms to produce a robust pipeline for prediction of clinical outcomes. Next, we introduce the immunological Elastic-Net (iEN) algorithm, which addresses both the curse of dimensionality and reproducibility by integrating prior immunological knowledge into the models.  The cellular systems that govern immunity act through symbiotic interactions with multiple interconnected biological systems. The simultaneous interrogation of these systems with suitable technologies can reveal otherwise unrecognized crosstalk. In collaboration with several leading laboratories, we have produced multiomics datasets (including analysis the genome, proteome, microbiome, and metabolome) in synchronized groups of patients. Using these coordinated datasets, we will evaluate several algorithms for combining multiple biological modalities while accounting for the intrinsic characteristics of each assay, to reveal biological cross- talk across various systems and increase combined predictive power. Importantly, numerous population- level factors (including medical history, environmental, and socioeconomic factors) significantly impact the immune system and studies focused on homogenous patient populations often lack generalizability to other populations. To address this, we will develop machine learning strategies to integrate population-level factors directly into our immunological data. These models will objectively define subpopulations of patients and enable flexibility in the coefficients of the models (and hence, the importance of the various biological measurements) in each group.  This research program will be executed using data from several biorepositories focused on various diseases. This approach will ensure generalizability of our work to previously unseen datasets and increase the long-term impact of our findings. Throughout the proposal, a major area of focus is the development of visualization and model-reduction strategies that lay the foundation for interpretation of complex models. The machine learning algorithms developed will be readily applicable to a broad range of multiomics and multicohort studies and will be available as open-source software. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent technological advances have enabled the production of large immune monitoring datasets, providing an opportunity for systems-level efforts to harness the power of the immune system in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. In this project, we will develop machine learning algorithms for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell level, in a multiomics setting integrated with various other biological measurements, and subject to adjustments based on population-level factors.

"Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection. Brains transform sensory information into decisions and decisions into behaviors, which ultimately determine fitness. Behavior can be broken down into a set of discrete chunks of movement, called actions. The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions. My work aims to understand how striatal circuits perform action selection on a moment- to-moment timescale.",Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection.,10238135,F31NS113385,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Anions ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Endoscopes ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Rhodopsin ', ' Visual Purple ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Substantia nigra structure ', ' Substantia Nigra ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' calcium indicator ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' miniaturize ', ' complement pathway ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' microendoscopy ', ' endomicroscopy ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' Postural adjustments ', ' Postural alterations ', ' Postural changes ', ' ']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2021,33868
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology.

"Tracking single-cell gene expression heterogeneity and its consequences in bacterial biofilms Project Summary Bacterial biofilms are surface-attached communities of bacterial cells enclosed in an extracellular matrix. Biofilms are a concern in health and in industrial operations because of persistent infections, clogging of flows, and surface fouling. Recent advances in single-cell live imaging have revealed well-defined cell ordering in individual biofilm clusters and the underlying biomechanical principles that shape them. However, we have little understanding of which genes are activated in each biofilm-dwelling cell and how cell organization is determined by the gene expression pattern at the single-cell level. We do not know whether and how gene expression profiles vary from cell to cell in biofilms, and what consequences such heterogeneity has on biofilm development. Cell-to-cell variation in biofilms could underly the notorious difficulty in eradicating biofilms in chronic infections because of the differential response of biofilm cells to antibiotic treatment. In this proposal we put forward ideas to address this challenge by developing new imaging platforms to capture the biofilm growth dynamics and associated gene expression pattern at the single-cell level. Using these imaging platforms, we will uncover the intricate interplay between single-cell gene expression, individual cell behavior, and local cell organization that underlies the developmental program of bacterial biofilms. Specifically, we will use deep learning algorithms to push the temporal and spatial resolution limits in single-cell biofilm imaging, and develop an innovative, coupled segmentation-tracking method to generate a robust three-dimensional lineage tracing algorithm in growing biofilms. By combining lineage tracing and fluorescent reporters, we will follow the spatiotemporal expression pattern of each individual cell throughout biofilm development. By focusing on matrix production, degradation, and cell dispersion, we will create concrete examples of gene expression heterogeneity at the single-cell level and the associated consequences in 3D biofilms. In addition, we will investigate heterogeneity in genes involved in intra- and intercellular signaling, in motility and attachment, and in cell shape regulation to broaden our finding. With these efforts, we will reveal how individual gene expression, cell behavior, and local cell ordering reciprocally interact with each other to define biofilm architecture and development. The knowledge obtained in the current proposal offers new strategies for manipulating complex bacterial communities and has the potential to change the clinical procedure of treating biofilm-related diseases, for example by developing new chemicals that specifically induce dispersal or target the recalcitrant cell populations. Project Narrative: Bacterial biofilms are the predominant lifestyle of bacteria in nature and they can also cause chronic infections that are difficulty to treat. This study aims to track the gene expression profile in each biofilm cell and to dissect the intricate interplay between single-cell gene expression, individual cell behavior, and local cell organization that underlies the developmental program of bacterial biofilms. Such an understanding is crucial for combatting biofilm-related problems and harnessing beneficial biofilms.",Tracking single-cell gene expression heterogeneity and its consequences in bacterial biofilms,10242439,DP2GM146253,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Industrialization ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Production ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Microbial Biofilms ', ' biofilm ', ' Procedures ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' response ', ' Regulation of Cell Shape ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' operation ', ' imaging platform ', ' live cell imaging ', ' live cell image ', ' live cellular image ', ' live cellular imaging ', ' chronic infection ', ' persistent infection ', ' bacterial community ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,YALE UNIVERSITY,DP2,2021,1507500
"Functional Determinants in G-Protein-Coupled Receptors FUNCTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this work is to rationally manipulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) activation with the hope to develop novel therapeutic approaches in this major family of transmembrane receptors and drug targets. Our hypothesis is that evolutionary divergence patterns can reveal the roles that GPCR sequence positions play, individually or together, in order to mediate ligand binding, allosteric conformational switching, and finally ligand-biased activation of efferent signaling pathways, which can be G protein-dependent or independent. In the past funding period, computational analysis of such evolutionary patterns revealed: Intramolecular allosteric communication in the transmembrane domain of dopamine D2R receptor; Modular components of an allosteric switch controlling B2AR functional selectivity; A new non-canonical cAMP- independent signaling pathway in that same receptor; and Ligand specificity determinants in the extracellular domain of metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluR). Technical progress led to: increased accuracy to assess the impact of coding mutations in proteins through a first-principle equation for the evolutionary variations of genotype and phenotype; The generalization of our analyses of evolutionary divergence to consider co-varying residues; and new methods to unravel complex simultaneous assay readouts to stratify drug effects on GPCRs. Together these and other data support new aims that combine biological and algorithmic goals: 1. To titrate mutationally the signaling bias of bioamine receptors. 2. To uncover allosteric mediators in metabotropic glutamate receptors. 3. To identify a systematic role of GPCR mutations in cancer. The outcome should reveal new aspects of the molecular basis of signaling in an important family of pharmaceutical targets. It will also link sequence and structure genomics databases to the molecular basis of function and to the rational re- design of protein function–key steps towards manipulating cellular pathways. FUNCTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS Narrative of the project G protein-coupled receptors account for nearly half of all current medications, yet so far relatively few have been successfully targeted by drugs. One of the difficulties is that we have limited knowledge of their mechanisms at a detailed level.

"Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation Project Summary/Abstract: With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the breadth and depth of different omics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of individuals in genomic data science. Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices. Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects, such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Project Narrative: Sharing large-scale functional genomics data is critical for scientific discovery, but comes with important privacy concerns related to the possible misuse of such data. This proposal will quantify and manage the rieslkasted to releasing functional genomics datasets, based on integrating inferred genotypes from the raw sequence files, signal tracks, and microbiome mapped sequences. Finally, we will develop file formats, statistical methodologies, and related software for anonymization of functional genomics data that enable open sharing.",Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation,10251876,R01HG010749,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Privatization ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Privacy ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Glean ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' human tissue ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' microbial ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' file format ', ' data sharing ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Science ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' privacy preservation ', ' Hi-C ', ' ']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,526482
"Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc- tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi- ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol- ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam- ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo- rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex- traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us- ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti- cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in- clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova- tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol- umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo- rithms will segment the images at multiple scales. The third area of innovation will focus on efficient multi- channel analysis. The proposed project will include creation of an easy-to-use software tool for assembling and visualizing multiscale tissue data called Tissue Atlas Navigation Graphical Overview (TANGO). PROJECT NARRATIVE Composition and organization of cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) they are embedded in, controls the function of different organs in human body. Alterations in any of these can lead to onset and progression of var- ious diseases.

"Building protein structure models for intermediate resolution cryo-electron microscopy maps Project Summary Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an emerging technique in structural biology, which is capable of determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules. Compared to conventional structural biology techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR, a major advantage of cryo-EM is its ability to solve large macromolecular assemblies. Moreover, recent technical breakthroughs in cryo-EM have enabled determination of 3D structures at nearly atomic-level resolutions. Cryo-EM will undoubtedly become a method of central importance in structural biology in the next decade. With the rapid accumulation of cryo-EM structure data, it has become crucial to develop computational methods that can effectively build and extract 3D structures of biological macromolecules from EM maps. The goal of this project is to develop computational methods for modeling both global and local structures and for interpreting 3D structures embedded in EM maps of around 4 Å to medium-resolution. Recently, we have developed a new de novo protein structure modeling method, MAINMAST, which can model protein structures from an EM density map without using existing template or fragment structures on the map. Based on the successful development of MAINMAST, we further extend the capability of MAINMAST toward more accurate modeling and for multiple-chain modeling. In addition, we will also develop novel modeling methods for medium-resolution EM maps, which combine a coarse-grained protein structure modeling technique, methods in protein structure prediction, and a low- resolution image processing approach with deep learning, a state-of-the-art powerful machine learning method. The proposed project capitalizes on the tremendous efforts and progress made in structural determination with cryo-EM by developing computational tools that allow researchers to perform efficient and reliable structure analyses for 3D EM density maps. The project will greatly facilitate investigation into the molecular mechanisms of macromolecule function by providing an efficient means of 3D structure modeling.

"Next generation mosquito control through technology-driven trap development and artificial intelligence guided detection of mosquito breeding habitats Project Summary Each year, approximately 400 million people are infected with an arboviral disease from the bite of an Aedes spp mosquito. Aedes spp. mosquitoes are a leading public health threat due to their high competency to vector multiple pathogens, their preference to bite humans, and their ability to adapt to new domestic environments. In the US, reintroduction and establishment of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito populations has resulted in local epidemics of Zika, dengue and chikungunya in the past decade. Unfortunately, mosquito control programs in the US generally operate with limited budgets, forcing the majority of insecticide spraying to be conducted in reaction to population exposure instead of targeted prevention, which has also contributed to considerable growth of insecticide resistant populations, yielding a widening gap of infrastructure vulnerability. Our current proposal aims to leverage existing technologies from non-health disciplines to advance mosquito detection and abatement. We propose to validate the use of technology-driven mosquito traps that allow for high- throughput identification and counting of Aedes mosquitos at various life stages to inform decision making when selecting areas for insecticide spraying and abatement. Additionally, we propose to develop rigorous remote sensing workflows for identification of neighborhood-level Aedes abundance risk and rapid detection of individual Aedes mosquito breeding habitats on a household-level. This innovative proposal uses multi-year and real-world mosquito data from two different metropolitan areas to statistically adjust for variances in geographic ecologies, urban microclimates, seasonal climate patterns, and annual weather events. Our study will result in low-cost tools immediately ready for broad distribution and integration by vector control agencies nationally. The outcomes of our study have promise to directly impact vector control agency’s decision-making processes for mosquito trapping site selection, inform preventative abetment protocols, and shorten the time required for mosquito collection and identification. Further, integration of our proposed technology traps and informed site selection maps will increase overall collection volumes while preserving scarce resources for local vector control agencies. This proposal has the potential to create a paradigm shift in how we approach vector control globally, with a targeted intervention resulting in significant economic, environmental, and clinical benefits. Project Narrative Mosquito-borne diseases are a global concern that impact public health, tourism, and natural disaster recovery efforts. With no preventative vaccines or effective therapeutic option available for most mosquito-borne diseases, vector control efforts are the only combative option; however, these efforts are often limited by financial constraint and insecticide resistance concern.

"Novel machine learning approaches for improving structural discrimination in cryo-electron tomography-Administrative Supplement Project Summary Cellular cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) has made possible the observation of cellular organelles and macromolecular complexes at nanometer resolution with native conformations. The rapid increasing amount of Cryo-ET data available however brings along some major challenges for analysis which we will timely address in this proposal. We will design novel data- driven machine learning algorithms for improving structural discrimination and resolution. In particular, we have the following specific aims: (1) We will develop a novel Autoencoder and Iterative region Matching (AIM) algorithm for marker-free alignment of image tilt-series to reconstruct tomograms with improved resolution; (2) We will develop a saliency-based auto- picking algorithm for better detecting macromolecular complexes, and combine it with an innovative 2D-to-3D framework to further improve structure detection accuracy; (3) We will design an end-to-end convolutional model for pose-invariant clustering of subtomograms. This model will produce an initial clustering which will be refined by a new subtomogram averaging algorithm that automatically down weights subtomograms of noise and little contribution; (4) We will perform experimental evaluations by using previously reported bacterial secretion systems and mitochondrial ultrastructures datasets to improve the final resolution. Implementing algorithms in Aims 1-3, we will develop a user-friendly open-source graphical user interface α-tom to directly benefit the scientific community. α-tom will be systematically compared with existing software including IMOD, EMAN2, and Relion on simulated and benchmark datasets. To facilitate distribution, α-tom will be integrated into existing software platforms Scipion and TomoMiner. Our data-driven algorithms and software not only will facilitate and accelerate the future use of Cryo- ET, but also can be readily used on analyzing the existing large amounts of Cryo-ET data to improve our understanding of the structure, function, and spatial organization of macromolecular complexes in situ. Project Narrative This project will create a system of machine learning algorithms to accelerate and facilitate the use and re-use of the rapidly accumulating Cryo-ET datasets. For easy use, we will develop an open-source GUI α-Tom (to be disseminated into the Scipion and TomoMiner software platforms) that streamlines the new approaches from the initial tomogram reconstruction step to the final subtomogram averaging step.

"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",10387787,R01GM136859,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Crowding ', ' Environment ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Isotopes ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Medical Research ', ' Specialist ', ' Biochemical ', ' insight ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Data ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Resolution ', ' Therapeutic Studies ', ' Therapy Research ', ' Computational Technique ', ' protein function ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,75000
"Functional annotation of new genes aided by deep learning New genes (NGs) are generated by multiple mechanisms and their end-piece sequences are identified as the chimeric transcript sequence from multiple human sources including healthy and disease tissues. Therefore, NGs have been recognized as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision medicine. Many efforts have been made to study individual NG function and to identify relevant drug targets. However, the current in-depth research and achievements are mainly concentrated on several driver NGs, and classical cancer drugs have been directly used to target the NG domains, such as the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 fusion protein in leukemia. Some of the fusion proteins with retaining DNA-binding domains such as transcription factors can directly bind their target genes, such as the EWSR1-FLI fusion actively recruiting BAF complex. Recently, the downstream effectors of driver FGs have emerged as therapeutic targets. For example, targeting the downstream CCND2 inhibited RUNX1/ETO-driven leukemic expansion in vitro and in vivo and inhibition of STAT5, the downstream factor of NUP214-ABL1 led to the induction of leukemia cell death. However, the functions of most identified FGs have not been systematically investigated. This is mainly due to the limitations of traditional tools and the high cost of experimental procedures. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new tools for analyzing NG breakpoint-specific features systemically in the human genome and predict their originating and regulatory mechanisms, such as upstream and downstream effectors. In-depth annotation based on NG structure is important for understanding the cellular mechanisms of NGs. Effective use of systematic bioinformatics tools for functional annotation can provide a deeper insight into the role of NGs in the development and progression of diseases such as cancers to find direct and indirect therapeutic targets. In this study, we will develop five bioinformatics tools for the functional annotation and feature analysis of NGs, a predictive pipeline for automatic analysis of downstream effects of NGs, and a predictive method for tracing the origin of NGs. This project will be a substantial contribution to public health by systematically function of new genes (NGs) in human disease. These systematic annotation results will be performed through ChimerAnno (a tool for functional annotation of human chimeric genes), FGviewer (a tool for visualizing multi- tiered functional features of fusion genes), NGeffector with DeepChIP (a tool for predicting NG downstream effectors with enhanced transcription factor binding site prediction with deep learning), DeepCLIP (a tool for providing evidence of origin of NGs for trans-splicing mechanism), FusionAI (a tool for feature extraction of human new genes' breakpoint (BP)), FusionGDB 2.0 (updated fusion gene annotation aided by deep learning), and NewGeneDB (a knowledgebase of new genes).

"Reactome IDG portal: Pathway-based analysis and visualization of understudied human proteins Project Summary Proteins function through interactions with other proteins and biological entities to form biological pathways inside and between cells. Targeted therapies are designed to mitigate or reverse malfunctions caused by mutations in proteins via providing drugs to recover normal biological pathways’ activities. Projecting understudied proteins in the context of biological pathways is a powerful way to infer potential functions of these proteins. Pathway-based approaches are now routinely applied in bioinformatics and computational biology data analysis and visualization. Pathway databases are essential for those approaches. During the past two decades, our team has been working together on building the Reactome knowledgebase, arguably the most popular and comprehensive open source biological pathway database, covering over half of human protein-coding genes and widely used in the research community. In this application, we propose to develop a Reactome IDG pathway portal, which will allow localization of understudied proteins in biological pathways, identifying likely interactions with better-known proteins in specific processes annotated in Reactome, pinpointing most effective drug targets via pathway modeling, thus generating testable predictions of molecular functions of these proteins in key domains of biology. Specially we will develop a web-based application to place understudied proteins in the context of Reactome pathways by importing a variety of data types collected in the IDG projects and other resources and then overlaying them onto the Reactome pathways by leveraging existing Reactome software tools (e.g. interaction overlay). Furthermore, we will develop a machine learning approach to predict functional interactions between understudied proteins and well-known Reactome annotated proteins and a Boolean network-based fuzzy logic modeling approach to integrate the scores produced from the machine learning approach to simulate the impacts of understudied proteins on pathways’ activities. We believe our approach will provide a unique and powerful approach to help the community to understand the contribution of the understudied proteins to cellular functions.

"Genome Informatics For Biobank-scale Data Genetic data of biobank scales offer a wealth of information that is not obvious in traditional smaller cohorts. We will develop and evaluate efficient and accurate algorithms and tools for the analysis of such data to reveal such information. In particular, we will develop methods for three main tasks: haplotype phasing refinement, genotype imputation, and relatedness inference. Although mature methods are available for these tasks in traditional smaller data sets, there is still a lack of scalable efficient and accurate methods and tools for handling genomic big data of that scale. Our main observation is that biobank-scale genetic data offer dense connections between individual data points. Unlike traditional methods based on the Li and Stephens hidden Markov models (HMMs), we models each individual using the individual-specific cohort, i.e., all the other individuals that are connected to the individual. We leverage the efficient positional Burrows-Wheeler transformation (PBWT), a foundational data structure for modeling haplotype matching. We were the first to develop a PBWT-based method for identifying IBD segments in biobank-scale cohorts, RaPID. We are also enriched the traditional PBWT data structure and algorithms to efficient haplotype search and allowing dynamic updates. In this application, we leverage our algorithm development expertise and develop an IBD-based algorithm for refining haplotype phasing of very large panels. We will also develop IBD-based algorithms for improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness of genotype imputation using a very large reference panel. In addition, we will develop RaPID-Affin algorithms for efficient and accurate inference of genetic relatedness. Finally, we will benchmark the methods and develop free software for the community. This project will empower modern genetic research by developing efficient informatics tools for very large genotyped cohorts. While large biobank-scale cohort offer new opportunities for genetics research, they also created daunting informatics challenges.

"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10445126,R44EY031202,"['Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optometry ', ' Optometries ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Vitamins ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Telemedicine ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' Atrophic AMD ', ' Atrophic age-related macular degeneration ', ' Dry AMD ', ' Non-exudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' dry age-related macular degeneration ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Speed ', ' Prevention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Supplementation ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' prototype ', ' screening ', ' care costs ', ' Injections ', ' remote screening ', ' ']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2021,108049
"CRCNS: Multiple Time Scale Memory Consolidation in Neural Networks Detailed description of the proposed use of the animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and number to be used; Dissociated, primary cultures will be prepared from the cortex of new born mice of either sex (mus musculus, Postnatal day 0-1). These experiments will be performed using pups obtained from Vglut1-IRES2-Cre strains mated with Floxopatch (Lou et al., 2016) strains so that pyramidal cells will express channel rhodopsin CheRiff and voltage indicator QuasR2. Up to 5 cultures can be grown, which can be used for 5 experiments. Justification for the use of animals, choice of species, and numbers to be used; Description of procedures for minimizing discomfort, distress, pain, and injury; and Method of euthanasia and the reasons for its selection. Transgenic mice (category C) will be used because the experiments rely on the expression of CheRiff and QuasR2 for optical stimulation/recording. There are no alternative species.  All experiments are terminal. Newborn mice will be cooled in ice prior to cervical dislocation and excision of the brain for culture preparation. All procedures are in accordance with guideleines of the NYU Animal Welfare Committee.  The estimated number of animals below ensure that we have a continuous supply of cultures to perform experiments on a daily basis. Based on our experience in the past 3 years, each postnatal day 0-1 (P0-P1) mouse will generate at least 5 culture preparations. A viable culture will have a have a high density of neurons that express the Floxopatch construct, which varies from mouse to mouse. Thus, if one culture is not viable, all cultures derived from that mouse are also unusable. The success rate is approximately 50%. Because cultures can be made only form P0-1 day old mice and because it is not possible to determine whether expression is sufficient until the day of the experiment 2-3 weeks later, we will need to make 2 sets of cultures per week. Thus, we will need to maintain 2 breeding pairs per week or 8 breeding pairs per month to have a continuous supply of cultures. The breeding pairs will either consist of wildtype mice (for viral injection) or Vglut1-IRES2-Cre - Gt(ROSA)26Sor (floxopatch) mice. Breeding pairs will be replaced every six months. Total animals for experiments: 32 mice/year (=16 mice (8 breeding pairs) x 2/year replacement of breeding pairs). To maintain the 3 lines, 2 males and 2 females each of Vglut1-IRES2-Cre, Gt(ROSA)26Sor, and wildtype mice will be kept in separate cages (4+4+4=12 mice total). Every 6 months (twice per year), the mice of each type will be bred. From their offsprings, 4 males and 4 females from each line will be weaned and kept in separated cages as above (4+ 4 + 4 = 12) and the 4 original breeding pairs (12 mice) euthanized. Overall, 24 mice/year will be used to maintain the lines. Total mice/year: 56 (=24 mice/year to maintain lines + 32 mice/year for experiment). Total mice over 3 years = 168 mice.

"Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation, affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this population is critical to prevent psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. To improve clinically relevant predictive models, several issues need to be addressed: 1) to focus on outcomes beyond psychosis; 2) to take into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) to integrate data sets with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms. To address these challenges, the Accelerated Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP SCZ) study will collect diverse multi-modal data via two research networks (PRESCIENT and ProNET – 42 acquisition sites) in conjunction with the Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center (PREDICT-DPACC). The ultimate goal is to identify new CHR biomarkers, and CHR subtypes that will enhance future clinical trials and lead to effective new treatments. The PREDICT-DPACC is tasked with, 1) providing collaborative management, direction, data processing and coordination for the two research networks; and 2) developing and applying advanced algorithms to identify biomarkers that predict outcomes, in addition to stratifying CHR into subtypes based on outcome trajectories. The PREDICT-DPACC team will include multiple data types and will address the needs of the CHR research networks and the overall AMP SCZ goals. Data will be rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Planned analysis methods will be powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced clinical researchers. This supplement will allow the PREDICT-DPACC team to address unexpected personnel effort needs to meet the goals set forth in the original grant submission, including, but not limited to, 1) two networks with separate and independent data capture systems that need separate development of software tools to aggregate data, which involves twice the effort to install, test, and deploy tools on their infrastructure for each network; 2) coordination with both networks to ensure that the forms and data dictionaries match across networks and with the NIMH National Data Archive; 3) the study dashboard needs to be customized further to meet the visualization needs of both networks; 4) the inclusion of additional healthy controls, and co-enrollment requirements also deviate from what was expected and complicates the proposed analytic approaches; 5) there is also participation in additional unexpected organizational activities such as team workgroups, which will continue and are needed to harmonize ideas, methods, and approaches to meet AMP SCZ goals. The supplement will fill in gaps that could not have been anticipated at the start of this study and will allow us to meet the scientific goals which have not changed. NARRATIVE The “Clinical High Risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome in young people represents an opportune window for early intervention to prevent the onset of psychosis and other disorders, and to forestall disability; however, both the clinical heterogeneity and the paucity of biomarkers have hampered the development of effective intervention. To address these challenges, we will work with NIMH staff, and key stakeholders, including private- public partners and the research networks, to harmonize, aggregate, guide, and coordinate the collection of new data across the two research networks (n=42 sites worldwide), in order to develop biomarker algorithms that can predict individual trajectories for diverse outcomes and lead to drug development and treatment tailored to more homogeneous CHR subjects. The supplement will allow us to meet unanticipated increased effort of personnel needed to meet the goals set forth in original grant submission, including, but not limited to, supporting the inclusion of two independent research networks and increased coordination between networks.","Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing,

"Multiplexed imaging of viral protein processing and assembly in live cells Project Summary Imaging the full lifecycle of viral proteins in vivo is essential for understanding the molecular processes underlying viral infection. Live-cell imaging has long been performed using fluorescent protein fusion tags such as GFP. However, these tags can alter the size and function of targeted proteins. Furthermore, slow maturation, degradation, and photobleaching of tags results in the loss of signal, making it difficult to track the early life and ultimate fate of many proteins. Viral polyproteins, in particular, remain refractory to imaging in vivo due to their hypersensitivity to tags and the extensive processing and assembly they undergo during viral biogenesis. The use of linear epitope tags reversibly labeled by genetically encoded live-cell probes can solve many of these issues. Unfortunately, engineering functional probes for live-cell imaging of epitopes has been costly and time-consuming. In the proposed research, we combine expertise in protein engineering, single- molecule microscopy, and biochemistry to refine and accelerate the rational design of orthogonal epitope/probe pairs for highly multiplexed imaging of full viral protein lifecycles in living cells. We demonstrate the power of our strategy in our Preliminary Data by creating novel scFvs that bind the commonly used HA and Flag epitopes with high affinity in a variety of demanding live-cell imaging scenarios. In Aim 1, we will use our tested strategy to develop scFv against additional viral epitope tags and validate their utility in imaging experiments. To identify chimeric scFv that are both soluble and active within the cellular milieu, we will graft known epitope-specific CDR loops onto a unique panel of stable scFv scaffolds. In Aim 2, we will use state-of- the-art computational protein modeling and design to develop novel predictive binding models for scFv:viral- epitope complexes, establish and test protocols for de novo scFv design, engineer large scFv libraries encoding multiple new peptide-binding solutions, and screen using phage display. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of our newly developed scFv in live-cell imaging experiments by probing several critical aspects of viral biology. Specifically, we will use our engineered scFv to visualize and quantify the translation dynamics of flavivirus transmembrane polyproteins, and to monitor alphavirus particle assembly kinetics. Overall, this project will provide a powerful new pipeline for generating scFv proteins that can track viral proteins in living cells. The reagents we generate will provide the virus molecular biology community with new, versatile imaging tools to better illuminate many important biological processes. Project Narrative Conventional technology for intracellular imaging of viral proteins is limited in spatial and temporal resolution. This project will generate next-generation genetically encoded probe proteins that allow scientists to image when a given segment of a viral protein emerges from the ribosome, and observe when that segment moves or is buried during viral protein assembly. These tags will be used to image previously inaccessible processes, including viral polyprotein translation and homo-oligomerization of viral capsid proteins.",Multiplexed imaging of viral protein processing and assembly in live cells,10455219,R56AI155897,"['Alphavirus ', ' Alpha Virus ', ' Group A Arboviruses ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Biology ', ' Capsid ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chimera organism ', ' Chimera ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Crystallization ', ' Engineering ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Flavivirus ', ' Group B Arbovirus ', ' Genome ', ' Hand ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Immunoglobulin Fragments ', ' Antibody Fragments ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Microscopy ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Peptides ', ' Polyproteins ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Recombinant Proteins ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Ribosomes ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Viral Proteins ', ' Viral Gene Products ', ' Viral Gene Proteins ', ' virus protein ', ' Viral Structural Proteins ', ' virology ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus Replication ', ' viral multiplication ', ' viral replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' Virus ', ' Chimeric Proteins ', ' Chimera Protein ', ' Fusion Protein ', ' Label ', ' Refractory ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Genetic Materials ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Viral ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' particle ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' Modeling ', ' single molecule ', ' model design ', ' Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Outer Coat Protein ', ' Capsid Proteins ', ' Photobleaching ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Homo ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Molecular Virology ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Replication-Associated Process ', ' Replication Process ', ' in vivo ', ' Phage Display ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Consumption ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' live cell imaging ', ' live cell image ', ' live cellular image ', ' live cellular imaging ', ' live cell microscopy ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' ']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,517692
"Development of a Predictive Frailty Clock & Longitudinal Investigation of its Epigenetic Determinants Project summary/abstract Longevity studies in mice are expensive and time-consuming, and there are currently no measures that can predict mortality in a mouse at an earlier time-point. Additionally, there are very few measures of the overall health of mice that can be assessed longitudinally. In humans, frailty can predict mortality with greater power than the DNA methylation clock. In my early postdoctoral work I have validated a mouse frailty index, that increases with age, is associated with mortality and age-related pathologies, and is sensitive to interventions. In the Sinclair lab I have used machine learning modelling of this mouse frailty index to make the Analysis of Frailty in Death (AFRAID) clock that can predict the lifespan of male C57BL/6 mice aged 21 months or older with accuracy of approximately 1.7 months. We hypothesis that a frailty clock that includes a range of measures including physiological and molecular measures (blood-based Analysis of Frailty in Death, bAFRAID) will accurately predict lifespan in younger, female mice of a different strain. To test this hypothesis I will complete a battery of health assessments, including blood collection for novel peptide biomarker detection, in male and female UM-HET3 mice every 3 months from 15 months of age until death. I will use regression modelling of all measured outcomes to develop an optimized `bAFRAID clock' that predicts time to death in mice. I will complete this part of the project at Harvard Medical School in the lab of Dr David Sinclair, who will act as my mentor and is an internationally recognised expert in the biology of aging. I will receive additional training in biomarker modelling and peptidomics from experts Drs Steve Horvath and Steve Gygi. For the independent phase of this award, I will use longitudinal assessments, and cutting-edge epigenetic tools to investigate the relationship between epigenetic changes and the AFRAID clock. This will increase our understanding of whether epigenetic mechanisms underly the onset of frailty in aging. The completion of this project and the proposed training will position me in an ideal position to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent researcher with a lab focused on understanding the mechanisms of frailty in aging. Project Narrative This project aims to develop a new tool to assess the overall health of a mouse and predict early in a mouse's life when it will die.

"Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis Project Summary After nearly five decades of human voice research, much remains unknown regarding muscle control mechanism of voice production. Studies confirmed that vocal fold pre-phonatory posture (geometry, position, tension and stiffness) is among the primary factors controlling vocal fold vibratory dynamics and voice type. However, very limited data is available on muscle control of these properties, primarily due to experimental difficulties. Muscle control of glottic geometry and dynamics has been studied in in vivo human and animal models, but these studies were limited to an endoscopic superior view, thus cannot to provide 3D deformation/movement of the vocal folds. Moreover, tension and stiffness of the vocal fold tissues are very difficult to obtain in vivo due to a lack of reliable techniques. A significant knowledge gap remains regarding how intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILMs) control voice production through vocal fold posturing as well as how ILM dysfunctions, such as vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP), affect voice production by altering vocal fold posturing. In this project, we propose to use an innovative approach that integrates experimental data and state-of-the-art computer modeling techniques to produce a complete dataset of 3D vocal fold postures (geometry, position, tension, stiffness), 3D vocal fold vibratory dynamics, and voice outcomes in the full muscle control space including symmetric, asymmetric and compensative muscle activations. The PI’s group recently developed a state-of-the-art, physics based, 3D computer model that integrates realistic laryngeal anatomy, physiologically quantifiable inputs, inverse material parameterization and machine learning for simulating vocal fold posturing and flow-structure-acoustics interaction (FSAI) during voice production. For this project, we propose to combine this embodied model with experimental data to generate a holistic view of vocal fold posturing and FSAI with great temporal and spatial details in the full muscle control space. In particular, the model will reveal the 3D complexity of vocal fold postures and vibrations and provide measures of tension and stiffness with muscle activations, which have not been available. We propose to use the dataset to elucidate causal links among muscle activity, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold vibration and voice outcome. Muscle combinations with distinct posturing, vibration and acoustic patterns will be identified. The new knowledge is expected to elucidate the muscle control mechanism of voice production through vocal fold posturing. The proposed work has the potential to improve insight into the function and dysfunction of the ILMs and to serve as a foundation for novel, targeted therapeutic approaches. We hope to develop possible biomechanical metrics for the diagnosis and optimal methodology for treatment of VFP. Project Narrative Vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP) is the most common etiology of voice disorders which affects 9% of the U.S. population. Diagnosis and optimal treatment of VFP remain challenging because of incomplete understanding of muscle control mechanism of vocal fold posturing and vibration.

"Circulating Plasma Metabolites, Lifestyle Factors, and Mortality Risk PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-throughput metabolomic studies have shown promise in elucidating potential pathways underpinning aging processes and longevity. However, data in human populations are still constrained by small sample sizes and a limited number of metabolites profiled. Existing studies have also not integrated data on diet and lifestyle to evaluate the associations of interest in a comprehensive manner. A better understanding of aging- related metabolic alterations and whether metabolite profiles are modulated by lifestyle factors is crucial to develop effective strategies to promote health and well-being. The main goal is to identify novel metabolite profiles associated with mortality and prolonged longevity, and investigate whether the metabolomic signatures of lifestyle factors are associated with mortality and longevity. We propose to leverage unique resources from two large U.S. cohorts with long follow-up and extended lifespan data: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) (n~8,100). The results will be replicated in two independent populations: the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) (n~2,300), and the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) Study (n~3,000), a population at high cardiovascular risk in Spain. This research application is aimed at: (1) identifying plasma metabolomic profiles and networks associated with mortality and longevity; and, (2) identifying the metabolomic signatures of a healthy lifestyle score and examining its prospective association with mortality and longevity. The proposed project is built on the numerous strengths of existing cohort studies in U.S. and Mediterranean populations, and supporting results from the preliminary work conducted by our multi- disciplinary team. Findings from this study will provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of longevity and advance our understanding of how plasma metabolomics may mediate the associations between lifestyle factors and mortality risk. The proposed research will generate new knowledge that can directly inform specific lifestyle interventions applicable in clinical settings to improve the health and well-being of adults as they age. The proposed research will provide a wealth of preliminary data to stimulate further research on longevity and healthy aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to leverage unique resources with longitudinal data to identify metabolite profiles and networks associated with total mortality and longevity, and investigate whether the metabolomic signatures of a healthy lifestyle score are associated with the risk of mortality and longevity, in U.S. and Mediterranean populations. This study has the potential to identify novel metabolic signatures of both mortality and longevity and improve our understanding of how lifestyle factors modulate metabolites and mortality risk, which can help to design better preventive and intervention strategies.","Circulating Plasma Metabolites, Lifestyle Factors, and Mortality Risk",10298057,R21AG070375,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lipids ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' mortality ', ' Oxidation-Reduction ', ' Redox ', ' oxidation reduction reaction ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Spain ', ' Supervision ', ' Work ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Sample Size ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Adherence ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Health Professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' healthy aging ', ' effective intervention ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ', ' lifestyle data ', ' life-style data ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' secondary analysis ', ' never smoking ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2021,239250
"Global and Local Genetic Ancestry Impacts on Differential Outcome of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Multiple Sclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of our study is to identify ancestry related genetic variants contributing to differential risk of manifestations of both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS) in subjects of different genetic ancestries. SLE is an autoimmune disease with heterogenous features characterized by autoantibody formation and MS is an immune-mediated, demyelinating disorder. We will investigate the association between genetic ancestry and clinical outcomes of SLE and MS that are known to differ in prevalence and severity between SLE or MS patients of different races. Outcomes for SLE will include age of onset, autoantibody status, and lupus nephritis. Outcomes for MS will include age of onset, cognitive impairment, and MS severity score. We will study ~4,000 SLE and MS cases. In Aim 1, we will use ~2,000 SLE cases from the UCSF Lupus Genetics Study and California Lupus Epidemiology Study (CLUES) and ~2,000 MS cases from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) MS Research Program and Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) MS Sunshine Study to investigate the association of global ancestry and the outcomes of interest for SLE and MS. In Aim 2, we will investigate the association of local ancestry genome-wide and of candidate SLE and MS SNPs with the same clinical outcomes. In Aim 3, we will test for the association between both active and passive tobacco smoking and respective outcomes as well as test for gene-environment interaction between active and passive smoking and global and local ancestry. By establishing whether global and local genetic ancestry contribute to clinical heterogeneity and severity of SLE and MS, or if there are differences in gene-environment interaction with environmental exposures such as smoking, we might be able to target patients based on risk of disease outcomes by evaluating genetic ancestry of admixed patients. It might also be possible to predict disease manifestations and allow for early intervention and improved targeted treatment strategies limiting severity of disease and improving quality of life. This research project and associated training plan were developed in collaboration with my sponsor, Dr. Lisa Barcellos, co-sponsors, Drs. Lindsey Criswell and Laura Fejerman, and collaborators, Drs. Andres Cardenas and Priya Moorjani. The training plan emphasizes scientific productivity and building a strong knowledge of epidemiologic, biostatistical, and computational methods, as well as immunology and SLE and MS autoimmune disease processes. As a student at UC Berkeley, I am well supported by an institution that values rigorous scientific research and have access to many research and professional resources. Ultimately, the proposed research and achievement of the goals outlined in the training plan will allow me to become a multidisciplinary, independent investigator and facilitate my transition into a post-doctoral position and early-investigator faculty or research position. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS) have debilitating clinical features which vary between different ancestral populations. Since disease manifestations may differ by genetic ancestry, understanding the effect of genetic ancestry and interactions with active and passive tobacco smoking exposure on clinical outcomes of SLE and MS is an important step towards predicting disease outcomes and allowing for early intervention and treatment for different ancestral populations.",Global and Local Genetic Ancestry Impacts on

"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10320271,R44EY031202,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Color ', ' Counseling ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Ear ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fees ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incentives ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' New York ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optometry ', ' Optometries ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sales ', ' Savings ', ' Smoking ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Vitamins ', ' Specialist ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Java ', ' Pythons ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' Atrophic AMD ', ' Atrophic age-related macular degeneration ', ' Dry AMD ', ' Non-exudative age-related macular degeneration ', ' dry age-related macular degeneration ', ' Trademark ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' developed country ', ' developed nation ', ' developed nations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Visit ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup ', ' checkup examination ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Speed ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Druse ', ' Drusen ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' solar exposure ', ' sun light exposure ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Supplementation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' prospective ', ' user-friendly ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' photobiomodulation ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' screening ', ' Learning Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' software as a service ', ' care costs ', ' Injections ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' sociodemographic factors ', ' socio-demographic factors ', ' remote screening ', ' ']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2021,45000
"Structural, Biochemical and Functional Connectivity in Osteoarthritis using Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Skeletal Biomechanics Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease that causes joint degeneration, affects 27 million U.S. adults, and often leads to severe disability. The prevalence of OA is 33.6% in adults older than 65 years. Despite the fact that OA is a widespread and debilitating disease, treatment options are currently extremely limited, and established disease-modifying therapies do not exist. The solution generally offered to treat late stage, symptomatic knee OA is joint replacement (total knee/hip arthroplasty, TKA/THA), and while this surgically invasive and expensive remedy offers temporary relief, replacements often fail after 10-15 years, with shorter life spans in obese individuals. In order to reduce the number of TKA/THA procedures, preventive efforts and interventions targeting early stage OA are essential – the first step would be identifying subjects at high risk for disease development, at a stage when tissue is not yet lost, and cartilage matrix abnormalities are potentially reversible. Understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint interactions, impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA.  Hip OA progression marked by changes in cartilage biochemistry has complex multi-joint interactions with several mechanistic factors, including morphological features, gait biomechanics and demographics. However, studies to date have mostly focused on the relationship between single mechanistic factors and semi-quantitative/ quantitative imaging measures, gait biomechanics, or non-objective symptomatic evidence of hip OA. The overall goal of this competitive renewal is to extend our longitudinal work to determine the structure-function-connectivity and mechanistic factors that mediate biochemical degeneration of hip cartilage associated with OA progression over the mid-term (6-8-year) period.  In this proposal, subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our existing cohort (n=184 hips, 92 subjects), with the availability of existing 3-year follow-up data including bi- lateral hip radiographs and MR images, gait biomechanics and patient reported outcomes. We will use novel, fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based T1ρ and T2 relaxation time on a voxel basis, which will provide precise and localized information on cartilage proteoglycan and collagen integrity and water content. Automatic segmentation techniques combined with machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze cartilage T1ρ/T2 in a well-characterized dataset with quantifiable T1ρ/T2 values on a voxel-level, and to automatically detect the patterns of focal T1ρ/T2 elevations that lead to later stage OA and drive progression of degenerative disease (over 8 years). Detailed analysis of gait biomechanics using functional principal component analysis will utilize the rich skeletal biomechanics data and imaging (over 8 years). Imaging the knee and hip longitudinally will provide a multi-joint analysis of OA progression (over 4 years) not done previously and will provide unique insights in the mechanisms in hip OA, connections with knee changes. Osteoarthritis (OA), a multifactorial disease and understanding the complex pathophysiology of joint degeneration, knee and hip joint interactions, and the impact of gait biomechanics, are all critical to determine the mechanistic basis of hip OA. In this proposal subjects will be recruited for a longitudinal study (covering 5-8 year follow up) from our existing cohort and we will use novel, fully automated and translational methods to measure MRI-based measures of cartilage degeneration and determine the role of gait biomechanics on disease progression.","Structural, Biochemical and Functional Connectivity in Osteoarthritis using

"Efficient nonparametric estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in causal inference PROJECT SUMMARY In nearly all studies of comparative effectiveness, the investigators seek to estimate how an in- tervention changes outcomes on average. That is, are outcomes for treated subjects better on average than for untreated subjects? While the average treatment effect (ATE) is a useful sum- mary of the treatment effect, the treatment effect may vary from patient to patient. The ATE is a low-dimensional summary of a treatment effect, since it summarizes the overall effect of the treatment using a single quantitative measure and ignores possible effect heterogeneity. Many in- vestigators seek to go beyond low-dimensional summaries by estimating heterogenous treatment effects (HTEs). The most common approach to the estimation of HTEs relies on simple statistical methods. Specifically, regression models are widely used but may be biased due to the linear functional form especially where HTEs that are nonlinear or based on complex combinations of patient subgroups. Currently, there is considerable interest in developing more flexible methods for the estimation of the HTEs. In this project, we will use the the doubly robust machine learning (DRML) framework to develop improved methods for a variety of HTEs. The DRML framework is a combination of semiparametric theory, machine learning (ML) methods, and doubly robust estimators.

"A precision medicine approach to improve prediction of severe toxicity in fluorouracil chemotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My long-term goal is to improve the toxicity profiles for cancer therapeutics. One-third of cancer patients treated with the commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) experience severe and life- threatening toxicity to standard doses of the drug. An appreciable fraction of those patients die—not due to cancer, but because of side-effects related to treatment. Clinical studies indicate that the majority of patients who experience severe toxicity to 5-FU are deficient for an enzyme called dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, DPYD gene); however, only four genetic variants in DPYD have been adequately characterized to be considered predictive of 5-FU toxicity in clinical studies. My preliminary studies demonstrate that these four variants explain only a small fraction of severe 5-FU toxicities and have exceedingly limited clinical value outside of individuals with European ancestry. The primary objective of the studies proposed in this grant application is to identify additional biomarkers of 5-FU toxicity risk that can be used to individualize 5-FU dosing with the goal of improving the safety profile for the drug. My overall hypothesis is that expanded biomarker-based pre-treatment tests will more accurately identify patients with DPD deficiency, as well as the relative degree to which the DPD function is impaired, enabling more accurate dose optimization. My rationale is that improved biomarker-based approaches to dose individualization have strong potential to improve the safety profile for this commonly used therapeutic. Aim #1 will identify risk alleles for severe 5-FU–related toxicity in understudied populations. Aim #2 will characterize multi-marker haplotype contributions to 5-FU toxicity. In Aim #3, I will develop an integrated predictive model of 5-FU toxicity using deep machine learning. It is my expectation that the proposed studies, which will leverage multiple large patient and volunteer data and specimen collections to address various aspects of my primary hypothesis, will answer key questions that have vexed pharmacogenetics researchers for decades. In doing so, the proposed studies are expected to identify clinically relevant biomarkers that can be used to improve the safety profile of 5-FU through dose optimization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Improved predictive tests for 5-FU toxicity risk, coupled with a clear indication of the clinical validity of such tests, is relevant to public health because it is expected to reduce the number and severity of adverse drug reactions, improve treatment efficacy, and lower the overall financial burden for cancers treated with 5-FU. Collectively, this is expected to optimize longer-term systemic therapy and minimize toxicity with an overall improvement in quality of life for cancer patients.",A precision medicine approach to improve prediction of severe toxicity in fluorouracil chemotherapy,10295231,R01CA251065,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Fluorouracil ', ' 5-FU ', ' 5-Fluracil ', ' 5FU ', ' Fluoro Uracil ', ' Fluoruracil ', ' Fluouracil ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Incidence ', ' Masks ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Western Europe ', ' Work ', ' Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase ', ' Dihydrothymine Dehydrogenase (NADP) ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Reaction ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' DPYD gene ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Systemic Therapy ', ' SYS-TX ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' chemotherapy ', ' volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' side effect ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' medication safety ', ' drug safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' dose individualization ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,363713
"Using three-dimensional protein networks to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in infectious disease Using three-dimensional protein networks to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in  infectious disease CHALLENGE: Over the past decade, technologies for deep profiling of the human immune system, both in the context of natural and vaccine-mediated immunity, have become readily available. These approaches have generated a wide range of molecular profiles across infectious disease contexts. However, existing studies primarily focus on individual `omic datasets, and do not take into account the underlying molecular networks. Thus, the primary emphasis has been on uncovering predictive biomarkers, but these biomarkers may often be correlative surrogates and have little or no connection with the underlying molecular phenotypes driving disease pathophysiology. GOAL I propose to develop and use a novel framework to integrate genomic data with three-dimensional (3D) structurally-resolved protein networks to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in infectious disease. While protein networks are typically viewed as two-dimensional, with proteins as nodes and interactions between them as edges, this simplifying representation fails to take into account the 3D structures of the proteins themselves, and the corresponding interaction interfaces. My past work has demonstrated the critical importance of taking into account corresponding structural information in the integration of Mendelian mutations with protein networks, to elucidate molecular phenotypes underlying the corresponding genetic disorders, with high sensitivity and specificity. Here, I propose to develop a novel framework that integrates structural genomic data with host-pathogen protein interactome networks to generate 3D host-pathogen interactomes. These 3D interactome networks are then integrated with host (human) genetic data to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in HIV and influenza. INNOVATION AND IMPACT: The proposed work integrates both two orthogonal facets of my expertise in network systems biology and machine learning, and pushes the envelope on multiple key frontiers. First, it provides a novel framework for the integration of host genetic data with host-pathogen protein networks. Second, a key novelty is the incorporation of structural information corresponding to host-pathogen protein interaction interfaces to refine the traditional principle of “guilt-by-association”, and hone in on specific molecular phenotypes that modulate infectious disease risk. The identified molecular phenotypes will generate key mechanistic hypotheses regarding corresponding disease pathophysiology, and help design interventional strategies. Finally, while the focus here is to use this approach in HIV and influenza, the framework itself is generalizable and can be used across infectious disease contexts. Project Narrative I propose to develop and use a novel framework to integrate host genetic data with three-dimensional structurally-resolved host-pathogen protein networks to uncover immuno-modulatory molecular phenotypes in infectious disease. The incorporation of structural information provides a significant refinement over the traditional principle of “guilt-by-association”, and allows us to hone in on specific molecular phenotypes that modulate infectious disease risk.

"Developing an ultrafast fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy system for retinal imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that affects the central part of the retina and leads to impairments in central vision and sharp vision. According to the report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, AMD affects ~0.8% of people in US between 50 and 60, 1.5% between 60 and 70, ~4.8% between 70 and 80, and nearly 12% over 80 years old. Fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) has become an important tool in retinal diagnosis as it provides critical information about retina that the traditional fundus autofluorescence microscopy cannot provide. Whereas more demonstrations of FLIO in retina diagnosis at different stages of AMD have been shown in recent years, FLIO has not reached widespread use in clinics due to a number of fundamental limitations. Here we are developing an ultrafast fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy (uFLIO) system for rapid acquisition of retinal fundus autofluorescence and reconstruction of fluorescence lifetime images around the posterior pole of retina. The acquired autofluorescence lifetime information will help us understand the states of the endogenous fluorophores within the retina, and their roles and changes during the development of retinal diseases.

"Deep learning to enable the genetic analysis of aorta Project Summary / Abstract Aortic disease is an important contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and sudden death. Key discoveries, including identification of the causal gene for Marfan’s syndrome (FBN1), have advanced our knowledge of syndromic aneurysm and dissection, but to date there remains insufficient information on sporadic thoracic aortic disease. For example, despite growing knowledge of the importance of aortic disease, there is no guideline for screening for ascending aortic disease, and no therapy to treat its underlying molecular mechanisms. While there is likely some overlap between thoracic and abdominal aortic disease, they are embryologically distinct and likely have different genetic and clinical risk factors. In Dr. Pirruccello’s preliminary work, he developed an automated deep learning model to quantify the diameter of the thoracic aorta using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). He applied the model in the UK Biobank and conducted a genome-wide association study for the diameter of ascending and descending thoracic aorta in nearly 40,000 participants. These results cemented the feasibility of the approach of (1) training deep learning models to extract biologically relevant information from imaging, and (2) conducting genetic analyses on these deep learning model-based phenotypes. This now paves the way for a more comprehensive analysis of additional aortic traits, and downstream evaluation of genetic risk factors for both thoracic and abdominal aortic disease. First, Dr. Pirruccello proposes to develop models for additional aortic traits including thoracic aortic strain and distensibility, and abdominal aortic diameter. Second, after developing additional models to extract those features, Dr. Pirruccello proposes to conduct genetic analyses on these traits in the UK Biobank, elucidating the common and rare genetic variation that leads to variability in the aorta’s size and distensibility at several levels. Third, he proposes to produce polygenic scores, permitting modeling of the clinical and genetic risk for abnormalities in aortic size and distensibility that may predispose to aortic aneurysm and dissection. This work will take place in the Division of Cardiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Dr. Pirruccello will perform this research under the mentorship of Dr. Patrick Ellinor, the Director of the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative at the Broad Institute, and Dr. Mark Lindsay, an expert in genetic aortic disease at the Massachusetts General Hospital Thoracic Aortic Center. Dr. Pirruccello’s goal is to become a computational cardiovascular geneticist with expertise in machine learning. He is dedicated to becoming an independent investigator and to use the research performed for the K08 as a springboard for an R01. Project Narrative Aortic disease is an important contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and sudden death.

"Next Generation Brain PET Imaging Abstract Gold-standard quantitative imaging studies are often difficult to implement, limited by financial and logistical issues, or expose the patient to unnecessary risks. Deep learning has shown great promise in recent years for many medical applications; one use is to synthesize improved images. Such image trans- formation methods offer the potential to improve the quality, value, and accessibility of medical imaging. The goal of this project is to develop deep convolutional neural network approaches to FDG PET imaging, the most commonly performed clinical brain- focused PET study in the USA. Using simultaneous PET/MRI, we will train networks to produce diagnostic PET images from ultra-low dose PET and MR images. We will explore the three reimbursed clinical indications for this imaging modality (tumor recurrence, dementia, and epilepsy) using both quantitative metrics and repeated reader studies to assess equivalence and evaluate possible AI generalization bias related to simultaneity, scanner type, age, gender, and disease prevalence. Next, we will evaluate whether we can move beyond ultra-low dose and remove the radiation dose altogether, synthesizing FDG brain PET images from MR inputs only, relying on the information in multi-modal functional MRI. Finally, we will assess whether we can use deep networks to combine imaging and non- imaging data such as clinical and genetic information to further improve image transformation and predict future images and image-based biomarkers. Significantly reducing or even eliminating the need for radiation to produce brain FDG PET images would be truly transformative while the ability to predict the future will enable personalized radiology and enhance our ability to perform clinical trials. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence methods, particularly deep learning, can be used to improve image quality or synthesize new images from existing data and to predict future imaging. We will apply this to determine its performance for brain metabolic imaging using simultaneous FDG brain PET/MRI in realistic clinical populations, significantly reducing or eliminating the radiotracer dose as well as incorporating non-imaging, clinical data to improve AI-based image synthesis.

"Ancient viral threats through the lens of adaptation in human genomes Project Summary The current SARS-COV2 pandemic has brought to light that more efforts are needed to evaluate the pandemic potential of viruses that can spill over in human populations. To assess the pandemic potential of specific viruses, over the next five years my lab will ask if similar viruses caused epidemics not only during the recent documented past, but during the much longer time scale of human evolution. Viruses that caused epidemics in the past are indeed the most likely to cause epidemics again in the future, and hundreds of viral epidemics likely plagued human populations during their evolution. This work will fill gaps in knowledge on epidemics in ancestral human populations, and by doing so, will enable a better assessment of the viruses that represent a future pandemic threat.  To study ancient epidemics, my lab will exploit host genomic adaptation driven by ancient viruses. Arms races with viruses have shaped the host immune system by driving a large number of adaptations. I recently showed that viruses left abundant signals of adaptation not only in immune genes, but across the entire human genome. The lab will examine signals of adaptation left by specific viruses in human genomes, to detect, date, and functionally characterize ancient epidemics. To this aim, we will develop new statistical tools based on recent advances in machine learning and in the reconstruction of Ancestral Recombination Graphs (ARGs). These new approaches with increased power to detect and date genomic adaptation will allow us to ask the following questions: 1) Which viruses drove ancient epidemics in human evolution? My lab will create deep learning tests with high power to detect complex genomic adaptation within the past ~200,000 years of human evolution. 2) When did specific viruses drive ancient epidemics? We will use ARGs and Approximate Bayesian Computation to date ancient epidemics, by dating the host adaptive events driven by specific viruses. 3) Which functional host genetic changes were selected during ancient epidemics, in which genes, and how do they influence genetic susceptibility to present viruses? We will investigate regulatory adaptation to viruses and the overall impact of virus-driven host adaptation on the genetic susceptibility of different human populations to specific present viruses, thereby providing virologists with strong candidate host genes for further inquiry.  My lab is uniquely suited to decipher ancient epidemics by linking host-pathogen interactions together with the latest developments in the population genomics of adaptation. Project narrative Arms races with viruses have shaped human genomic adaptation, not only in immune genes, but also across the entire human genome. Over the coming years, my lab will exploit host genomic adaptation to detect, date, and functionally characterize ancient viral epidemics that plagued ancestral human populations.

"Rapid response for pandemics: single cell sequencing and deep learning to predict antibody sequences against an emerging antigen ABSTRACT One of the “holy grails” in immunology is to be able to directly predict tight-binding variable chain antibody sequences in silico against foreign or non-self `antigenic' proteins. Immunoglobulin chain rearrangement can potentially encode approximately 1016 different variants of antibody heavy and light chain sequences. However, only a small fraction of the sequence space is generally accessed for evolving antibodies against foreign proteins. The computational challenge is to go from a model of the structure of an antigen to predicting a set of antibody chain sequences that can bind tightly to the antigen. If solved, it might be possible to move in less than 24 hours from the first cryo-electron-microscopic structure of a novel viral protein to advance a set of potent antibody-like molecular candidates for testing. Towards solving this problem, this project aims to develop a deep learning architecture that will take as input thermodynamic, quantum mechanical (density functional), and local structure- based network topographical features of the antigens and their cognate antibodies, and will output their respective binding affinity constants. We will design a generative adversarial network (GAN), which we think is uniquely suited for regression-based ML approaches for the immune system, to discover associations between the epitope and the variable chain features. This approach requires a large data stream of antigen and cognate antibody sequences, which until recently was difficult to obtain. A recently described single B-cell receptor (BCR) specific tagging method coupled with single cell deep sequencing (“linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing” or LIBRA- seq) can rapidly isolate and sequence the BCR variable chain coding regions that can bind with high selectivity to antigenic epitopes. Towards the specific project goals, in Task 1, LIBRA-seq will be used to rapidly identify and generate candidate immunoglobulin coding sequences in response to specific linear and nonlinear epitopes (against controls), chosen through computational/molecular modeling and prioritized with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein epitopes (but not restricted to these), injected into a mouse model, to generate large training sets; in Task 2, these training sets, along with other data sets already available in public databases, will generate a series of structural features (described above), which will be used to train the GAN; in Task 3, the predicted epitope-antibody interactions will be validated by direct experiments with synthetic antibody and phage-display systems. Thus, the proposed strategy combines foundational principles in evolutionary biology, genomics, structural chemistry, and computer science to the solution of a general biological engineering problem. Results from this project are expected to lay the foundations for a rigorously tested and fully automated machine- learning system that could rapidly generate synthetic antibody candidates from the structure of a novel virus protein, which can enhance the rapid response ability against a future pandemic. The ability to develop targeted antibody therapy against non-infectious or chronic diseases, and on the production of antibody-based industrial enzymes, will also be dramatically enhanced if this project were to be successful. The team: The team-leads of this multi-institutional research project comprise a computer scientist, a protein crystallographer, an immunologist, and a molecular biologist. 1 NARRATIVE The readiness for a future viral pandemic will critically depend on being able to accurately predict, entirely using computers, neutralizing antibody structures directly from the virus's protein structure. Vaccines and therapeutics can then be manufactured and tested with unprecedented rapidity. We propose to make this goal a reality by engaging the advantages of single-cell genomic deep sequencing and the latest advances in deep machine learning.",Rapid response for pandemics: single cell

"Clinical glaucoma management enabled by visible-light OCT Project Summary This collaborative technology focused project seeks to develop, characterize, and validate visible-light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT) as a functional tool to transform the clinical management of glaucoma. We will address two unmet needs in clinical glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression: (1) the ability to measure retinal sublayer structure and (2) to accurately assess local retinal hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sO2). The earliest structural changes in glaucoma are thought to be a retraction of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrites in the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Specifically, this would occur in the outer IPL, where RGC “off” cells synapse. Identification of loss of synapses, either by decreased scattering or by the change in IPL sublayers’ thicknesses, could serve as an earlier and more sensitive biomarker for glaucoma than any other. Measuring retinal sO2 and specific arteriole-venule couplets can determine the oxygen extraction in the regions served by those vessels. Our preliminary data indicate that regions showing damage in glaucomatous eyes have lower oxygen extraction than similar areas in healthy eyes. Our observation suggests that such oxygen extraction abnormalities can be measured well beyond the “floor effect” threshold noted with conventional OCT, allowing assessment of disease beyond the time point that conventional structural OCT becomes insensitive. To achieve our long-term goal, we will focus on new vis-OCT optical system design, imaging protocols, and data processing methodologies to identify both metabolic and ultra-fine anatomical alternations in early glaucoma, both of which are beyond the capabilities of existing imaging technologies. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a new clinical imaging modality, referred to as visible-light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT), to improve the clinical care of glaucoma.

"Developing tools for the unbiased analysis and visualization of scRNA-seq data ABSTRACT Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides genome-wide information about gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. The unprecedented scope of these data is revolutionizing our understanding of development and tissue homeostasis as well as diseases like cancer. A major issue with scRNA-seq, however, is the shear scale of the data, consisting of ~20,000 gene expression measurements in thousands to millions of cells. Effective computational approaches are clearly required to translate data of this size and complexity into actionable biological insights. For instance, scRNA-seq data are approximately 20,000-dimensional, and as a result all available analysis pipelines rely on multiple dimensionality reduction steps. This usually entails a combination of linear tools like PCA and non-linear techniques like t-SNE and UMAP. The data is generally reduced to between 10- and 100-D for data analysis (e.g. clustering into distinct cell types) and 2-D for visualization. The problem, however, is that dimensionality reduction can lead to loss of information. We recently showed that this loss of information is dramatic: for any given cell, over 95% of its neighbors are changed in the process of dimensionality reduction. This complete change in the structure of the data can introduce significant noise and bias into the analysis, and suggests the critical need for alternative approaches. The premise of this application is that reducing bias in scRNA-seq data analysis will maximize our ability to extract meaningful information from the data. In this proposal, we focus on developing new algorithms to address three specific steps in the typical analysis pipeline: (1) Dimensionality Reduction: Our hypothesis is that deep neural networks can be explicitly trained to maximize the amount of information that can be retained for both data analysis and visualization. (2) Feature Selection: Not all genes are equally informative for downstream analyses, so researchers generally choose a subset of genes based on variation in the population. We have shown that standard approaches to selecting genes convolve true biological variation with technical noise from the experiment. We hypothesize that statistical models based on our understanding of sources of technical noise can be used to select more informative genes. (3) Cell clustering: Clustering the data to determine cell types is critical, but cells with different identities often form complex, overlapping geometries in gene expression space that are difficult for existing algorithms to resolve. Our hypothesis is that new clustering tools, guided by prior knowledge and leveraging innovations in clustering from image segmentation, can overcome this problem. We will build these new tools and test them against existing benchmark datasets and novel data generated by our experimental collaborators. We will also integrate these tools into popular scRNA-seq analysis packages. Successful completion of the proposed work will allow the field to extract more biologically relevant information from the burgeoning set of scRNA-seq datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides genome-wide information on gene expression at single-cell resolution, and is revolutionizing the progress of biomedical research. The size and complexity of this data necessitates the development of computational algorithms that can distill critical biological insights from high- dimensional datasets.

"Deep Learning Reconstruction for Improved TOF PET Using Histo-Image Partitioning Project Summary  Clinical and research applications of the PET imaging are rapidly expanding from ever improving diagnostic and treatment assessment applications to guidance of personalized treatments, ultra-low dose imaging, and even interventional imaging procedures. Supporting these developments, reconstruction tools that are able to reliably handle both typical and (ultra-)low count situations, imperfect data, and data from specialized imaging geometries, with fast (near real-time) reconstruction performance are of crucial importance. The overall goal of this project is to develop and investigate robust and efficacious Deep Learning (DL) reconstruction approaches addressing these needs. A unique and innovative feature of the proposed approaches (compared to alternative DL applications) is the utilization of list-mode data histogrammed into a very efficient histo-image format. TOF data partitioned into the histo-image format are characterized by strong local properties, thus perfectly fitting convolutional neural network formalism and making DL training and reconstruction directly from realistic clinical data (in size and character) highly feasible and practical.  The clinical utility of PET systems has significantly improved over the years thanks to advances in instrumentation, data corrections, and reconstruction approaches. Nevertheless, full utilization of their potential through robust and fast quantitative reconstruction remains a challenge especially for the cases of very low count data, such as in low-count temporal (motion and dynamic) frames, delayed studies, longitudinal low-dose studies, and studies using new isotopes with long half-life and low positron fraction rates (e.g. in 89Zr-labeled CAR-T cell imaging), as well as in specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage, for which exact, artifact-free, reconstruction does not exist. These are the situations for which the developed DL approaches promise great potential due to the demonstrated success of the DL networks to be trained for imperfect and very low count data without reliance on accurate data models. Furthermore, pre-trained networks can provide ultra- fast, near real-time, performance in practical use.  Specific Aim 1 will develop tools for DL PET reconstruction using histo-image partitioning along with procedures for training of the proposed DL approaches, including novel approaches advancing the state-of-the- art of DL reconstruction directly from acquired PET data. Specific Aim 2 is directed towards study and evaluation of the performance of the investigated DL approaches for whole-body and long axial FOV scanner data for the wide range of counts from applications such as typical FDG, low dose, delayed, low activity isotope scans, and ultra-short frames in motion correction and dynamic studies. Specific Aim 3 will develop and apply motion correction protocols involving the proposed DL reconstruction tools and test and study their efficacy for clinically realistic situations involving non-rigid lung and heart motions. And finally, Specific Aim 4 is dedicated to an application and study of the developed DL approaches to specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage. 1 Project Narrative  The major goal of this project is to improve the diagnostic, treatment guidance, and research utility of quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, through the development of robust, near real-time, deep-learning based reconstruction approaches allowing efficacious use of standard, low dose, and novel low activity imaging molecular bio-tracers. The proposed work is relevant to public health, since an improvement in the reconstructed images will lead to more accurate diagnosis of diseases and more accurate treatment guidance and monitoring of the response to therapy, while allowing for decreased patient radiation dose. It will also facilitate quantitatively reliable tools for research investigations with new radiotracers for PET tailored to specific diseases. 2",Deep Learning Reconstruction for Improved TOF PET Using Histo-Image Partitioning,10276952,R01EB031806,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Breast ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Explosion ', ' Goals ', ' Half-Life ', ' instrumentation ', ' Isotopes ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Positron ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' detector ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Application procedure ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Investigation ', ' proton therapy ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' solid state ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Tracer ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' loss of function ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Geometry ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' learning network ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' chimeric antigen receptor T cells ', ' CAR T cells ', ' T cells for CAR ', ' chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,620138
"Models and methods for automatically measuring disease body-wide and staging disease via FDG-PET/CT in Lymphoma Quantitative Radiology holds great promise to transform our ability to diagnose, monitor, stage, prognosticate, and detect diseases as well as to plan and guide patient therapeutic interventions. However, the process of locating and delineating anatomic organs and pathologic regions in medical images, known as image segmentation, at a high level of automation has remained a major hurdle to these advances. Most developments on image segmentation have focused on a specific organ or a small group of objects in a specific body region. A new method or a major adaptation of an existing method is engineered when any of these parameters changed. Such an approach is not sustainable and becomes a stumbling block when dealing with whole-body systemic diseases where body-wide image analytics is required. A critical advance is needed in this field to overcome two main challenges: (1) Although prior information about normal anatomy is deemed vital for image segmentation and analysis, its creation and utilization body-wide on a massive scale have not been attempted and are sorely lacking. (2) Techniques to employ such information and methods for body-wide disease quantification at high levels of automation do not exist. The overarching goal is to overcome these challenges by developing a body-wide and generalizable anatomy-guided deep learning image segmentation methodology and demonstrate its application in the study of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) for which PET-based staging and response assessment are of paramount importance. The project has three specific aims. Aim1: To develop a family of body-wide anatomy models representing the entire human adult age spectrum. Existing FDG PET/CT scans of 600 patients from two institutions (Penn and New York Proton Center) covering 10 age groups will be utilized to build anatomy models involving 50 organs and 50 lymph node zones in the extended body torso including neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. A family of 40 anatomy models representing the 4 body regions and 10 age groups will be created from roughly 60,000 3D object samples. Aim2: To develop, implement, and validate a methodology for localizing objects and to quantify disease without explicitly delineating organs and lesions. Gender- and age-specific anatomy models will be utilized for automatically locating the above 100 objects in any given patient PET/CT image and to quantify disease in each body region, organ, and lymph node zone. The methods will be tested on 400 PET/CT images of DLBCL patients. Aim3: To develop and validate an automated method of DLBCL disease staging and prognosis. The disease quantity information will be utilized to develop automated staging and outcome prediction algorithms which will be tested on the above 400 cases in comparison to current clinical methods. Two key outcomes of this project will be: an unprecedented well-curated database of body-wide images, segmented objects, and family of models; and a validated methodology for automatic body-wide disease quantification and disease staging in DLBCL. Most current methods for the fundamental image analysis task of object segmentation have focused on a small group of objects and were designed to operate on a specific imaging modality - an approach that is not sustainable and becomes a stumbling block when dealing with whole-body systemic diseases where body- wide image analysis is called for. The main goal of this project is to develop a body-wide and generalizable image segmentation and analytics methodology that is based on creating a comprehensive family of body-wide anatomic models covering the entire adult human age spectrum and performing disease quantification without explicitly delineating objects. The project will apply this methodology to the study of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a common subtype of lymphoma, for which PET-based staging and response assessment/ prediction is of paramount importance clinically.",Models and methods for automatically measuring disease body-wide and staging disease via FDG-PET/CT in Lymphoma,10296059,R01CA255748,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Automation ', ' Body Burden ', ' Body Regions ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' lymph nodes ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymphatic nodes ', ' lymph gland ', ' lymphnodes ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Names ', ' Neck ', ' New York ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' DLBCL ', ' Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ', "" large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma "", ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Systemic disease ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' age group ', ' Performance ', ' object recognition ', ' Agreement ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' FDG PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' Normalities ', ' Normalcy ', ' Institution ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' PET/CT scan ', ' PET/CT ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' task analysis ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' deep learning ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,647411
"Protein structure determination from low-resolution experimental data Project Abstract Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology, providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high- resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution structural information. Both cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, when applied to large, flexible molecular machines, often produce data of 3-6 Å resolution. Extracting detailed atomic information from this data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins may adopt. I propose to develop computational methods for extracting high-resolution atomic models from this low-resolution data, bridging the “resolution gap” with computational methods. My proposed research develops and extends our labs’ methods for automatically inferring atomic accuracy models, from these “near-atomic” resolution sources of experimental data. We develop novel conformational sampling methods, guided by experimental data, to infer atomic information both in cases where homologous high-resolution data is available, and where it is not. Additionally, we propose development of methods for estimating model uncertainty; these are critical in understanding to what degree structural conclusions may be made from a particular dataset. Finally, in pushing the resolution limit further, we develop general tools for biomolecular forcefield optimization. These machine-learning tools will allow development of a next-generation forcefield, critical in extending the resolution limit of data from which we can infer atomic details. The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to determine protein structures to atomic accuracy from only sparse experimental data. Combined, the three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic interactions from sparse experimental data. This will lead to determination of structures that will reveal key insights into how biomedically important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease. Project Narrative This project develops computational tools for accurately determining protein structure from low- resolution experimental data.

"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,10221053,R01LM013311,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Heart ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organ Survival ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Plants ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Tissue Transplantation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Space Models ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Techniques ', ' hazard ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' cost ', ' immunogenicity ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' graft failure ', ' learning network ', ' discrete time ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' survival prediction ', ' predict survival ', ' predictor of survival ', ' high dimensionality ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' transplant model ', ' treatment comparison ', ' compare treatment ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2021,277764
"Center for Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) PROJECT SUMMARY  Experimental determination of protein structure often provides atomic accuracy models, but is inherently time- consuming, often costly, and not always possible. Computational modeling is currently less accurate, but offers an alternative approach when experimental results are not available. The goal of CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) is to advance the protein structure modeling field by conducting community-wide experiments that objectively determine the strengths and weaknesses of current methods and so foster progress. Approximately 100 research groups world-wide participate. In the most recent experiment (2018), there were 57,000 submissions in nine modeling categories, including over 35,000 tertiary structure models. The Center provides the infrastructure for CASP and Aim 1 is the continued development and operation of this resource. Principal tasks include registration and communication with participants; solicitation, characterization, and management of modeling targets; collection and validation of models; and extensive numerical analysis of submissions. These operations are supported by a secure and robust data infrastructure. The Center also develops evaluation, analysis, and display software, and provides access to models and evaluation results. CASP relies on independent assessors, experts in modeling or a related experimental field, to interpret the results. The Center coordinates this process, providing evaluation data and, when necessary, implementing new evaluation methods.  Recent CASPs have shown dramatic improvements in model accuracy, especially for the most difficult cases where homology modeling cannot be used. A major factor driving progress is the use of new machine learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks. These and related methods appear poised to make further major advances in a number of key modeling areas. The plan for the next period of the project is designed to capitalize on these and other opportunities for progress. Greater success with modeling small proteins and domains dictates a shift in emphasis to the still challenging area of large multi-domain proteins and complexes (Aim 2), where progress is expected both from the machine learning developments and from the incorporation of sparse experimental data. Although accuracy of models has improved, it is still seldom competitive with experiment. Aim 3 is to pursue strategies that will make models more accurate and useful, by nurturing further progress in refining initial models, better methods for estimating model accuracy, and assessment of the utility of models. Aim 4 introduces new ways of strengthening interactions between CASP and the broader research community, providing models that directly address contemporary problems (for example, for CoV-2 protein structures) and boosting communications through meetings, webinars, publications and other means. PROJECT NARRATIVE Knowledge of macromolecular structure plays a crucial role in biology and medicine, allowing for detailed studies and understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms.

"Hematopoietic Stem Cell And Cord Blood Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hematopoietic cell transplantation from unrelated donors, haploidentical related donors and cord blood units can cure life-threatening blood disorders; however, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse and survivorship disparities across different ancestries remain the major obstacles. When matched donors are not available, the properties of HLA mismatches that govern (non)-permissivity are not well-defined. Furthermore, the role of KIR/HLA interactions in modulating relapse remain to be clarified. These deficiencies have important implications for a large fraction of patients who lack HLA-matched donors, and for all patients at risk for disease relapse. We have demonstrated that HLA class I leader peptides, HLA-DP expression, and HLA/KIR interactions each contribute to GVHD, relapse and mortality. The unmet needs are to understand the mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes modulate transplant risks, and a means to apply the research findings to clinical care. We propose to define the underlying mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes and proteins function in transplantation, and develop tools for using HLA and KIR in the selection of the optimal transplant donor and cord blood unit. The specific aims are to: define the role of HLA-DP expression and peptide-binding groove pocket in GVHD; define NKG2/HLA-E interactions and HLA-G in GVHD and relapse; define the role for KIR and HLA interaction in relapse after HCT for acute leukemia, and design tools to evaluate gene features in clinical practice. The goals will be achieved through systemic analysis of individual gene variation, haplotypes of genes, and receptor/ligand recognition in large ethnically diverse transplant populations with complete clinical data. This proposal will fill the knowledge gap in the immunobiological basis of GVHD, relapse and survivorship disparities in transplantation. The information will increase the safety, efficacy and availability of transplantation for all patients in need of this life-saving therapy.

"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients.

"Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to determine the contribution of hemodynamic factors to risk assessment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) and calculate these factors from enhanced in vivo 4D flow MRI data. Even though most UIAs are stable, the majority of UIA patients are offered interventional treatment due to the grave risk presented if an aneurysm ruptures. Previous studies indicated that in addition to clinical (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities) and morphological (e.g., location and size) factors, UIA progression is affected by local blood flow dynamics. Hemodynamic factors associated with UIA growth can be obtained from computational and experimental models or from 4D flow MRI measurements; however, each approach has limitations. The previous NIH-funded project focused on developing image-based computational methods for predicting postoperative flow following interventions. The goal of this renewal is to use the developed framework to improve risk stratification of UIAs using image-based flow analysis. The proposed project will develop multi-parametric predictive models that combine clinical and morphological factors with hemodynamic factors calculated from augmented 4D flow MRI data. The UIA growth predicted by different models will be compared to outcomes observed in longitudinal imaging studies. The aims of the proposed project are, therefore, to: (1) determine the probability of UIA growth by utilizing morphological and clinical factors together with hemodynamic factors obtained from computational and experimental flow models by a) performing statistical analysis based on morphological and clinical factors obtained from longitudinal imaging, and b) extending statistical model by including hemodynamic factors computed from patient-specific models; (2) Enhance 4D flow MRI data by a) determining 4D flow reproducibility and variability with in vitro studies, and b) applying advanced data augmentation methods to improve the accuracy of calculated hemodynamic factors affecting aneurysm growth; (3) determine the probability of UIA growth based on multi-parametric analysis utilizing hemodynamic factors calculated from enhanced 4D flow MRI. Successful completion of the project will resolve the controversy regarding how hemodynamic factors affect aneurysm growth and establish 4D flow MRI as a diagnostic tool for UIA risk stratification. This collaborative project engages the cardiovascular engineering group at Purdue University and neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and MRI physicists at Northwestern University, University of California San Francisco and Barrow Neurological Institute. This cross-disciplinary team will bring together experts in neurovascular surgeries, MRI velocimetry, patient-specific flow computations, experimental fluid mechanics and statistical analysis. Retrospective and prospective UIAs data obtained from these superb clinical centers will be used in this study. The outstanding engineering resources available at Purdue and world-class imaging resources at Northwestern, UC San Francisco and Barrow, as well as existing the data sharing agreements between these institutions and ongoing collaborations between the PIs, will ensure the project's success. PROJECT NARRATIVE The majority of brain aneurysms are treated, despite the fact that most of them have very low risk or rupture. Studies indicated that brain aneurysm risk factors include a range of clinical (e.g., patient’s age, sex, family history) and anatomical (e.g., aneurysm location, size and shape) parameters, as well as local blood flow dynamics. The proposed studies will determine the specific contribution of blood flow variables for improving the risk assessment of brain aneurysms and examine whether these variables can be reliably calculated from flow velocities measured with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging.",Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI,10231251,R01HL115267,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Aneurysm ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Intracranial Aneurysm ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' brain blood flow ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Engineering ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Thrombus ', ' Velocimetries ', ' Guidelines ', ' Ruptured Aneurysm ', ' enhancing factor ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Ensure ', ' Blood flow ', ' residence ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' particle ', ' success ', ' Agreement ', ' Brain Aneurysms ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cerebral Aneurysm ', ' shear stress ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Multiparametric Analysis ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Rupture ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' data sharing ', ' clinical risk ', ' 4D MRI ', ' 4-D MR imaging ', ' 4-D MRI ', ' 4-D flow MR imaging ', ' 4-D flow MRI ', ' 4-D flow imaging ', ' 4-D flow magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4-D magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4D MR imaging ', ' 4D flow MR imaging ', ' 4D flow MRI ', ' 4D flow imaging ', ' 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4D magnetic resonance imaging ', ' four dimensional MR imaging ', ' four dimensional MRI ', ' four dimensional flow ', ' four dimensional magnetic resonance imaging ', ' neurovascular ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' imaging study ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,644477
"Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation Summary/Abstract Alignment of biological sequences is a key step in understanding their evolution, function, and patterns of activity. Here, we describe Machine Learning approaches to improve both accuracy and speed of highly- sensitive sequence alignment. To improve accuracy, we develop methods to reduce erroneous annotation caused by (1) the existence of low complexity and repetitive sequence and (2) the overextension of alignments of true homologs into unrelated sequence. We describe approaches based on both hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks to dramatically reduce these sorts of sequence annotation error. We also address the issue of annotation speed, with development of a custom Deep Learning architecture designed to very quickly filter away large portions of candidate sequence comparisons prior to the relatively-slow sequence-alignment step. The results of these efforts will be incorporated into forks of the open source sequence alignment tools HMMER, MMSeqs, and (where appropriate) BLAST; we will also work with community developers of annotation pipelines, such as RepeatMasker and IMG/M, to incorporate these approaches. The development and incorporation into these widely used bioinformatics tools will lead to widespread impact on sequence annotation efforts. Narrative Modern molecular biology depends on effective methods for creating sequence alignments quickly and accurately. This proposal describes a plan to develop novel Machine Learning approaches that will dramatically increase the speed of highly-sensitive sequence alignment, and will also address two significant sources of erroneous sequence annotation, (i) the presence of repetitive sequence in biological sequences, and (ii) the tendency for sequence alignment algorithms to extend alignments beyond the boundaries of true homology. The proposed methods represent a mix of applications of hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks, and build on prior success in applying such methods to the problem of sensitive sequence annotation.",Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation,10231149,R01GM132600,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' DNA Transposable Elements ', ' Transposable Elements ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Proteins ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Work ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Repetitive Sequence ', ' Repetitive Element ', ' Repetitive Regions ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Licensing ', ' Error Sources ', ' Descriptor ', ' Letters ', ' Fugu ', ' Takifugu ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Deletion Mutation ', ' Insertion Mutation ', ' Collection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' markov model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Consumption ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' Industry Standard ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' annotation  system ', ' annotation framework ', ' annotation tool ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA,R01,2021,287379
"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations. Project Narrative The public health relevance of this proposal is that it will provide an infrastructure for analyzing impacts of dietary components and microbiomes throughout the body. The analysis of these maps will help us identify dietary components that improve resistance to infectious disease.",Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity,10226176,DP1AT010885,"['Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Maps ', ' Minerals ', ' Miniaturization ', ' Miniaturisations ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vitamins ', ' Work ', ' Enhancers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Robot ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Nutritional status ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Phytochemical ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' immunological status ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Sampling ', ' resistance to disease ', ' resistant disease ', ' resistant to disease ', ' Disease Resistance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Antimicrobial resistant ', ' Resistance to antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistant ', ' resistance to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to anti-microbial ', ' resistant to antimicrobial ', ' Antimicrobial Resistance ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Component ', ' Metabolite Interaction ', ' Supplementation ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' nanolitre scale ', ' nano liter scale ', ' nano litre scale ', ' nanoliter scale ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Microbe ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' side effect ', ' dietary ', ' ']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP1,2021,1106000
"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications.

"Sample-specific Models for Molecular Portraits of Diseases in Precision Medicine A fundamental challenge in precision medicine is to understand the patterns of differentiation between individuals. To address this challenge, we propose to go beyond the traditional `one disease--one model' view of bioinformatics and pursue a new view built upon personalized patient models that facilitates precision medicine by leveraging both commonalities within a patient cohort as well as signatures unique to every individual patient. With the emergence of large-scale databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which collect multi-omic data on many different diseases, a new “pan-omics” and “pan-disease” paradigm has emerged to jointly analyze all patients in a disease cohort while accounting for patient-specific effects. An example of this is the recently released Pan-Cancer Atlas. At the same time, next generation statistical tools to accurately and rigorously draw the necessary inferences are lacking. In this project we propose a series of mathematically rigorous, statistically sound, and computationally feasible approaches to infer sample-specific models, providing a more complete view of heterogeneous datasets. By bringing together ideas from the machine learning, statistics, and mathematical optimization communities, we provide a rigorous framework for precision medicine via sample-specific statistical models. Crucially, we propose to analyze this framework and prove strong theoretical guarantees under weak assumptions--this dramatically distinguishes our framework from much of the existing literature. Towards these goals, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Discovery of new molecular profiles with sample-specific statistical models. We propose a general framework for inferring sample-specific models with low-rank structure based on the novel concept of distance-matching. This allows us to infer statistical models at the level of a single patient without overfitting, and is general enough to be applied for prediction, classification, and network inference as well as a variety of diseases and phenotypes. Aim 2: Multimodal approaches to personalized diagnosis--contextually interpretable models for actionable clinical decision support. In order to translate these models into practice, we propose a novel interpretable predictive model that supports complex, multimodal data types such as images and text combined with high-level interpretable features such as SNP data, gender, age, etc. This framework simultaneously boosts the accuracy of clinical predictions by exploiting sample heterogeneity while providing human-digestable explanations for the predictions being made. Aim 3: Next-generation precision medicine--algorithms and software for personalized estimation. To put our models into practical use, we will develop new algorithms for interpretable prediction of personalized clinical outcomes and visualization of personalized statistical models. All of our tools will be combined into a user-friendly software package called PrecisionX that will be freely available to researchers and clinicians everywhere. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Personalization with data is a critical challenge whenever decisions must be made at scale, and has applications that go beyond precision medicine; businesses, educational institutions, and financial institutions are among the many players that have acknowledged a stake in this complex problem. We expect the proposed work to provide a rigorous foundation for personalization with large and high-dimensional datasets, finding use throughout the broader scientific community as well as with industry and educational institutions. Alongside our collaboration with Pitt/UPMC, we will work with physicians and data scientists for practical feedback as well as provide training in the methods developed.

"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human iPSC-based models of Marfan Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY Marfan Syndrome (MFS), one of the most common heritable connective tissue disorders, affects 1 in 5,000 individuals and has destructive manifestations in multiple organ systems; notably the cardiovascular system. MFS is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a genetic mutation in the Fibrillin-1 gene leading to aberrant TGFβ signaling, and frequently results in aortic aneurysm, dissection, and death. Interestingly, the associated degeneration within the aortic vessel wall almost always occurs in the aortic root or ascending aorta and not in the descending or abdominal aorta; while this putatively reflects regional differences in hemodynamic stress, antihypertensive treatment alone is not effective in managing aortic aneurysm in MFS. Alternatively, it is also the case that aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), which predominate the vasoactive medial layer of the vessel wall, have heterogeneous subtypes stemming from distinct developmental germ-layers based on their anatomical location; Neuroectoderm (NE) origin gives rise to ascending ASMCs and Paraxial mesoderm (PM) origin gives rise to descending ASMCs. This project will use origin-specific ASMCs differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MFS and healthy controls to test a novel hypothesis that developmental origin causes location-specific abnormalities in ASMCs associated with medial degeneration in MFS. Additionally, it will explore for biomarkers of presymptomatic congenital defects in Marfan Syndrome to identify novel targets for prophylactic therapeutic intervention. These studies will characterize phenotypic differences in human ASMC subtypes at the cellular and tissue level with stem-cell culturing and vascular tissue engineering techniques. Using state-of-the-art core facilities we will also conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on these cellular and tissue models to cultivate a rich biological profile for bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, we will develop a bioinformatics pipeline to elucidate novel prophylactic targets inherently responsible for ascending aortic MFS-induced medial degeneration, using our uniquely combined phenotypic, transcriptomic, and proteomic results as input. Lastly, based on our bioinformatic outputs we will test our intervention on our human iPSC-based in vitro models and compare to treatment with Losartan, a commonly used anti-hypertensive drug that also exhibits unique anti-remodeling properties and has shown promise for managing the symptoms of MFS in animals and in patients. The training plan for this fellowship will focus on technical skills, experimental design and critical analysis, critique of published scientific data, and presentation skills. It will be achieved by regular mentor meetings, journal clubs, conference presentations, bi- annual committee meetings, and advanced coursework. The majority of training will occur in the Costa Lab at the Cardiovascular Research Center at ISMMS, a highly active and collaborative environment with available mentors and students aligned with my research topics and career goals. Additional training will occur in the Ramirez Lab with senior researchers in Marfan Syndrome and biochemical investigation techniques. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposes a bioengineering approach for investigating new human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based cellular and 3D tissue models of Marfan Syndrome (MFS), a rare connective tissue disorder that frequently causes aortic aneurysm and dissection specifically in the ascending aorta. Our findings will elucidate mechanobiological differences in aortic smooth muscle cells of distinct embryologic origin, and their underlying mechanisms of response to mechanical stimuli. This will help improve our understanding of aneurysm localization in MFS, and guide more effective therapies for MFS patients in the future.",Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human

"Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations PROJECT SUMMARY  Large confirmatory or pragmatic clinical trials enroll patients from multiple centers to obtain high-quality evidence useful for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. The design of multicenter trials is particularly appealing to policymakers because many tend to be pragmatic and offer access to a large sample of diverse patient populations. Decision-makers trying to use the results of multicenter trials have specific target populations in mind. Yet, selection at both the center and individual participant level challenges the ability of even well-designed and conducted multicenter trials to draw inferences about any meaningful target population. These selection mechanisms, even in impeccably conducted multicenter trials, result in samples of trial participants that are not representative of any specific target population. When treatment effects are heterogeneous over covariates that are differentially distributed across centers, the overall trial average treatment effect estimate will not apply to any one of the populations underlying the participating centers or the target population. Consider for example, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large multicenter trial of 33 centers (53,456 individuals) across the United States, which motivated this proposal. Because the positive benefits of screening are mainly concentrated in individuals at high-risk for lung cancer it is critical that individuals are appropriately targeted for screening recommendations. Our long-term objective is to optimize the applicability of trial results into clinical practice. We will take steps toward this objective by achieving the following specific aims: (1) Develop robust and efficient statistical methods, that can be combined with modern machine learning techniques, to reinterpret a multicenter trial in the context of each of the participating centers and to transport inferences from a multicenter trial to a new target population; (2) Evaluate the performance of methods developed in Aim 1 in simulation studies that reflect real-world data by considering scenarios with different sample sizes, number of centers, treatment effects, and outcome or selection mechanisms; (3) Apply the methods in the NLST to reinterpret the trial in the context of one of the participating centers and to transport trial findings to a new target population using baseline data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the United States general population. The proposed work is innovative for analyzing multicenter trials because it develops new methods, clarifies the assumptions needed for obtaining valid inference, and empirically assesses method performance. This work is significant because as a result of applying these methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials. Insights gained from this work will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. Selection bias at both the individual and center level challenge the applicability of trial findings to populations often underrepresented in trials, such as women, ethnic/racial minorities, or the elderly. This work aligns with AHRQ’s mission and priority areas because as a result of applying these proposed methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying target populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials, where decisions must be made.",Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations,10228266,R36HS028373,[''],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R36,2021,43083
"BOND: Benchmarking based on heterogeneous biOmedical Network and Deep learning novel drug-target associations Project Summary/Abstract The applicant’s goals are to develop the necessary skills to become an independent translational biomedical informatics researcher in the area of computational drug repurposing. Exploring novel drug-target interactions (DTI) plays a crucial role in drug development. In order to lower the overall costs and uncover more potential screening targets, computational (in silico) methods have become popular and are commonly applied to poly-pharmacology and drug repurposing. Although machine learning-based strategies have been studied for years, there is no standardized benchmark that provides large-scale training datasets as well as diverse evaluation tasks to test different methods. Furthermore, the existing methods suffer from remarkable limitations, where 1) results are often biased due to a lack of negative samples, 2) novel drug-target associations with new (or isolated) drugs/targets cannot be explored, and 3) the comprehensive topological structure cannot be captured by feature learning methods . Therefore, in the era of big data, the applicant proposes a study to tackle the challenges by achieving two aims. • Aim 1 (K99 Phase): Develop a large scale benchmark for evaluating drug-target prediction based on the  generation of a multipartite network from heterogeneous biomedical datasets. • Aim 2 (R00 Phase): Adapt a deep learning model to build an accurate predictive model based on a novel  feature learning algorithm that mines the multi-dimensional biomedical network (multipartite network). In the mentored phase, the applicant will integrate heterogeneous biomedical datasets and build a benchmark for evaluation of the drug-target prediction based on well-designed strategies. The applicant will receive training in standardization tools for data integration, tools, and skills for data management, evaluation methods for drug-target predictions, and state-of-the-art machine learning/deep learning methods in computer-aided pharmacology. Complementary didactic, intellectual, and professional training will help prepare the applicant for the R00 phase where he will develop a deep learning-based predictive model and multi-dimensional graph embedding methods for feature learning. Together, these novel studies will advance the current computational drug repurposing by providing 1) comprehensive benchmarking for testing and evaluation, and 2) a scalable and accurate predictive model based on a biomedical multi-partite network. The applicant will be mentored by senior, established investigators with substantial expertise in Semantic Web, computational biology, cancer genomics, drug development, and machine learning/deep learning. Importantly, this project will provide a foundation for the applicant to establish independent research programs in 1) computational drug repurposing in real cases, 2) investigation of the diverse hidden associations in system biology (e.g., associations between drugs, genetics, and diseases), and 3) precision medicine aimed applications leveraging biomedical knowledgebases and electronic health records. Project Narrative The field of computational drug repurposing lacks a large scale benchmark that provides comprehensive and standard evaluation tasks as well as a scalable and accurate prediction model that can handle large biomedical datasets. This study aims to utilize Semantic Web technology to construct a multi-partite network based on heterogeneous biomedical databases and develop a deep learning-based predictive model based on the network.

"Virtual Biopsy with Tissue-level Accuracy in Glioma Project Summary This is a Bioengineering Research Grant (BRG) proposal in response to PAR-19-158 to further develop and validate a non-invasive panel of the most critical glioma molecular markers (IDH, 1p/19q, MGMT) using standard clinical MRI T2-weighted images and deep learning, and extend the performance to tissue-level accuracies. Currently, the only reliable way of obtaining molecular marker status is through direct tissue sampling of the tumor, requiring either a craniotomy and stereotactic biopsy or a large open surgical resection. Noninvasive determination of molecular markers with tissue-level accuracy would be transformational in the management of gliomas, reducing or eliminating the risks and costs associated with a neurosurgical procedure, accelerating the time to definitive treatment, improving patient experience and ultimately patient outcomes and survival time. Artificial intelligence such as deep learning has emerged as a powerful method for classification of imaging data that can exceed human performance. Preliminary work using our novel voxel-wise classification-segmentation approach with the NIH/NCI TCIA glioma database has outperformed any prior noninvasive methods for determination of IDH, 1p/19q, and MGMT methylation, achieving accuracies of 97%, 93%, and 95%, respectively. The approach however, needs to be validated beyond the TCIA and accuracies need to be extended in order to achieve tissue level performance. This will be accomplished by using our top-performing voxel-wise classification framework, leveraging marker-specific targeted sample sizes, and gaining a final boost from deep-learning artifact correction networks. In Aim 1 we will curate a database of over 2000 gliomas including 500 subjects from our institution, 1200 subjects from our external collaborators, and over 300 subjects from the TCIA. We will train our voxel-wise deep learning classifiers to determine molecular status based on clinical T2-weighted MR images with target accuracies of 97%. In Aim 2 we will rigorously evaluate the motion and noise sensitivity of the networks and create an artifact correction network with the goals of 1) recovering accuracies in the setting of large amounts of motion/noise and 2) further boosting accuracy to tissue-level performance even in the absence of visible artifact. In Aim 3 we will deploy a complete end-to-end clinical workflow and evaluate real-world live performance of the AI tool on 300 prospectively acquired brain tumor cases and 300 subjects from our external collaborators. The AI tool will be made available for deployment at other medical centers. The developed framework can also be extended to additional markers in a straightforward fashion. In summary, this BRG proposal will further develop, refine and validate a non-invasive MRI-based method for determining the most critical glioma molecular markers rivaling tissue-level accuracies to significantly reduce and in many cases eliminate the need for stereotactic biopsy. Project Narrative Knowledge of molecular status for a variety of markers in gliomas has moved to the forefront in clinical decision- making. This requires direct tissue sampling either from an invasive brain biopsy or open surgical resection. In this Bioengineering Research Grant proposal in response to PAR-19-158, we will develop and validate a non- invasive method to determine a panel of the most critical molecular markers (IDH, 1p/19q and MGMT methylation) with near tissue-level accuracies using routine T2-weighted (T2w) MR images and deep learning algorithms to significantly reduce and in many cases eliminate the need for stereotactic biopsy in glioma.",Virtual Biopsy with Tissue-level Accuracy in Glioma,10226632,R01CA260705,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automation ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biopsy ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Craniotomy ', ' skull incision ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glioma ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Hyperacusis ', ' Hyperacusia ', ' Loudness Perception Disturbances ', ' Loudness Recruitment ', ' decreased loudness tolerance ', ' loudness intolerance ', ' noise sensitivity ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Sample Size ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Neurological Surgery ', ' Neurosurgical Procedures ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' response ', ' Institution ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' DNA-6-O-Methylguanine[protein]-L-Cysteine S-Methyltransferase ', ' EC 2.1.1.63 ', ' Guanine-O(6)-Alkyltransferase ', ' MGMT ', ' Methylated-DNA Protein-Cysteine Methyltransferase ', ' Methylated-DNA-Protein-Cysteine S-Methyltransferase ', ' Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase Gene ', ' O(6)-AGT ', ' O(6)-Alkylguanine-DNA Alkyltransferase ', ' O(6)-MeG-DNA Methyltransferase ', ' O(6)-Methylguanine DNA Transmethylase ', ' O(6)-Methylguanine Methyltransferase ', ' O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase ', ' O6-Alkylguanine DNA Alkyltransferase ', ' alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase ', ' methylguanine DNA methyltransferase ', ' MGMT gene ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' 19q ', ' Chromosome 19 Distal Arm ', ' Chromosome 19 Long Arm ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' prospective ', ' tumor ', ' motion sensitivity ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' contrast imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' mutational status ', ' mutation status ', ' virtual biopsy ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' clinical translation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ', ' DICOM ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' learning classifier ', ' The Cancer Imaging Archive ', ' TCIA ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,655597
"Outcomes for CLL patients treated with novel therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We have recently conducted and published a game changing phase 3 clinical North American Intergroup (NAIG) trial (E1912) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) therapy which tested a combination of Ibrutinib and Rituximab (IR) vs. the prior gold standard chemoimmunotherapy (CIT): fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). This trial showed that both progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are superior with IR and subsequently was the driving factor in FDA approval for frontline use of IR in progressive previously untreated CLL in the spring of 2020. While our work revealed distinct clinical advantages to non-CIT approaches, a number of new questions have emerged with respect to how best apply this advance. The durability of the response to first-line ibrutinib-based therapy is highly variable and requires indefinite treatment exposing patients to the risk of chronic toxicity and selective pressure that may foster resistant clones. The ability to more accurately predict the durability of response could help identify patients more likely to have long term remission with ibrutinib therapy (candidates for time limited therapy) and those more likely to have a short duration of response whom may benefit from intensive combination therapy with alternative novel agents. We wish to develop a unique model(s) incorporating multiple key prognostic factors that will have a high level of confidence in predicting patient outcomes to novel therapy combination. Our initial study on patients treated on IR arm of E1912 found a subset of patients on the IR arm with evidence for emerging mutations and changes in their clonal architecture predicting relapse. The exact mechanisms for relapse need to be defined as we predict that these patients will be difficult to treat and alternative strategies needed. We found that IR therapy was uniquely able to reactivate the previously exhausted T cell killing activity directed against the leukemic CLL cells. While we have some information on the mechanism(s) for this, much remains to be learned and also the exact timing for achieving the maximal restoration of T cell function or fitness. This beneficial impact on T cell function will also be studied as it relates to generation of CAR T cells as these cells are powerful inducers of immunotherapy which is itself capable of removing residual CLL tumor burden. We hypothesize that the outcome of the studies will add significant and important information on how to best select non-chemotherapy for CLL patients and also the treatment impact on the immune system. These goals will be accomplished through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop an Integrated Model to Predict Clinical Outcomes for CLL Patients Treated with Novel Agents. Aim 2: Determine the Genetic, Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Changes in Ibrutinib Treated CLL. Aim 3: Characterize the Impact of Ibrutinib Treatment on T-cell Fitness to Guide Application of Immunotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE These scientific studies assess important ways that Ibrutinib-based therapy for upfront therapy of CLL patients can be evaluated adding important decision parameters on who would benefit the most from this approach, strategies on how to best treat refractory or relapsed patients and on the most opportune times to utilize blood T cells for immunotherapy. In total this collective analysis will provide critical insights on this therapeutic approach and in this fashion improve the health of individuals with this disease.",Outcomes for CLL patients

"THE CANCER EPITOPE DATABASE AND ANALYSIS RESOURCE ABSTRACT Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in interest towards cancer epitopes in general, and neoepitopes that encompass mutations arising in a given tumor in particular. Current lines of research examine how the epitope load in a given tumor relates to the success of checkpoint blockade treatments, and how to utilize epitope-based vaccines and adoptive transfer of epitope-specific T cells for personalized therapies. For these purposes, neoepitopes that are recurrently recognized in different individuals are of particular interest, which has also re-ignited interest in epitopes identified in classic tumor-associated antigens. Along with the interest in cancer epitopes, there is also interest in the TCRs and BCRs specifically recognizing them, as these have the potential to be used in therapeutic approaches, and they can aid in basic studies to infer the specificity of T cells or B cells characterized in single cell sequencing data. This resurgence of interest in epitopes has created a need to catalog and make accessible to the scientific community all epitope data, also linked to the biological, immunological, and clinical contexts. The ultimate goal is to come “full circle” and link epitope recognition and immunological readouts to clinical outcomes and treatment strategies alike. In parallel, there is an urgent need to develop resources for epitope prediction and analysis tools that provide access to predictive strategies and provide objective evaluations of their performance in the relevant biological, immunological, and clinical contexts. Recent years have also witnessed the publication of multiple original methodologies that reported sometimes impressive gains in the predictions of cancer epitopes. However, several of these studies were difficult to evaluate, because the methodologies and/or datasets were not fully available in a format that was readily executable. As a result, their performance could not be properly benchmarked on independent datasets. This is also because effective benchmarking on independent datasets requires the assembly of novel datasets of sufficient size and diversity. To overcome all of these information technology challenges, we propose to design and implement the Cancer Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (CEDAR), which will provide a freely accessible, comprehensive collection of cancer epitope and receptor data curated from the literature, and provide easily accessible epitope and TCR/BCR target prediction and analysis tools. As the cancer epitope data are curated, they will be used as a transparent benchmark of how well prediction tools perform, and also to develop new prediction tools for the analysis resource component of CEDAR. CEDAR will leverage our expertise from developing the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), which is fully operational and widely used by researchers globally. CEDAR will directly complement other projects currently funded through the NIH ITCR program that provide resources and tools related to cancer omics data. Finally, we will engage in outreach activities to improve functions, user interfaces, and interoperability with other ITCR tools and promote the use of CEDAR in cancer research. NARRATIVE Progress in the use of epitopes for cancer immunology and immunotherapy is hampered by a disconnect in information technology, which segregates investigators from the data and tools needed to appropriately conduct their research. Development of a Cancer Epitope Database and Analysis Resource will overcome this issue by harmonizing and centralizing the capture of cancer epitope data, and by using these data to establish and evaluate epitope analysis and prediction tools that will be made freely available to the research community.",THE CANCER EPITOPE DATABASE AND ANALYSIS RESOURCE,10187436,U24CA248138,"['thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Technology ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' cancer antigens ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Immunology ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' cancer immunotherapy ', ' anti-cancer immunotherapy ', ' anticancer immunotherapy ', ' immune-based cancer therapies ', ' immunotherapy for cancer ', ' immunotherapy of cancer ', ' T-Lymphocyte Epitopes ', ' T-Cell Epitopes ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adoptive Transfer ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' success ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Informatics ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' outreach program ', ' Property ', ' cancer immunology ', ' neoplasm immunology ', ' tumor immunology ', ' T Cell Specificity ', ' T-Cell Immunologic Specificity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' Receptor Cell ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Histology ', ' Collection ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' disease phenotype ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Information Technology ', ' immunogenicity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' prospective ', ' interoperability ', ' web-accessible ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' treatment strategy ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' translational cancer research ', ' immune checkpoint blockade ', ' check point blockade ', ' checkpoint blockade ', ' immune check point blockade ', ' neoantigens ', ' neo-antigen ', ' neo-epitopes ', ' neoepitopes ', ' Infrastructure ', ' data tools ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Attention ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Study models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' B-Cell Antigen Receptor ', ' B cell receptor ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' ']",NCI,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U24,2021,839852
"Multi-Study Integer Programming Methods for Human Voltammery Project Summary/Abstract  The development of treatments for addiction requires the characterization of neural mechanisms underlying reward. Studying reward in humans requires assays that can detect changes in neurotransmitter levels with high chemical specificity. Recently, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) has been implemented in humans to measure dopamine with high temporal and spatial resolution. This technological achievement was enabled in large part through the novel application of machine learning methods. FSCV relies on statistical tools since FSCV records an electrochemical response which must be converted into concentration estimates via a statistical model. The validity of the scientific conclusions from human FSCV studies therefore depends heavily on the reliability of these statistical models to generate accurate dopamine concentration estimates.  In human FSCV, models are fit on in vitro training sets as making in vivo training sets in humans is infeasible. Producing accurate estimates thus requires that models trained on in vitro training sets generalize to in vivo brain recordings. Combining data from multiple training sets is the standard approach human FSCV researchers have employed to improve model generalizability. This proposal extends work that shows that multi-study machine learning methods improve dopamine concentration estimates by combining training sets from different electrodes such that the resulting average signal (“cyclic voltammogram” or CV) is similar to the average CV of the electrode used in the brain. However, this approach relies on random resampling. This is problematic because the randomness limits the extent to which estimate accuracy can be improved and the slow speed of the resampling approach precludes the generation of estimates during data collection, which is critical to experiment success.  This proposal details the development of methods that leverage mixed integer programming to optimally generate training sets that combine data from multiple electrodes. By generating training sets that are specifically tailored to the electrode used for brain measurements, one can vastly improve dopamine concentration estimate accuracy. The speed of the integer programming methods will enable the use of this approach during data collection. This work will include validation of the methods on in vitro data as well as on data from published in vivo and slice experiments in rodents. By applying methods to published optogenetic experiments, one can compare estimates from the proposed methods and from standard methods. The asymptotic properties of the proposed methods will be characterized analytically assuming a linear mixed effects model and empirically through application of the methods to data simulated under this model.  This work will be conducted at the highly collaborative and innovative Harvard School of Public Health. The fellowship will support growth in statistical, computing and collaborative skills, and prepare the trainee for a productive career as a biostatistics professor who develops methods for neuroscience and addiction research. Project Narrative  Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in humans offers an invaluable tool to study the neural mechanisms underlying reward by allowing for sub-second detection of dopamine during cognitive-behavioral tasks. However, conducting voltammetry in humans presents distinct statistical challenges that must be overcome to ensure optimal dopamine concentration estimates. We propose novel statistical methods that use mixed integer optimization and extend preliminary work that shows multi-study machine learning methods substantially improve dopamine concentration estimate accuracy.",Multi-Study Integer Programming Methods for Human Voltammery,10212321,F31DA052153,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electrodes ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Statistical Computing ', ' statistical process ', ' statistical reasoning ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Scheme ', ' Slice ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' multiple data sources ', ' algorithm training ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2021,37751
"Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine ABSTRACT Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain- restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT), involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength” scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1) dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow- up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation. NARRATIVE Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual reformulations. If successful, follow-up studies will include additional analysis in alternative animal models, a more comprehensive analysis of T cell immune responses, and preparation for advancement into

"Deep Learning Image Analysis Algorithms to Improve Oral Cancer Risk Assessment for Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders Abstract Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) are a group of mucosal diseases in the oral cavity with a risk of progressing to oral squamous cell carcinoma. Risk assessment is traditionally done through a combination of clinical and histologic evaluation. Leukoplakia is a common type of OPMD that is given a histologic grading score that is supposed to be related to its risk of progression. However, there is tremendous intra- and inter- observer heterogeneity in dysplasia grading, leading to variability and uncertainty in risk assessment and treatment planning. This also hinders the ability to study the biology of these lesions. We propose to use whole slide imaging on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections in combination with deep learning methods to build a consistent risk scoring system for OPMD. Our methods will identify cell, nucleus, and tissue architectural features relevant to risk of progression in OPMD. These features will be tested in a large retrospective case-control study and then validated prospectively. We will also explore combining them with genomic and immune biomarkers in order to improve the prognostic power and explore the biolo gy of progression in OPMD. We hope that these efforts will improve and standardize risk assessment for OPMD. This could lead to improved treatment and prevention options by enabling risk stratification and allowing future clinical trials be conducted in a more uniform patient cohort. Similarly, it could improve our understanding for the biology of OPMD and the process of progression to cancer.

"Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in HNSCC ABSTRACT Head and neck cancer is one of the most prevalent aggressive cancers worldwide, with the majority being squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), or HNSCC. The well-known risk factors associated with the genesis of HNSCC include human papillomavirus and environment factors including tobacco and alcohol use. Despite more than two decades of research into the molecular genetics of HNSCC, there is still lack of prognostic biomarkers that can guide current treatment and management of HNSCC patients. Previous studies and our preliminary analysis showed that top immune-centric biomarkers had the most promising prognostic value for HNSCC patients compared to other immunotherapy-favorable cancers such as skin and lung cancers. In this R01 project, we propose a large-scale secondary analysis of existing transcriptomic and genetic data to elucidate the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in head and neck cancer. The underlying central hypothesis is that tumor-intrinsic and host-intrinsic immune signaling co-modulate the effectiveness of existing therapies in HNSCC; and elucidation of the interaction between targeted genomic/genetic alternations and background tumor-immune signatures via efficient statistical and machine learning methods can lead to novel prognostic biomarkers, as well as potential therapeutic targets. To this end, we propose three specifics aims. In the first aim, we will generate HNSCC-specific immune signatures by integrating single-cell and bulk-tumor transcriptomic data using novel machine learning methods developed by our team. In the second aim, we will discover and prioritize immune-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) biomarkers by recalling existing transcriptome data and applying an efficient genome-wide screening method. In the third aim, we will combine baseline germline variants with tumor immune signatures and further examine its prognostic value in patients treated by immune checkpoint blockade (provide by multiple institutes including Moffitt, OSU and UNC). Collectively, we propose the most extensive study to date in HNSCC investigating under-investigated element of the genomics source for predicting clinical and tumor immune phenotypes. The new omics data resource and resulted biomarkers, especially the immune-related biomarkers, from our research have potential to impact upon the diagnosis and prognosis of HNSCC patients and could guide more efficient and personalized immunotherapy selection in the future. NARRATIVE There is a pressing and unmet need to identify prognostic biomarkers in head and neck cancer. By repurposing existing genomic data available in public databases and at Moffitt, we propose the first large-scale study investigating the potential of immune mechanistic signatures and their mediators as biomarkers in predicting patient survival outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Such knowledge may lead to improved identification of patient subgroups for development of novel and targeted therapies in HNSCC.",Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion

"Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, LDs take on a higher risk of future ESKD themselves. African American (AA) LDs have an even greater, 3.3-fold, risk of ESKD than white LDs post-donation. Because evidence suggests that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants contribute to this greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly using APOL1 testing to evaluate LD candidates of African ancestry. However, nephrologists do not consistently perform genetic counseling with LD candidates about APOL1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in counseling about APOL1. Without proper counseling, APOL1 testing will magnify LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, jeopardizing their informed consent. Given their elevated risk of ESRD post-donation, and AAs’ widely-held cultural concerns about genetic testing, it is ethically critical to protect AA LD candidates’ safety through APOL1 testing in a culturally competent manner to improve informed decisions about donating.  No transplant programs have integrated APOL1 testing into LD evaluation in a culturally competent manner. Clinical “chatbots,” mobile apps that use artificial intelligence to provide genetic information to patients and relieve constraints on clinicians’ time, can improve informed treatment decisions and reduce decisional conflict. The chatbot “Gia,” created by a medical genetics company, can be adapted to any condition. However, no chatbot on APOL1 is currently available. No counseling training programs are available for nephrologists to counsel AA LDs about APOL1 and donation in a culturally competent manner. Given the shortage of genetic counselors, increasing nephrologists’ genetic literacy is critical to integrating genetic testing into practice.  The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of an APOL1 testing program for AA LDs at two transplant centers serving large AA LD populations (Chicago, IL, and Washington, DC). The APOL1 testing program will evaluate the effect of the culturally competent testing, chatbot, and counseling on AA LD candidates’ decisional conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making, willingness to donate, and satisfaction with informed consent. The specific aims are to: 1. Adapt Gia and transplant counseling to APOL1 for use in routine clinical practice 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on decisional conflict, preparedness, and willingness to  donate in a pre-post design 3. Evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice by using the RE-AIM framework to  longitudinally evaluate nephrologist counseling practices and LDs’ satisfaction with informed consent.  The impact of this study will be the creation of a model for APOL1 testing of AA LDs, which can then be implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. APOL1 will serve as a model for integrating culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other practices to improve patient informed consent. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants may contribute to African American living kidney donors’ even greater (3.3-fold) risk of end-stage renal disease post-donation than white living kidney donors. However, transplant physicians do not consistently use APOL1 genetic testing or counsel African American living donor candidates about APOL1, which may undermine candidates’ ability to give informed consent about donating and exacerbate health disparities in living donation and transplantation. By evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program, the proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly scale up APOL1 testing nationally as a novel and ethical approach to protect African American living donors’ safety and enhance their informed consent.",Integrating a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing program into living donor evaluation,10180256,R01DK128207,"['Adoption ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Altruism ', ' altruistic ', ' Apolipoproteins ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Counseling ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' literacy ', ' Medicine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' African ', ' satisfaction ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Genetic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' culturally competent ', ' cultural competence ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile device application ', ' genetic information ', ' genetic counselor ', ' transplant centers ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' living kidney donor ', ' live kidney donor ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' assess effectiveness ', ' determine effectiveness ', ' effectiveness assessment ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance ', ' RE-AIM ', ' reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance ', ' implementation intervention ', ' implementation outcomes ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,714612
"Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS Network models are used to investigate the spread of HIV/AIDS, but rather than assuming that the members of a population of interest are fully mixed, the network approach enables individual-level specification of contact patterns by considering the structure of connections among the members of the population. By representing individuals as nodes and contacts between pairs of individuals as edges, this network depiction enables identification of individuals who drive the epidemic, allows for accurate assessment of study power in cluster- randomized trials, and makes it possible to evaluate the impact of interventions on the individuals themselves, their partners, and the broader network. There are currently two major mathematical paradigms to the modeling of networks: the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach. In the statistical approach, one specifies a model that states the likelihood of observing a given network, whereas in the mechanistic approach one specifies a set of domain-specific mechanistic rules at the level of individual nodes, the actors in the network, that are used to evolve the network over time. Given that mechanistic models directly model individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – they are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Another attractive feature of mechanistic models is their scalability as they can be implemented for networks consisting of thousands or even millions of nodes, making it possible to simulate population-wide implementation of interventions. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has however impeded their use in real-world settings, a limitation that stems from the fact that there are typically no closed-form likelihood functions available for these models due the exponential increase in the number of ways, as a function of network size, of arriving at a given observed network. We propose to overcome this gap by advancing inferential and model selection methods for mechanistic network models, and by developing a framework for investigating their similarities with statistical network models. We base our approach on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a family of methods developed specifically for settings where likelihood functions are intractable or unavailable. Our specific aims are the following. Aim 1: To develop a statistically principled framework for estimating parameter values and their uncertainty for mechanistic network models. Aim 2: To develop a statistically principled method for model choice between two competing mechanistic network models and estimating the uncertainty surrounding this choice. Aim 3: To establish a framework for mapping mechanistic network models to statistical models. We also propose to implement these methods in open source software, using a combination of Python and C/C++, to facilitate their dissemination and adoption. We believe that the research proposed here can help harness mechanistic network models – and with that leverage some of the insights developed in the network science community over the past decade and more – to help eradicate this disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network models are used to gain a more precise understanding of human behavioral factors associated with the spread of HIV/AIDS in order to develop more effective interventions to halt the epidemic. There are two main mathematical paradigms for modeling networks, the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach, and given that the latter directly models individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – mechanistic models are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has so far impeded their use in real-world settings, and we therefore propose to develop parameter inference and model selection methods for mechanistic network models in order to endow the biomedical community with these powerful tools.",Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS,10179312,R01AI138901,"['Adoption ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Evolution ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' Likelihood Functions ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Physics ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' Pythons ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Logistics ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' SET Domain ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' stem ', ' network models ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' high dimensionality ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' implementation intervention ', ' ']",NIAID,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2021,554331
"Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis Abstract While rapid advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing are yielding comprehensive taxonomies of cell states in the human body, understanding the complex molecular and environmental factors that regulate cell behavior remains a central challenge. New methods for simultaneous measurement of multiple molecular modalities, spatial context, and lineage relationships are needed to address this goal, but are currently outside the scope of present technologies which largely focus on a single data type. We propose to create a Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis, with a mission to develop a comprehensive suite of technologies and analytical methods to measure and integrate the molecular and environmental determinants of cellular identity. To achieve these goals, we propose the following series of synergistic Aims that will be developed in parallel: 1) Develop massively- parallel assays to simultaneously profile multiple molecular components across millions of cells; 2) Identify the spatial and environmental determinants of cellular state in complex interacting populations; 3) Develop scalable platforms to profile inherited molecular components, and determine the role of cell lineage in establishing molecular and phenotypic differences across cells; and 4) Develop methods to harmonize single- cell profiles across distinct modalities, enabling the inference of cellular identity. Our Center will address critical challenges in data integration, and produce software and protocols that will be applicable to diverse biological systems. We will share these resources broadly with the community, alongside a broader educational focus to encourage New York City students from under-represented backgrounds to pursue academic training in Genomics and Systems Biology. Project Narrative Understanding how the molecular components, inherited lineage, and spatial milieu of single cells dictate function in health and disease remains a key outstanding challenge in genomics. The overarching goal of our Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis is to develop methods to simultaneously assess these multimodal cellular properties, develop tools to harmonize them to allow inferential assessment of cell identity based on partial phenotyping, and share these developments with the broad scientific community while encouraging community engagement through education and outreach.

"Understanding the mechanisms by which weight change affects progression of knee osteoarthritis in obese and overweight individuals: An analysis of the Osteoarthritis Initiative Dataset Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease which affects more than 27 million people in the US and is the single most common cause of disability in older adults. The number of people affected with symptomatic OA will increase due to the aging of the population and the growing number of people with obesity, which represents an established risk factor for OA. Obesity has become a US “epidemic,” and projections have suggested that 86.3% of adults in the United States will be overweight or obese by 2030. Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for OA with weight loss offering a potential non-invasive therapy for disease prevention in obese and overweight individuals. Research has shown that weight loss slows OA progression and weight gain exacerbates progression. However, these studies did not specifically assess factors or pathways which would be responsible for improved or worse outcomes, such as associated inflammation, local body composition and sarcopenia. In the current proposal, we will comprehensibly examine the mechanisms associated with mechanical loading (weight loss and gain) that are responsible for driving knee joint degenerative changes including cartilage loss, namely concurrent changes in inflammation, local body composition (periarticular fat), and muscle morphology and strength. Identifying which mechanism(s) are most beneficial for slowing OA progression during weight loss will lead to targeted therapies for effective and optimized treatment of OA at early stages of disease during which progression may be prevented. Through pathway analysis, mediation analysis, and machine learning, we will identify potential preventive measures (such as muscle strengthening and anti-inflammatory measures) that could amplify the positive effects of reduced mechanical loading on OA. Thus, the clinical impact of our project is development of a subject-specific prediction model for clinicians to individually-tailor treatment plans that slow joint breakdown, and decrease probability for invasive and costly surgeries such as total knee arthroplasty. Three specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: We will characterize the associations between changes in weight with changes in knee joint inflammation, local body composition, muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), fat infiltration and muscle strength, and investigate the associations between these parameters and progression of knee degenerative changes. Specific Aim 2: Using a path analysis we will explore the mechanisms by which weight change impacts OA progression, and quantify the degree to which these factors mediate this relationship. Specific Aim 3: Finally, we will develop a prediction model using machine learning to determine which demographic, clinical, and MRI features (including changes in local body composition, inflammation, muscle) can predict progression of OA over 8 years. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) While obesity is a modifiable risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), studies analyzing the impact of weight loss in overweight and obese people have found inconsistent results on structural progression of knee OA. One potential explanation for these findings, and at the same time a major gap of knowledge in previous research, is that studies have not specifically assessed factors or pathways which, together with mechanical load, are responsible for improved or worse outcomes, such as associated inflammation, local body composition and sarcopenia. The overall goal of our proposal is to elucidate which mechanisms are responsible for slowing progression during weight loss, and which are most beneficial to develop individualized treatment plans targeting specific pathways that will enhance the positive effects of weight loss on slowing OA progression.",Understanding the mechanisms by which weight change affects progression of knee osteoarthritis in obese and overweight individuals: An analysis of the Osteoarthritis Initiative Dataset,10180705,R01AR078917,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' antiinflammatory ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Goals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee joint ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle mass ', ' Morphology ', ' Infiltration ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' knee OA ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' muscle strength ', ' joint degeneration ', ' joint degradation ', ' joint destruction ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' sarcopenic ', ' sarcopenia ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' resistance training ', ' strength training ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' Structural defect ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative measure ', ' mechanical load ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' joint inflammation ', ' inflamed joint ', ' joint swelling ', ' risk prediction model ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' ']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,714433
"Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and atherosclerosis Project Summary/Abstract This competitive renewal is based on work demonstrating that a subpopulation of endothelial cells (ECs) in atherosclerotic plaques undergo a transition to a mesenchymal cell fate that involves loss of barrier function, expression of inflammatory genes and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. This transition is initiated by inflammatory signaling that sensitizes cells to TGFβ, which then drives the mesenchymal fate transition. A key consequence of the mesenchymal phenotype is production of a fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix that amplifies inflammatory signaling, recruiting leukocytes and production of cytokines. This sequence of events thus creates positive feedback, a key feature of disease progression and resistance to therapy. Our work during the past grant cycle has provided evidence that fate switching is driven by a minor subset of pre-existing, susceptible ECs that drive vessel wall remodeling. Our work has also elucidated novel pathways by which matrix remodeling alters integrin signaling to enhance inflammatory pathways and promotes disease progression. The overall goal of the current application is to understand the EC subpopulations and factors that drive fate switching, and the positive feedback mechanisms that drive disease. Aim 1 will elucidate endothelial heterogeneity in mice and in patients with atherosclerosis. Aim 2 will characterize disease-prone subset of normal endothelial cells. Aim 3 will elucidate the role of pro-inflammatory integrin signaling in evolution of EC populations in the atherosclerotic plaque and the downstream pathways that mediate plaque progression. Project Narrative Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory/metabolic disease in which cells of the artery wall remodel to form a plaque that can narrow vessel lumens or rupture and block blood flow. This grant aims to understand the changes in endothelial cell fate that govern vessel remodeling and the pathways by which these changes promote disease.

"Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Thyroid Cancer using Ultrasound Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There has been significant work in creating tools that leverage computer vision algorithms to automate medical image analysis. Most of these algorithms have been developed for natural images, which are usually single static images that can be treated individually. However, medical images are usually part of a study that may include various views and orientations that are considered together with other clinical data when making a diagnosis. Three dimensional convolution neural networks (CNN) can address this issue in part when images are evenly spaced, but many medical imaging modalities such as ultrasound (US), fluoroscopy, and biopsy imaging have variable orientations and irregular spacing. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have the potential to address this issue as they generalize the assumptions of CNNs to work on arbitrarily structured graphs. Automatic thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound (US) is one application that such a graph-based approach could have a large impact. The thyroid cancer incidence rate has tripled in the past thirty years, with an estimated cost of $18-21 billon in 2019. US is the imaging modality of choice, which consists of multiple 2D images of different locations and orientations. US readings are often vague and subjective in nature, which has resulted in a steady increase in the number of biopsies performed over the past 20 years. It is estimated that about one-third of all thyroid biopsy procedures performed in the United States are medically unnecessary, leading to the unmet need for noninvasive diagnostic tests that can reliably identify which nodules require a biopsy. The research objective of this R21 is to develop a new graph-based approach to leverage spatial information contained within imaging studies that will be combined with biomarkers and other known risk factors. Our graph model will enable more complete detection of thyroid cancer, as well as the prediction of future cancer aggression, both with spatially localized explanations. GCN features will be used to predict voxel-level cancer suspicion, thereby enabling a novel method for performing “imaging biopsy.” Finally, voxel-level suspicion maps will be aggregated into patient-level quantitative imaging biomarkers and combined with clinical data to create a multimodal nomogram for performing risk stratification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical image analysis plays an important role in computer aided detection and diagnosis, but usually focuses on individual images in isolation. Graph convolutional networks have the ability to utilize the relationships be- tween images in a study to aggregate information and make a more accurate evaluation. The focus of this project is to implement a graph-based approach for distinguishing indolent from aggressive thyroid cancer, thus pre- venting patients from receiving unnecessary treatment and incurring associated negative functional outcomes.",Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Thyroid Cancer using Ultrasound Imaging,10110934,R21EB030691,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of thyroid ', ' Malignant Thyroid Gland Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid Cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fluoroscopy ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nodule ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Savings ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' Thyroid Nodule ', ' Thyroid Gland Nodule ', ' Tweens ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Indolent ', ' Individual ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' radiologist ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' cancer risk ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modeling ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' ward ', ' Address ', ' Nomograms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' image registration ', ' functional outcomes ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' network models ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' computer aided detection ', ' computer assisted detection ', ' Patient risk ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' unnecessary treatment ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' clinical imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' cost estimate ', ' cost estimation ', ' detection platform ', ' detection system ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,224566
"Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent, contributes to substantial morbidity in the population, and lacks effective interventions to prevent onset and progression. Importantly, and like many other chronic conditions, OA is not a single disease but rather a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It is becoming increasingly clear that consideration of specific OA phenotypes in clinical studies and trials is critically needed to move the field forward. The overall goal of this line of work is to identify and understand potential phenotypes of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) to better inform future research efforts and treatments; this exploratory R21 project using OA Initiative (OAI) data will investigate novel methodology to support phenotyping in KOA. Successful treatments for OA will need to be targeted to, and tested in, specifically chosen OA phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that an understanding of KOA phenotypes, a key step toward Precision Medicine in OA, will lead to more successful clinical studies in the long-term. To approach this important clinical problem, we propose a project in which we will apply innovative machine learning methods and validation strategies to data from the large, publicly available OAI cohort. We will leverage this large dataset, along with local expertise in statistics, biostatistics and machine learning methodology, to tackle the problem of phenotyping this heterogeneous disease. In Aim 1, we will utilize a data-driven, unsupervised learning approach, to cluster features that best define and discriminate among phenotypes of KOA in the OAI dataset, using biclustering and a novel significance test (SigClust) developed by co-I Marron. For Aim 2, we will test specific hypotheses of relevance to OA outcomes, such as differences between those with and without OA, or those who do or do not develop new or worsening disease, using another set of machine learning methods (Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]), also developed by co-I Marron, in the full cohort and in any identified clusters from Aim 1. In order to address these aims, this proposal involves interdisciplinary collaborations among experts in statistics, biostatistics, computer science, rheumatology, and epidemiology. This work will significantly impact the field by fulfilling a critical need to accurately define OA phenotypes, discover the key features associated with these phenotypes, link phenotype subgroups to underlying mechanisms and use this information to inform and focus future clinical studies. In the long term, we expect that this strategy will lead to more personalized and successful management of the millions of people affected by OA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem, and like many other chronic conditions it is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. The lack of appreciation of this heterogeneity has contributed to the failure of all attempts to date to develop disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs; future trials will need to target specific OA phenotypes. There is a critical need to define and understand phenotypes in OA and link these to outcomes, leading to more personalized and successful management of this common and debilitating disease.",Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping,10083187,R21AR074685,"['precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Affect ', ' Arthritis ', ' arthritic ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' bone ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Joints ', ' Knee Injuries ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rheumatology ', ' Risk Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Syndrome ', ' Synovial Membrane ', ' Membrana Synovialis Capsulae Articularis ', ' Synovium ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Meniscus ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' knee OA ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Techniques ', ' joint degeneration ', ' joint degradation ', ' joint destruction ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' drug development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Validation ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Non obese ', ' Nonobese ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' loss of function ', ' demographics ', ' effective intervention ', ' common treatment ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,160567
"Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Modern biomedical research is increasingly quantitative. The next generation of researchers will need an entirely new set of quantitative skills to fully take advantage of the data they create. In response to this need, the goal of the current R25 proposal is to transform an existing, 5-day bioinformatics techniques course into a new, two-week short course, Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data, to provide a unique educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core competencies in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large datasets. The new course will also address NIH priorities including rigor and reproducibility and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles. During the last five years, the Dartmouth faculty who are serving as Principal Investigators have taught a 5-day course at the MDI Biological Laboratory on bioinformatics and biostatistics to ~40 trainees/year (202 total). Based on overwhelmingly positive feedback, the current project will extend this 5-day course into a longer, two-week short course at the MDI Biological Laboratory that will feature a low student-to- instructor ratio (5:1), more hands-on experiential learning, and exceptional faculty who are highly experienced in teaching and performing big-data analyses. The new course is designed to accommodate ~35 trainees per year (175 total over the five-year R25 project). It will incorporate modules on biostatistics, scientific rigor and reproducibility, and FAIR data principles. The course design will also involve a short conceptual presentation, followed by an exercise in which students will gain confidence by applying a new skill. Each active-learning session will have three levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) to allow each student to progress at their own pace. The low student-to-faculty ratio will allow course facilitators to guide participants through realistic challenges without causing frustration. The specific aims of the proposed course include: Specific Aim 1. Develop a two-week short course primarily for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students that improves their ability to design and analyze omics experiments such as RNA-seq, 16S (microbiome), metagenomics, and sc-RNA-seq data; Specific Aim 2. Enhance the impact of research by biomedical scientists by teaching them the Responsible Conduct of Research, the secure and ethical use of data, as well as rigor and reproducibility and FAIR data principles; Specific Aim 3. Disseminate the training curriculum to a broad audience; and Specific Aim 4. Evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of the course on students, including a long-term follow-up to determine students’ confidence in and actual integration of bioinformatics, biostatistics, and FAIR data principles into their research, and the reported impact of this course on their career trajectory and competitiveness in the job market. In summary, the proposed course will provide a unique cross- training, educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core competency in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large data sets.

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program.

Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,10092079,R01AI137681,"['Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Filtration ', ' Filtration Fractionation ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Foundations ', ' Freezing ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' indexing ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Lymphatic cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' lymph cell ', ' Moldova ', ' monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' National Health Programs ', ' Organizational Objectives ', ' Organizational Goals ', ' Patients ', ' Peptide Fragments ', ' Peptides ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Gender ', ' falls ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immunological markers ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Event ', ' age group ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' PBMC ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' treatment planning ', ' ELISPOT ', ' enzyme linked immunospot assay ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Sensitivity ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' nanodisk ', ' nano disk ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' high risk ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' progression marker ', ' progression biomarker ', ' biosignature ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' T cell response ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' blood-based biomarker ', ' blood-based marker ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' biomarker performance ', ' biomarker utility ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' random forest ', ' classification algorithm ', ' support vector machine ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' biomarker signature ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,728879
"Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface Project Summary: The long-term goal of this research is to develop a new, non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that will provide augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) capabilities to patients who have lost these capabilities due to severe motor impairments, such as completely locked-in syndrome (CLIS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and severe cerebral palsy (CP). The proposed research project will work towards a long-term goal by developing a BCI based on brain imaging signals from high-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT). Some existing BCIs record electroencephalography (EEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) signals from patients and then decode these signals into instructions for operating some element of the outside world, such as a cursor on a screen, a prosthetic limb, or a virtual keyboard. This functionality can enable communication. However, BCI generally has had limited success and capabilities in CLIS patients with EEG or has relied on invasive technology such as ECoG or intracortical recordings, which require surgical placement of electrodes on or beneath the brain surface. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has recently achieved great success with decoding items viewed or heard by subjects (e.g., distinguishing from among >100 viewed images), fMRI requires bulky, expensive equipment that cannot be employed for routine BCI for patients with severe motor- related communication deficits. In contrast, optical imaging approaches, such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), employ portable, wearable hardware. These optical systems are non-invasive and use non-ionizing, near-infrared light to create movies of blood oxygenation and therefore provide physiological information comparable to the fMRI signal. NIRS has recently been applied as an alternative to EEG BCI for decoding simple yes/no responses in CLIS patients. However, NIRS systems suffer from much-lower spatial resolution than fMRI, which renders NIRS unlikely to match the decoding capabilities of fMRI. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT) combines the lightweight, low-cost equipment benefits of EEG and NIRS with higher spatial resolution closer to that of fMRI at the brain surface. Recent advances in HDDOT systems have enabled average spatial localization errors <5 mm and spatial resolution <17-20 mm (substantially better than NIRS). Studies have demonstrated detailed maps of both visual and language tasks. These properties make HDDOT an ideal candidate tool for decoding brain function. The fellowship training will provide a strong foundation in optical neuroimaging methods, machine learning, and brain-computer interface. These experiences will prepare the applicant exceptionally well for a career in biomedical engineering research and for developing technology that will improve these patients’ quality of life. Project Narrative: This project will develop decoding methods and evaluate their feasibility for using a high- performance optical brain scanner to identify and distinguish between imaging tasks in human subjects. The long-term goal of this research is to enable locked-in patients to communicate with others using augmented communication facilitated by a portable brain-scanning device, and a computer that decodes their brain signals.",Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface,10078847,F31NS110261,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease ', "" Gehrig's Disease "", ' Lou Gehrig Disease ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Elements ', ' Equipment ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Imagination ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Locked-In Syndrome ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Travel ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' career ', ' density ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Letters ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Brain scan ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' movie ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Optical Tomography ', ' diffuse optical tomography ', ' AAC Device ', ' AAC Intervention ', ' Augmentative and Alternative Communication ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' virtual ', ' brain computer interface ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' mental imagery ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' non-invasive system ', ' noninvasive system ', ' imaging system ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,29520
"Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals ABSTRACT While multidrug-resistance transporters including P-gp and MRP2 are generally studied for their role in exporting drugs and foreign compounds from the cell, our studies indicate that these efflux pumps expressed at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells provide a critical link in communication between sentinel functions of mucosal barriers and the immune system. Understanding how this P-gp/eCB anti-inflammatory arm is regulated will provide crucial insight into how dysfunction may promote intestinal inflammation and help identify potential new therapeutic targets. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the central hypothesis we aim to test is whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to prevent unnecessary inflammation. Our pilot studies indicate that the microbiota does influence P-gp expression and function, providing a unique foundation for further cause-effect studies. No data have previously demonstrated a link between the microbiota and eCBs or any other epithelial lipid signals, and may well provide great insight into a novel system. Bridging this gap could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To begin addressing these questions, in Aim 1 of this application will combine in vitro (including human colonoids) and in vivo murine model systems, as well as use healthy and UC patient stool, to more deeply understand the microbial consortia that collectively maximize P-gp expression and function. Aim 2 is designed to identify the microbial metabolites that drive activation of P-gp expression and eCB secretion to maintain an anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses will be performed to provide new information regarding microbial genes, gene clusters, and their metabolic products implicated in maintaining an anti- inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium through regulation of the P-gp/eCB axis. In Aim 3 we will employ novel computational methods will to uncover the inter-microbial network responses and the ecological structure of a stable community that is able to induce P-gp expression. Collectively, knowledge of the pathways that coordinate the maintenance of the P-gp/eCB axis will require a comprehensive understanding of distinct signals regulating intestinal homeostasis, how multiple signals are integrated in the complex intestinal environment, and pathways that modulate host-microbe interactions. Consequently, this proposal will directly advance novel biological principles with guidance of new therapeutic intervention strategies. Public Health Narrative Regulated recruitment and migration of acute inflammatory cells termed neutrophils (PMN) into the intestine and across the specialized epithelium that lines it is critical for host defense, yet dysregulation of this process is associated with disease. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the goal of this proposal will examine whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to maintain a homeostatic anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Understanding this process could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals,10212384,R01DK125407,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', '

"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the US. The management of glaucoma is based on early detection, followed by careful evaluation and monitoring to identify those with rapid disease progression and high risk for vision loss. This allows for the rational use of medical, laser, and surgical treatments. Current methods of assessing glaucoma have significant limitations. Visual field (VF) testing has a low sensitivity for detecting early disease, and its reproducibility worsens in advanced stages, reducing its reliability for monitoring disease progression. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) precisely measure the peripapillary nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness and is the most commonly used technology for objective glaucoma evaluation. However, NFL thickness has limited sensitivity in detecting early glaucoma, and reaches a floor value in moderate glaucoma, which prevents it from tracking glaucoma progress into later stages. The goal of the proposed research is to develop advanced OCT technology that will enhance detection of early glaucoma, improve the sensitivity of detecting significant disease progression, and increase the accuracy of measuring progression speed. The Specific Aims are: 1. Develop a directional high-resolution OCT and OCT angiography prototype to improve imaging of  structure and perfusion. The prototype will have real-time control of beam direction to maintain  perpendicular incidence on the NFL for accurate reflectance analysis, which has shown promise for very  sensitive detection of early glaucoma. Sensorless adaptive-optics aberration correction will enable high  transverse resolution to enhance the detection of nerve fiber bundle and capillary defects. Ultrahigh axial  resolution will enable assessment of the pentalaminar structure of the inner plexiform layer. 2. Wide-field OCT and OCT angiography analyses and visual field simulation. Wide peripapillary and  macular scans, using a next-generation commercial spectral-domain OCT system, will allow visualization of  nerve fiber and perfusion defects from the disc margin to temporal raphe, thus improving early glaucoma  detection. VF simulation will be performed to convert OCTA perfusion measurement to a VF-equivlaent dB-  scale familiar to clinicians for monitoring progression. The simulation has higher reproducibility than actual  VF, which improves detection of disease progression and measurement of progression speed. 3. Clinical studies in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. The clinical study will test whether the  proposed new technologies can improve the detection of pre-perimetric glaucoma, detection of disease  progression, and the accuracy of measuring the speed of progression. This research is likely to transform the clinical practice of glaucoma by developing novel objective functional and structural tests that can be practically implemented on the next generation of clinical OCT systems. This will save vision by achieving accurate diagnosis in early glacuoma and timely intervention in rapid progressors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution imaging technology that is already commonly used to diagnose and monitor glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, and provide more accurate monitoring of disease progression. Directional OCT technology will be developed to accurately measure nerve fiber layer reflectance; sensorless adaptive-optics OCT technology will be used to improve imaging of nerve fiber bundles and capillaries; ultrahigh axial resolution will enable imaging of detailed internal retinal structures such as the lamellae of the inner plexiform layer; and capillary perfusion measurements will be used to simulate visual field function.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,10211838,R01EY023285,"['Open-Angle Glaucoma ', ' Compensated Glaucoma ', ' Compensative Glaucoma ', ' Glaucoma Simplex ', ' Simple Glaucoma ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' realtime systems ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Inner Plexiform Layer ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Ganglion Cell Layer ', ' Monitor ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' next generation ', ' macula ', ' macular ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Imaging technology ', ' prototype ', ' adaptive optics ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' Visualization ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Floor ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' ']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,624917
"Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Abstract PET is a molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology studies due to its high sensitivity and the potential of early diagnosis. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET has been recently used in clinical routine for imaging NETs in adult and pediatric patients since 2016. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of NETs. However, compared to 18F-FDG PET, the image quality of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is lower due to much larger positron range, shorter half-life, and lower dose administration limited by generator capacity. All of these compromises the lesion detectability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET, especially for small lesions, and can potentially lead to inaccurate NET diagnosis. As 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is increasingly used in clinics, there is an urgent and unmet need to further optimize 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging for NET detection. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed for PET image denoising, where the PET system model is not considered. As the tumor-to-background ratio of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is greater than 18F-FDG PET, the lesion recovery of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET can be hugely influenced by the smoothing effects as well as potential mismatches between training and testing datasets. In this study, we propose a novel data- informed and lesion detection-driven image reconstruction framework. The PET system model, image denoising module, and lesion-detection module will all be included in this reconstruction framework. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework and validate it based on comprehensive computer simulations, (2) to apply the proposed reconstruction framework to existing clinical 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT datasets and test it based on various figure-of-merits. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be a novel and robust image reconstruction framework to better recover lesions in a 68Ga- DOTATATE PET scan, which is essential for NET managements. Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection  Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology. This project aims to develop a novel lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework. Success of this project can enhance the lesion detectability of current PET imaging protocols, e.g. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).",Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection,10206141,R03EB030280,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Gallium ', ' Ga element ', ' Goals ', ' Half-Life ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Play ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Positron ', ' Radionuclide Imaging ', ' Gamma Camera Imaging ', ' Radioisotope Scanning ', ' Scintigraphy ', ' radionuclide imaging/scanning ', ' radionuclide scanning ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Savings ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Vendor ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Neuroendocrine Tumors ', ' Neuroendocrine Neoplasm ', ' pentetreotide ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Recovery ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Staging ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' 18-FDG ', ' 18F- FDG ', ' 18FDG ', ' 2 Fluoro 2 deoxy D glucose ', ' 2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose ', ' Distant Cancer ', ' Distant Metastasis ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Contrast-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gadolinium-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gd-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Enhancing Lesion ', ' FOLH ', ' FOLH1 ', ' Folate Hydrolase 1 ', ' GCP2 ', ' Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II ', ' N-Acetylated Alpha-Linked Acidic Dipeptidase 1 ', ' NAALAD1 ', ' NAALADase I ', ' PSM ', ' PSMA ', ' Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen ', ' FOLH1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Tracer ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer type ', ' tumor ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' routine imaging ', ' neuroendocrine differentiation ', ' Injections ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,89563
"Synthetic biology and organelle genomics: A rubisco library as a case study in evolutionary landscapes and organellar engineering Food security is a critical issue facing human health in the 21st century as the global population  approaches 10 billion and climate change threatens the food supply. Photosynthetic engineering has  been successful in improving crop yields but the central enzyme of carbon fixation, rubisco, has  remained intractable as a target of molecular evolution. The few plants tested with heterologous  rubiscos grow uniformly slower than their wild-type counterparts. The goal of this proposal is to  generate a chloroplast genome library in plants to explore the limits of rubisco function and  organellar genome organization. In Aim 1 of this proposal I will explore the sequence-function landscape of a model, homodimeric  rubisco enzyme and a novel, linked variant I have generated. I have generated a deep-mutational  scan (OMS: all possible point-mutants) library and will assay their function in a uniquely suited  rubisco-dependent E. coli strain. I have shown that these linked rubiscos function in vivo and in  vitro and have already constructed the mutant library; in the K99 phase of this project I will  perform selections on this library and analyze the data with a machine learning model. In the R00  phase I will generate further libraries to explore regions of the sequence landscape predicted to  be rich in improved rubiscos with the goal of testing them in plants. In Aim 2 I will improve chloroplast transformation technology in order to enable the generation of  chloroplast genome libraries of unprecedented size in the chloroplast-editing model plant N.  tabacum. To do this I will generate sequence-specific TALEN nucleases that will be expressed from  the nuclear genome and trafficked to the chloroplast where they will cut and disrupt the genome,  preferencing homologous recombination of transgenic donor ONA. After demonstrating TALEN-cutting in  the K99 phase I will develop this technology into an intracellular gene drive which will accelerate  chloroplast genome editing. In Aim 3, with the technology developed in Aim 2 and the rubisco variants discovered in Aim 1, I  will generate libraries of plants with altered rubisco genes and promoters in order to demonstrate  the potential of rubisco engineering to improve plant growth. In addition, in the R00 phase, I will  produce a comprehensive chloroplast gene knockout library in order to answer fundamental questions  about the evolutionary flow of genes from organellar genomes to nuclear genomes. My goal as an independent investigator is to study organellar biology in model plants in order to  explore the limits of engineering in individual proteins and metabolic pathways. My training in  organellar transformation, protein library generation and laboratory management during the K99  phase will prepare me well for the R00 phase. The Innovative Genomics Institute at UC Berkeley and  the laboratories of Ors. Oavid Savage and Brian Staskawicz in particular are the ideal environment  for my career transition, combining precisely the necessary mixture of expertise - protein  evolution and plant transformation, respectively.

"Mapping Single Extracellular Vesicles to Parent Cells for Immunotherapy Monitoring This proposal aims to develop an ultra-high sensitive platform that can map cell and extracellular vesicle (EV) molecular information at the single particle level, and apply it to proﬁle tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) for immunotherapy monitoring. This technology can resolve heterogeneity of biological systems and has the potential to discover robust biomarkers that can accurately proﬁle status of the body for disease diagnostics. This proposal hypothesizes that single cell-single EV mapping will provide new molecular information on cell-cell communication for better understanding of pathological development and disease diagnosis. The goals of this proposal are threefold: i) development of single EV protein sequencing technology to resolve EV heterogeneity and discover rare EV subtypes for disease biomarkers, ii) ultra-fast cycling for multiplexed live cell ﬂuorescence imaging to monitor the changes of cellular phenotypes and identify multiple immune cell types, and iii) single cell-single EV mapping to discover new molecular information on cell-cell communication through vesicle secretion. This technology will allow repeat sampling and monitoring of TIME during the course of immunotherapy and provide guidance to achieve the best possible patient outcomes. With the expertise in microﬂuidics, molecular biology, and machine learning, Jina Ko (the PI of this proposal) has developed new micro- and nano-technologies for liquid biopsy that can extract multidimensional molecular data from blood-based biomarkers (e.g. circulating tumor cells, EV). She has extended her expertise to chemistry, droplet microﬂuidics, and translational medicine to develop novel platforms that will serve as a fundamental work to this proposal. She has recently developed i) ultra-high sensitive single EV proﬁling technology using droplet digital PCR and ii) ultra-fast cycling for multiplexed cellular ﬂuorescence imaging. Through this work, Jina has forged research collaborations within and outside the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School at the Wyss Institute and Harvard University. Building upon these achievements, this work will be executed with a team of world experts in droplet microﬂuidics and physics (Weitz), molecular imaging and diagnostics (Weissleder), immunology (Pittet), exosome biology and neurogenetics (Breakeﬁeld), and neurosurgery and oncology (Chiocca) who will provide a full support on this work. Working with these mentors will allow her to tackle clinically challenging problems and further develop her career as an independent investigator with the ability to develop next generation medical diagnostics. The aim of this proposal is to develop an ultra-high sensitive single cell-single extracellular vesicle (EV) mapping technology that can resolve both cell and EV heterogeneity.

"Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases The placenta is essential for fetal development and growth, maternal homeostasis, and broadly, pregnancy health. Yet, our ability to non-invasively probe placental health during human pregnancy is hampered by its deep intrauterine location and its highly vascular composition, rendering the placenta largely inaccessibly for safe and dynamic investigation. Whereas placental research has been advanced by cell culture, ex vivo systems, animal models, and postpartum analyses, these indirect approaches provide ex post facto information about placental health. Placental imaging has revolutionized the field of placental medicine, but resolution at the molecular, cellular, or metabolic level remains limited. To address these challenges, we and others have focused on the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from placental trophoblasts, which, in humans, are directly bathed in maternal blood. We focused on exosomes (now termed small EVs or sEVs), microvesicles, and apoptotic blebs, which are continuously and abundantly released from trophoblasts into the maternal circulation and are accessible throughout pregnancy by peripheral blood tests. Among these EVs, we focus mainly on placental sEVs, which harbor messages that are seldom expressed by any other cell types and execute unique placental biological functions, such as an antiviral response. While informative, recent data indicate that sEVs are not a uniform population of vesicles, but comprise several subgroups, defined as large sEVs, small sEVs, and exomeres. In addition to their size, these sEV subtypes are characterized by distinctive cargo. Although the recent discovery of sEV subpopulations has excited researchers due to their potential to revolutionize the field of non-invasive diagnostics, sEV subpopulations have yet to be utilized in clinical settings. This is largely due to the difficulties associated with separation and isolation the nano-sized sEV subpopulations. Our group has now developed advanced acoustofluidic technologies designed to effectively, reproducibly, and rapidly isolate sEVs from blood. We show that we can separate placental sEVs into their specific subpopulations, which has not been previously accomplished. Our proposed investigation therefore focuses on the production of human placental sEV subpopulations, along with their RNA and proteome cargo. We posit that, by profiling these analytes from sEV subpopulations, we can illuminate a unique landscape of bioactive molecules that are relevant to placental health. To reduce data complexity, we propose a machine learning pipeline that will be used to probe the sub-sEV spectra during normal and pathological pregnancies. Further, we will improve our ability to purify sEV subpopulations from lipoproteins, and generate a single, integrated device that can reliably separate vesicles in real time across human gestation. We believe that our automated acoustofluidic approach to separating sEV subpopulations in a high-yield, biocompatible manner is critical to unlocking the clinical utility of sEVs. Insights gained from our investigation will improve non-invasive diagnostics during pregnancy and may uncover new targets for personalized placental therapeutics. Our proposal centers on the discovery and analysis of previously unrecognized nanovesicle subpopulations that are produced by placental cells and are released to the maternal-fetal circulation. By studying these nanovesicle subpopulations in health and diseases of human pregnancy and by innovating new technologies to efficiently, rapidly, and reproducibly purify these nanovesicles from the blood and other biological media, we enable pioneering tools to interrogate the placenta in real time and improve clinical care during pregnancy.",Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle

"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives.

"Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging our therapeutic strategies. Drug resistance occurs as a result of this evolution when drug pressure changes the balance of molecular recognition events, selectively weakening inhibitor binding while maintaining the biological function of the therapeutic target. Disrupting the therapeutic target’s activity is necessary but not sufficient to avoid resistance. We hypothesize that the multi-dimensional landscape of resistance evolution can be elucidated through integration of experimental and computational data to reveal the key pathways and coupled molecular mechanisms to resistance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this strategy can be incorporated into structure-based drug design to evaluate novel inhibitors.  Resistance occurs under gradual and persistent drug pressure, and interestingly the mutations are not limited to the active site of a drug target, but can occur throughout the enzyme to confer high levels of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which this resistance occurs is not clear. Our aim is to exploit the rich and versatile experimental data, integrating inhibitor potency and crystallographic structures with ensemble dynamics in an internally consistent manner using machine learning to elucidate both the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and generate predictive models of inhibitor potency.

"Super-multiplexed fluorescence nanoscopy for imaging-based proteomics PROJECT SUMMARY In situ immunofluorescence imaging is a powerful method to study the locations, expression levels and structures of proteins in cells and tissues. In particular, multiplexed imaging reveals the interaction networks of proteins, which allows us to understand the underlying mechanisms of many diseases. However, it has been challenging to perform multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging due to its extremely time-consuming process, high cost and lack of signal amplification. The limited spatial resolution achievable with confocal microscopy often fails to reveal complex spatial organization and to determine localizations of proteins. Here we propose super-multiplexed immunofluorescence nanoscopy that is capable of imaging more than twenty different proteins in 24 hours with nanoscale resolution. We will employ DNA-barcoded secondary nanobodies that are monovalent, open-source and designed for quantitative labeling. Repeated introduction and washing of fluorescent DNA imagers will generate highly multiplexed images. Moreover, we will develop unprecedentedly fast stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy that employs a parallelized line array of doughnut beams. It will feature a large imaging area and excellent optical sectioning capability. Photon reassignment, hyperspectral imaging and deep-learning will further facilitate rapid super-resolution-based protein profiling. Our new biochemical and optical tools will play crucial roles in diverse biomedical areas including brain proteomics and cancer profiling.

Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss. This study seeks to refine and validate a deep learning algorithm for early diagnosis of glaucoma on optic disc photographs and subsequently test it in a pilot teleophthalmology program.",Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology,10415277,K23EY030897,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye diseases ', ' eye disorder ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' Fellowship ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Suspect Glaucomas ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Patients ', ' Perimetry ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Work ', ' Specialist ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Fundus photography ', ' eye fundus photography ', ' fundus camera ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' carina ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Clinic ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Width ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Fundus ', ' assisted living ', ' assistive living ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', "" Master's Degree "", ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' cost effective ', ' Imaging technology ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' demographics ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' RNFL ', ' eye center ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' screening ', ' public health intervention ', ' learning network ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' algorithm training ', ' teleophthalmology ', ' ']",NEI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K23,2021,171651
"Design, Development, and Validation of an AI-enabled Legal Planning and Financial Management Training Solution for ADRD Caregivers PROJECT ABSTRACT More than 16 million caregivers (‘family members or friends’) of people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) face serious challenges in providing care. ADRD caregivers are frequently tasked with substantial and overwhelming legal and financial planning, and they face increased financial risk and strain as a result. Currently, there is no widely available web-based financial and legal training that can be personalized to meet caregivers’ specific needs. During this Fast Track project, we will begin with a deep discovery of legal planning and financial management needs of ADRD caregivers, conduct participatory co- design sessions with diverse caregivers groups, create multimedia training solutions, design an AI-enabled recommender system to match caregivers with the right training content, and then conduct rolling field trials with a diverse groups of caregivers to confirm the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of our legal planning and financial management training solution. Looking ahead to Phase 3, we expect our solution will support financial stability through delivery of personalized and actionable training for estate planning and financial management needs. We anticipate a combination of B2B partnerships and B2C strategies will yield a sustainable revenue model for our caregiver training solution. PROJECT SUMMARY ADRD caregivers face substantial and overwhelming legal and financial planning tasks, which can increase financial strain and emotional stress. During this Fast Track project, we will conduct deep discovery of legal planning and financial management needs of ADRD caregivers and field test an AI-enabled solution.

"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision

"Deep Learning of Pancreas MRI to Predict Progression of T1D. Project Summary The TrialNet Pathway to Prevention study has provided crucial early screening for relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The presence of autoantibodies conveys high risk for progression from Stage 1 T1D, defined by the presence of multiple diabetogenic autoantibodies, to Stage 3 T1D, or symptomatic disease. However, the time to progression can be variable. A variety of genetic and metabolic indices have attempted to predict progression of T1D, with varying degree of success. Additional biomarkers are needed to improve prediction of progression, and these biomarkers must be correlated with immunological markers or metrics that assess beta cell function. The overall goal of the proposed study is to establish an imaging biomarker to predict progression. We propose to improve T1D prediction by 1) co-registering longitudinal MRI taken during progression of T1D to identify spatial evolution characteristic of disease evolution, 2) harnessing deep learning techniques to identify image features characteristic of the pancreas in T1D, and 3) integrated imaging and functional metrics to build a predictive model of T1D progression. This work builds upon work we have performed indicating that pancreas size, shape, and structure are altered in new onset type 1 diabetes. These imaging metrics are also altered in individuals at risk for developing T1D. This study will identify imaging features characteristic of the pancreas that accompany progression to T1D. The techniques developed may prove useful for monitoring patients at risk for T1D and predicting progression to symptomatic disease, which is associated with lower incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis, better glycemic control, and corresponding improvements in long-term complications. The ability to predict progression would further facilitate the design of new therapeutic trials which are shorter and less expensive by stratifying patient populations and providing intermediate end points. Project Narrative This proposal seeks to build a model that predicts progression of type 1 diabetes (T1D) incorporating quantitative pancreas MRI. The model will integrate longitudinally-acquired imaging metrics assessing pancreas size, shape, and structure with functional assays of beta cell function.

"Computational approaches to unravel immune receptor sequencing for cancer immunotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY  The adaptive immune system is responsible for the specific recognition and elimination of antigens originating from infection and disease. It recognizes antigens via an immense array of antigen-binding antibodies (B-cell receptors, BCRs) and T-cell receptors (TCRs), the immune repertoire. Because of the enormous breadth of epitopes recognized by immune repertoires, immune repertoires are extremely diverse and dynamic. Advances in immune receptor sequencing (Rep-seq), such as next generation sequencing, have driven the quantitative and molecular-level profiling of immune repertoires, thereby revealing the high-dimensional complexity of the immune receptor sequence landscape. However, current analysis tools lack the ability to track and examine the dynamic nature of the repertoire across serial time points or to identify the common features across repertoires thoroughly and efficiently. We will develop computationally efficient methods with advanced machine learning techniques, including network analysis, feature selection and classification, and advanced statistical approaches, to interrogate and measure immune repertoire architecture longitudinally, to identify common features across repertoires and to assess their clinical relevance. Network analysis is a powerful approach that can identify TCRs sharing antigen specificity and highly mutable BCR, which can help to develop or improve existing immunotherapeutics and immunodiagnostics. However, network construction is computationally expensive, therefore, we will develop an adaptive subsampling strategy to relieve computation burden. We will implement the proposed methods on two studies to better illustrate the diversity and richness of the data to demonstrate the flexibility and power of the proposed tools. Furthermore, we will develop bioinformatics software by incorporating the proposed methods and techniques to tackle the complexity of the Rep-seq data in a translational fashion and provide a comprehensive platform with user-friendly visualization tools. PROJECT NARRATIVE T cells and B cells as the crucial components of the adaptive immune system. Next generation sequencing of the T and B cell receptors can be used to profile the T and B cell repertoire (Rep-seq).

We propose to apply network analysis with advanced statistical approaches and computational techniques on Rep-seq data to unravel how the adaptive immune system is altered by immunotherapy within clinical responders and non-responders.",Computational approaches to unravel immune receptor sequencing for cancer immunotherapy,10305538,R21CA264381,"['Algorithms ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Immunoglobulins ', ' Immune Globulins ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Probability ', ' B-Cell Antigen Receptor ', ' B cell receptor ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Immunologic Receptors ', ' Immunological Receptors ', ' immune receptor ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' cancer immunotherapy ', ' anti-cancer immunotherapy ', ' anticancer immunotherapy ', ' immune-based cancer therapies ', ' immunotherapy for cancer ', ' immunotherapy of cancer ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' antigen antibody binding ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Protein Motifs ', ' Amino Acid Motifs ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' immune drugs ', ' immune-based therapeutics ', ' immunologic preparation ', ' immunologic therapeutics ', ' immunotherapeutics ', ' immunotherapy agent ', ' Immunotherapeutic agent ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Tumor Immunity ', ' anti-tumor immunity ', ' antitumor immunity ', ' cancer immunity ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' B cell repertoire ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' network architecture ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' responders and non-responders ', ' responders from non-responders ', ' responders or non-responders ', ' responders versus non-responders ', ' responders vs non-responders ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' Adaptive Immune System ', ' acquired immune system ', ' high dimensionality ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Visualization ', ' computational pipelines ', ' feature selection ', ' Immunodiagnostics ', ' immunological diagnostics ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,201324
"Epigenetic mechanisms of sustained transcription across cocaine abstinence PROJECT SUMMARY Cocaine addiction is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and high vulnerability to relapse even after prolonged abstinence. A major focus of the field of addiction research has therefore been to identify stable, cocaine-induced neuroadaptations occurring in brain reward circuits. Transcriptional changes are known to persist throughout abstinence, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms of such persistence remain elusive. We recently discovered that the transcription factor, Nr4a1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4) represses cocaine reward and seeking behavior. Our preliminary data show that Nr4a1 is a central regulator of cocaine-induced transcription, including target gene expression in late abstinence. The significance of this study is strengthened by the utility of therapeutic agents that regulate Nr4a1 and block mouse cocaine self-administration, underscoring the enormous potential of this basic research program in combating drug addiction. Given that histone posttranslational modifications (hPTMs) confer long-lasting changes in gene expression necessary for stable cellular phenotypes, histone modifications acquired during abstinence may explain how individual genes “remember” prior drug exposure. We have previously found that Nr4a1 regulates hPTMs at individual target genes at late abstinence. This proposal aims to define the mechanism(s) of persistent gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of male and female mice following volitional cocaine self-administration. We apply novel methods for cell-type specific quantification of both chromatin and gene expression in a single sample. We then validate the causal mechanism of Nr4a1 action using epigenetic editing in vivo. At the conclusion of this study we will have defined the cell-type specific mechanism by which Nr4a1 regulates stable gene expression across cocaine abstinence. Beyond this, we will apply machine learning to identify novel regulators of persistent gene expression relevant to cocaine addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE One outstanding question in addiction biology concerns the mechanism by which neurological changes persist long past the cessation of drug taking. The persistent nature of epigenetic modifications may underlie their role in chronic psychiatric diseases, such as addiction and depression. This proposal aims to define the molecular mechanisms by which a key neuronal transcription factor, Nr4a1, leads to long-term change in gene expression that persist across cocaine abstinence.",Epigenetic mechanisms of sustained transcription across cocaine abstinence,10297955,R01DA052465,"['Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cocaine ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Female ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Histones ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methyltransferase ', ' EC 2.1.1 ', ' methylase ', ' transmethylase ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Publishing ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Volition ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Chronic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Nuclear Receptors ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' drug abstinence ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' cell type ', ' attenuation ', ' Cocaine Addiction ', ' Cocaine Dependence ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' Nerve growth factor induced protein I-B ', ' Nurr77 ', ' rat orphan nuclear receptor HMR ', ' rat orphan nuclear receptor NGFIB ', ' rat orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' CARTPT gene ', ' Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulated Transcript ', ' Abstinence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' neuroadaptation ', ' neural adaptation ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' epigenetic profiling ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' CRISPRi ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' recruit ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' cocaine self-administration ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,679084
"A visible machine learning system to discover targeted treatment solutions in cancer Project Summary/Abstract Understanding of genetic interactions can lead to therapeutic design for individual cancer patients by targeting the specific genetic vulnerability in the cancer genome. For example, by identifying gene pairs that pose severe fitness defects when knocked out simultaneously (compared to separate knockouts), one can selectively kill cancer cells that harbor loss-of-function mutation in one protein by inhibiting its synthetic-lethal partner. Despite generation of large-scale data delineating the tumor transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, imaging, and so on, little is known regarding how different genes interact with each other and it is unclear how one can design targeted treatments based on the ‘omics data available. To address these challenges, the proposed research will develop a “visible” machine learning framework to systematically understand the higher-order genetic interactions (i.e. di-genic and tri-genic interactions) in cancer and design targeted treatments.  The first step for the proposed framework is to gain a holistic view of cancer pathways through combining the ‘omics data available. Multiple approaches have been applied to integrate data of similar forms, but there yet lacks an effective solution for integrating data of vastly different qualities and formats. To address this challenge, Yue Qin has developed a method to infer a hierarchical cancer cell map capturing cancer pathways at multi- scale resolution by fusing immunofluorescence (IF) imaging data and affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP- MS).  During the F99 phase of the proposed research, by tying the architecture of a deep neural network to the hierarchical cancer cell map, Yue will develop a “visible” neural network (VNN) that can predict the cancer cell fitness from genetic perturbation (i.e. knockouts) and genomic backgrounds (i.e. mutations) while providing mechanistic insights in cancer pathways critical for genotype-phenotype prediction.  During the K00 phase of the award, Yue will develop genetic engineering approaches to experimentally map higher-order genetic interactions in cancer cells based on the mechanistic insights obtained from VNN during genotype-phenotype prediction. The data generated experimentally can directly inspire targeted treatment designs. In addition, the new data can be integrated into the hierarchical cancer cell map to improve accuracy and resolution of the inferred pathways, thus further improving the “visibility” of VNN in genotype-phenotype prediction. The combination of a computational focused training during F99 phase and experimental focused training during K00 phase will fully prepare Yue leading her own interdisciplinary research in cancer biology. In addition, the personalized training plan covering aspects including mentoring and teaching, scientific writing, and oral presentation will ensure Yue acquiring skills necessary for her future establishment as an independent investigator. Project Narrative This project proposes to establish a “visible” machine learning framework that systematically understands and efficiently maps higher-order genetic interactions (i.e. di-genic and tri-genic interactions) in cancer. Investigation of higher-order genetic interactions is critical for designing treatments that precisely target the genetic changes in individual cancer patients. Understanding the complex interplay among genes can further lead to effective design of combinatorial therapeutic solutions that maximize the synergy among treatments.",A visible machine learning system to discover targeted treatment solutions in cancer,10305321,F99CA264422,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Affinity Chromatography ', ' affinity purification ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Engineering ', ' Genetic Engineering Biotechnology ', ' Genetic Engineering Molecular Biology ', ' Recombinant DNA Technology ', ' genetically engineered ', ' Genotype ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' nano meter ', ' nanometer ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' empowered ', ' gene interaction ', ' synergism ', ' knockout gene ', ' skills ', ' Modality ', ' Proteome ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cancer genome ', ' cancer cell genome ', ' tumor genome ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Genome engineering ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' combinatorial ', ' therapy design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' tumor ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' preservation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' neural network ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F99,2021,40429
"Estrogen Administration for the Treatment of NASH in Postmenopausal Women PROJECT ABSTRACT Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide; progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis occurs in a subset of patients and is the second leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States. The factors leading to the development of NAFLD and progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including inflammation and fibrosis, are poorly understood. Moreover, there is a lack of effective therapies for these disorders. Studies in animals and humans suggest that estrogen deficiency may be an important mechanism underlying the development of NAFLD and progression to NASH. However, no prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have examined the impact of estrogen administration on steatosis, inflammation or fibrosis in postmenopausal women with NASH. Our overall hypothesis is that low-dose, transdermal estrogen administration will decrease hepatic fat, inflammation and fibrosis in women with biopsy-proven NASH. Further, we will explore estrogen’s immune and metabolic effects in the liver, including changes at the single-cell level. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that estradiol administration will decrease fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis in women with biopsy-proven NASH. Aim 2 will determine the impact of estrogen on intrahepatic metabolic pathways and on the transcriptional landscape of intrahepatic immune cells. We hypothesize that estrogen will decrease fibrogenesis, decrease hepatic de novo lipogenesis, and increase lipid beta oxidation. These hypotheses will be tested with a rigorously designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of low-dose transdermal estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with NASH. State-of-the-art liver imaging, liver biopsies, whole liver transcriptomics and unbiased single cell RNAseq by SeqWell will be leveraged to investigate these hypotheses. We have assembled a team of investigators with extensive research experience in endocrinology (Dr. Miller), NAFLD (Dr. Corey), liver imaging (Dr. Bredella), and hepatic immunology (Dr. Lauer), which is uniquely positioned to carry out this multi-disciplinary proposal. Elucidating the effects of low-dose, transdermal estrogen administration on liver fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis has the potential to further our understanding of this disease process and identify new therapeutic targets where few currently exist.

"Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for measuring the effect of a treatment or intervention. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test all research questions, whether due to cost, achieving sufficient subject sizes or when administering an arm of the trial would be unethical. To understand the effects of therapeutics, policy changes, and other interventions where it is not possible to administer a clinical trial, researchers have developed approaches that attempt to simulate clinical trials in observational data. Despite sophisticated statistical methodologies, it is not clear whether it is possible to reliably simulate a randomized controlled in observational data. We aim to quantify one potential driver of these different results, differences between the clinical trial and real-world populations. In Aim 1, we compare trials that have individual level data available to three real- world data sources. In Aim 2, we develop methodologies to infer most likely individual-level statistics from aggregate trial statistics using real world data. Finally, in Aim 3 we compare neurological trials that do not release individual level data to real world data. We then estimate the transportability of treatment estimates across different populations including: the population eligible for the trial in RWD and the population ineligible for the trial but receiving the treatment in RWD. This allows for the study of indication drift and treatment heterogeneity. By uncovering differences between these groups, we may be able to identify groups that are underrepresented in clinical trials to help reduce healthcare disparities. The K99/R00 award will allow me to gain expertise in using regulatory sciences (with mentor Dr. Florence Bourgeois and advisor Dr. Deborah Schrag) for biologic discovery (with mentors Dr. Tianxi Cai and Dr. Isaac Kohane) within neurology (with mentors Dr. Page Pennell and Dr. Clemens Scherzer). My background in statistics, informatics, genetics, and machine learning with clinical data sources ideally positions me for the proposed project. The proposed training plan, mentoring and project will provide a strong foundation for a successful transition to independent research. Clinical trial populations are a subset of the overall population and may be biased through several factors. To better understand disease, reduce healthcare disparities for underrepresented groups, assess drug approvals, and ensure safety as the indications for a drug expand it is critical to quantify how representative clinical trials are of the real-world population. Identifying enriched and underrepresented groups offers the opportunity to identify subpopulations who may have heterogeneous treatment effects and/or underlying physiologies.",Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations,10127341,K99NS114850,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Genes ', ' Geography ', ' glucosylceramidase ', ' Acid beta-Glucosidase ', ' D-Glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine glucosylhydrolase ', ' Glucocerebrosidase ', ' Glucocerebroside beta-Glucosidase ', ' Glucosyl Ceramidase ', ' Glucosylceramide beta-Glucosidase ', ' Glucosylsphingosine Glucosyl Hydrolase ', ' beta-Glucocerebrosidase ', ' glucosphingosine glucosylhydrolase ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Insurance ', ' Menarche ', ' Menopause ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neurology ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Seizures ', ' statistics ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Tremor ', ' Woman ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Drug Approval ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' Peripartum ', ' Polypharmacy ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Hormonal ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' reproductive ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Perimenopausal ', ' peri-menopausal ', ' peri-menopause ', ' Perimenopause ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' birth control ', ' cost ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' patient population ', ' standard measure ', ' standard of care ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' arm ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' disparate health care ', ' disparate healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' oncology trial ', ' multiple data sources ', ' efficacy clinical trial ', ' unethical ', ' effectiveness analysis ', ' socioeconomic diversity ', ' socio-economic diversity ', ' ']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,118759
"Novel machine learning approaches for improving structural discrimination in cryo-electron tomography Project Summary Cellular cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) has made possible the observation of cellular organelles and macromolecular complexes at nanometer resolution with native conformations. The rapid increasing amount of Cryo-ET data available however brings along some major challenges for analysis which we will timely ad- dress in this proposal. We will design novel data-driven machine learning algorithms for improving structural discrimination and resolution. In particular, we have the following speciﬁc aims: (1) We will develop a novel Autoencoder and Iterative region Matching (AIM) algorithm for marker-free alignment of image tilt-series to re- construct tomograms with improved resolution; (2) We will develop a saliency-based auto-picking algorithm for better detecting macromolecular complexes, and combine it with an innovative 2D-to-3D framework to further improve structure detection accuracy; (3) We will design an end-to-end convolutional model for pose-invariant clustering of subtomograms. This model will produce an initial clustering which will be reﬁned by a new subto- mogram averaging algorithm that automatically down-weights subtomograms of noise and little contribution; (4) We will perform experimental evaluations by using previously reported bacterial secretion systems and mito- chondrial ultrastructures datasets to improve the ﬁnal resolution. Implementing algorithms in Aims 1-3, we will develop a user-friendly open-source graphical user interface -tom to directly beneﬁt the scientiﬁc community.  -tom will be systematically compared with existing software including IMOD, EMAN2, and Relion on simulated and benchmark datasets. To facilitate distribution, -tom will be integrated into existing software platforms Sci- pion and TomoMiner. Our data-driven algorithms and software not only will facilitate and accelerate the future use of Cryo-ET, but also can be readily used on analyzing the existing large amounts of Cryo-ET data to im- prove our understanding of the structure, function, and spatial organization of macromolecular complexes in situ. Project Narrative This project will create a system of machine learning algorithms to accelerate and facilitate the use and re-use of the rapidly accumulating Cryo-ET datasets. For easy use, we will develop an open-source GUI -Tom (to be disseminated into the Scipion and TomoMiner software platforms) that streamlines the new approaches from the initial tomogram reconstruction step to the ﬁnal subtomogram averaging step.

"Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabeled tracer 2- deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard imaging tool for cancer patient management. The semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) is routinely used in clinical for tumor uptake quantification, which is computed on the static PET image acquired at a certain time (typically 60 min) post tracer injection for a short interval (typically 5-15 min). However, the quantification accuracy of SUV from a single PET scan suffers from the variabilities of tracer plasma clearance and acquisition start time. The dual- time-point FDG PET imaging has been intensively investigated and used in both clinical and research studies, typically one scan at 60 min and the other at 120 min, showing the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET by differentiating malignancy from inflammation and normal tissue. However, the current clinical dual-time-point FDG PET studies use the relative SUV change between two scans as the quantification index, which cannot eliminate the variations in tracer plasma clearance. Meanwhile, the dual-time-point protocol has not been optimized and standardized currently, leading to conflicting results. The fully-quantitative parameter, tracer net uptake rate constant Ki, is the most accurate parameter to quantify FDG PET, which is calculated using dynamic imaging with compartmental modeling. Ki is independent on the plasma clearance or acquisition start time. However, the long and complex acquisition protocol (typically at least 60 min), which requires dynamic scanning and sequential arterial blood sampling (or image-derived blood activity) used as input function from the time of injection, limits its application in clinical practice. Meanwhile, generation of the parametric Ki image, which can provide additional heterogeneity information for FDG PET, is challenging clinically using voxel-by-voxel compartmental modeling due to the computational cost and being sensitive to noise using non-linear least squares. The graphical Patlak plot, can be used for simplified Ki calculation and Ki image generation by voxel-by-voxel fitting. However, it still needs dynamic scanning starting from 15-30 min after injection and input function from the time of injection. The aims of this proposal are 1) to optimize the dual-time-point protocol for accurate Ki quantification using Patlak plot without the need for individual patient's input function, and 2) to generate high-quality low-noise dual-time-point Ki images using novel techniques based on deep learning.

"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for data-driven drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules or cellular features, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. In Phase I of this proposal, we combined the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform. We screened ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes on two cell lines. This dataset was compared to a matching dataset from the pioneering project for D4, the Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. In Phase I, we observed that from both a technical and biological utility standpoint, the metabolomics data provided an orthogonal dataset with signal fidelity, sensitivity, and relevance to compound properties comparable to or exceeding the Connectivity Map. Further, we saw high concordance of plasma metabolite changes in type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis patients with in vitro metabolite changes of related drugs used for those indications. Thus, these results suggest that a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform is not only viable as a complementary dataset to the Connectivity Map, but that metabolomics data can even play a primary role in drug discovery. In this Phase II proposal, we will focus on profiling chemical and genetic perturbations in vitro to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating genetically defined rare diseases. We will expand data generation to ~3300 bioactive compounds across three cell lines. Further, we will profile 50 genetic knockouts on those three cell lines to model in vitro the associated rare diseases. Using Sinopia’s platform, we will select compounds for follow-up evaluation to identify candidates that correct for metabolic dysregulations seen in those rare diseases. Successful in vitro programs will aid in seeding of an early stage discovery pipeline that will be advanced through funding by private investment, patient advocacy groups, and additional federal grants. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we have built a unique platform focused on understanding the use of metabolomics in drug discovery.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,10141255,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates ', ' Aldehyde-Lyases ', ' Aldolases ', ' Amines ', ' amine ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Branched-Chain Amino Acids ', ' branched amino acids ', ' branched chain aminoacid ', ' Amino Alcohols ', ' aminoalcohol ', ' Transaminases ', ' Aminotransferases ', ' Antifungal Agents ', ' Antifungal Drug ', ' Therapeutic Fungicides ', ' anti-fungal ', ' anti-fungal agents ', ' anti-fungal drug ', ' antifungals ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Carbon ', ' chemical synthesis ', ' Dehydration ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Health ', ' Homoserine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Indoles ', ' Industry ', ' Production ', ' Propanolamines ', ' Aminopropanols ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Pyridoxal Phosphate ', ' Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Solvents ', ' Threonine ', ' L-Threonine ', ' Tryptophan Synthase ', ' Tryptophan Synthetase ', ' tryptophan desmolase ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' serine containing aminolipid ', ' Ser-L ', ' serine-containing lipid ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' carboxylate ', ' cofactor ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Active Sites ', ' analog ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Route ', ' interest ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' thermolability ', ' thermostability ', ' condensation ', ' Physical condensation ', ' 2-amino-1,3-propanediol ', ' serinol ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug production ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Address ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' novel lead compound ', ' ']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,291940
"Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis HIV-associated immunosuppression portends high risk for cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Despite progress that has increased HIV testing and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in resource-limited settings, the incidence and mortality of CM remain very high. In addition, ART can elicit immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS), and CM also occurs in HIV- persons, including recipients of solid organ transplants and biologics. There are no host biomarkers to predict which HIV-infected (HIV+) patients will develop CM or C- IRIS. We are interested in the role antibody (Ab) immunity may play in resistance to CM, which is rare in people with intact immunity. We have contributed significant knowledge in this area, including recent data showing lower natural Laminarin (a β-glucan)-binding Ab levels in HIV+ patients with C-IRIS and positive serum cryptococcal antigen tests. Studies of HIV+ and HIV- patients revealed perturbations in Ab repertoires of patients with CM and C-IRIS, and lower IgM memory B cell levels in patients with CM. In mice, IgM memory homologs, B-1 cells and/or naïve IgM enhanced resistance to CM. These cells make Abs that bind microbial carbohydrates, e.g. the β-glucans on the Cn cell wall. The goal of this project is to probe the link between natural Ab and B cell responses to Cn and resistance to CM. We hypothesize CM risk will associate with deficiency of specific Cn- and/or β-glucan-binding Abs, stemming from B cell repertoire pertubations. Our aims are 1] To characterize Cn- and β-glucan-binding Abs of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, isolate monoclonal antibodies (huMabs) from normal persons and test their efficacy in mouse models. 2] To determine the ability of huMabs and GXM- and β-glucan-binding Abs to 1] exert direct effects on Cn viability and biology, and/or 2] mediate human effector cell Cn phagocytosis and/or killing. 3] To analyze B cell subsets, VH/VL repertoires, and transcriptional pathways of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, and controls, and use statistical modeling to identify signatures of CM risk. Knowledge gained from this project will inform tools to predict CM and C-IRIS risk, overcome roadblocks to diagnosis and therapy, provide new insight into the pathogenesis of CM, and inform development of immunotherapy and vaccines. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes a devastating form of meningitis that occurs most commonly in HIV-infected patients with profound T cell deficiency, but also occurs in patients with organ transplants, on biologics, and people with no apparent immune deficiency. Although anti-retroviral therapy has reduced the risk of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in resourced areas, CM continues to ravage HIV-infected patients in Africa, Asia and other areas, even with increased availability of anti-retroviral and anti-fungal therapy. The 6- month survival of CM in resource-limited settings is 45-55%. This is worse than glioblastoma multiforme (66% 2-year survival). At present, there is no way to identify patients who will develop cryptococcosis. The goal of this application is to identify a risk profile to help determine which patients are at risk for CM. This will have a significant impact on prevention, diagnosis, and care of patients with CM and be a major public and global health advance.","Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human

"Harmonizing and Archiving of Large-scale Infant Neuroimaging Data Project Abstract The first postnatal years are an exceptionally dynamic and critical period of structural and functional development of the human brain. Many neurodevelopmental disorders are the consequence of abnormal brain development during this stage. Several NIH-funded studies have recently acquired and released large-scale infant brain MRI datasets in the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA), leading to over 3,000 publically-available infant MRI scans from multiple imaging sites. Joint analysis of these big data of infant brains will undoubtedly improve our limited understanding of normative early brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders with boosted statistical power and reproducibility. However, the processed and harmonized data of these multi-site infant MR images still remain publically absent, due to the challenges in processing and analyzing infant MR images, which typically exhibit extremely low tissue contrast, large within-tissue intensity variations, and regionally-heterogeneous dynamic changes. To address this critical issue, the goal of this project is to comprehensively process, harmonize, discover and archive large-scale, multi-site public infant MRI datasets to significantly advance early brain development studies, by taking advantage of our infant-tailored computational tools and further developing advanced machine learning techniques. In Aim 1, we will extensively process large-scale infant MRI datasets by adopting our established and recently-improved infant- dedicated cortical surface-based computational tools and further develop a deep spherical neural network for quality control of produced cortical property maps. This will lead to quality-ensured vertex-wise maps of multiple biologically-distinct cortical properties, e.g., cortical thickness, surface area, myelin content, sulcal depth, local gyrification, curvature and diffusivity. In Aim 2, to remove site effects associated with different scanners and imaging protocols and meanwhile preserve biological associations, we will harmonize the computed cortical property maps from multi-site data in Aim 1 by leveraging our surface-to-surface cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (S2SGAN) based on the spherical U-Net, without requiring traveling subjects (paired data) across sites. To further increase the efficiency and learn more robust feature representation in the whole multi- site data, we propose to extend S2SGAN to jointly harmonize all multi-site cortical property maps using a single generator. In Aim 3, leveraging the informative growth patterns and gradient information of the harmonized maps of multiple cortical properties in Aim 2, we will discover distinct cortical regions, by capitalizing on multi-view nonnegative matrix factorization in a data-driven manner, without making any assumption on the parametric forms of growth patterns. All our processed data, results, computational tools, and source codes will be deposited into NDA, NITRC, and GitHub to significantly accelerate the pace of early brain development studies. Project Narrative This project aims to comprehensively process, harmonize, discover, and archive large-scale, multi-site public infant neuroimaging data, by taking advantage of our pioneered infant-tailored computational tools and developing advanced machine learning techniques.

"Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots - Summer Undergraduate Support Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots  Emergence of undervaccinated geographical clusters for diseases like measles has become a national concern. A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in recent months, despite high MMR coverage in the United States ( 95%). Such undervaccinated clusters can act as reservoirs of infection that can transmit the disease to a wider population, magnifying their importance far beyond what their absolute numbers might indicate. The existence and growth of such undervaccinated clusters is often known to public health agencies and health provider networks, but they typically do not have enough resources to target people in each such cluster, to attempt to improve the vaccination rate. Preliminary results show that not all undervaccinated clusters are “equal” in terms of their potential for causing a big outbreak (referred to as its “criticality”), and the rate of undervaccination in a cluster does not necessarily correlate with its criticality.  However, there are no existing methods to estimate the potential risk of such clusters, and to identify the most “critical” ones. Some of the key reasons are: (i) purely data-driven spatial statistics methods rely only on immunization coverage, which does not give any indication of the risk of an outbreak; and (ii) current causal epidemic models need to be combined with detailed incidence data, which has not been easily available.  This proposal brings together a systems science approach, combining agent-based stochastic epidemic models, and techniques from machine learning, high performance computing, data mining, and spatial statistics, along with novel public and private datasets on immunization and incidence, to develop a novel methodology for identifying critical clusters, through the following tasks: (i) Identify spatial clusters with signiﬁcantly low immunization rates, or strong anti-vaccine sentiment; (ii) Develop an agent based model for the spread of measles that incorporates detailed immunization data, and is calibrated using a novel source of incidence data; (iii) Develop methods to ﬁnd and characterize critical spatial clusters, with respect to different metrics, which capture both epidemic and economic burden, and order underimmunized clusters based on their criticality; and (iv) Use the methodology to evaluate interventions in terms of their effect on criticality. A highly interdisciplinary team involving two universities, a health care delivery organization and a state department of Health, will work together to develop this methodology.

"Using Common Fund datasets for xenobiotic localization Project Summary Subcellular localization, such as the nucleus lysosomes, and mitochondria, has tremendous potential to enhance the effectiveness of the therapeutic molecules rather than random distribution throughout the cell. With improved subcellular localization and enhanced concentration, a specific molecule can be more efficacious as well as less toxic which is usually a concern of random distribution and nonspecific localization. Therefore, understanding subcellular distribution and the mechanism for a specific molecule can further modulate subcellular dysfunction mediated diseases. Xenobiotic localization at the subcellular level has a profound effect on several processes. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel platform with computational tools for specific xenobiotic localization. The proposed work will take advantage of three common fund datasets. In specific aim-1, we aim to develop a suite of machine learning (ML) models for hierarchical levels of micro-compartmentation and 40 specific subcellular locations. These machine learning models will be first built using three different types of features (fingerprints-based, pharmacophore-based, and physicochemical descriptors-based). Then, they are fused using an advanced multilayer combinatorial fusion algorithm to get the best consensus model. We will also perform the scaffold analysis to identify critical scaffolds that play a role in accumulating molecules at specific subcellular locations. In specific aim-2, we will conduct experimental validation of the predictions developed ML models. More specifically we will test 50 compounds for their subcellular location. In specific aim-3, we plan to build an open portal that incorporates datasets, ML model, prediction server, and documentation. All the data and models generated from the project are made available as open-source. Project Narrative  We propose to develop a novel platform to predict xenobiotic localization at the subcellular level by leveraging and integrating various Common Fund data sets. The successful completion of the proposed research will provide tools for specific drug targeting, lower drug dosages, reduce side effects, de-risking drug development, and improve clinical outcomes.",Using Common Fund datasets for xenobiotic localization,10357502,R03OD032624,"['Algorithms ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Genome ', ' Glyburide ', ' Glibenclamide ', ' Glybenclamide ', ' Micronase ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' Lysosomes ', ' Microtubules ', ' Micro-tubule ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Xenobiotics ', ' Sirolimus ', ' Rapamune ', ' Rapamycin ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Mediating ', ' Paclitaxel ', ' Anzatax ', ' Asotax ', ' Bristaxol ', ' Paclitaxel (Taxol) ', ' Praxel ', ' Taxol ', ' Taxol A ', ' Taxol Konzentrat ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Failure ', ' Multi-Drug Resistance ', ' Multidrug Resistance ', ' Multiple Drug Resistance ', ' Multiple Drug Resistant ', ' Resistance to Multi-drug ', ' Resistance to Multidrug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistant to multi-drug ', ' Resistant to multidrug ', ' multi-drug resistant ', ' multidrug resistant ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Descriptor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' success ', ' pharmacophore ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' Documentation ', ' drug discovery ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Validation ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Process ', ' neglect ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' combinatorial ', ' therapeutic effectiveness ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tool development ', ' drug candidate ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' side effect ', ' drug disposition ', ' refractory cancer ', ' resistant cancer ', ' ']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R03,2021,304000
"Diabetic Retinopathy: Genetics and Neurodegeneration (MSN246458) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of vision loss among working aged adults. Its prevalence is increasing and despite the strides in knowledge and treatments, our understanding of the pathways leading to vision loss in DM remains limited. Hyperglycemia and duration of DM contribute to but do not fully explain the predisposition to develop diabetic retinal diseases. Given the predisposition for diabetic retinal diseases to cluster in families, genetic risk factors are thought to be important but none has so far been definitively implicated. Furthermore, data from small studies suggest that there are more phenotypes of diabetic retinal disease than are currently recognized in clinical practice. Diabetic retinal disease has traditionally been considered primarily a vascular process: diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are the main clinical manifestations. With improved imaging modalities and image analysis algorithms, there has been increasing recognition of a new clinical manifestation of diabetic retinal disease, diabetic retinal neurodegeneration (DRN). This is visible as alterations in thickness of retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) and/or ganglion cell layer (GCL) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. To date, DRN is poorly understood, and its role in clinical management of patients with DM has not been established. However, if retinal neurodegeneration occurs and is progressive, it can lead to profound visual difficulties for patients with DM. DRN may account for previously unexplained poor visual outcomes among patients with diabetic retinal disease despite standard of care treatment. Dr. Channa is a retina specialist, with prior research experience in retinal imaging and clinical trials of novel treatments for DME. In this K23 career development award she proposes to use a nationally representative dataset, the UK Biobank cohort to: 1) improve our understanding of DRN by determining RNFL and GCL thickness, using OCT imaging, in participants with DM (who have no DR or DME) compared to those who do not have DM 2) determine genetic factors associated with DR, DME and DRN. Dr. Channa proposes a career development plan, which includes mentorship, coursework, publications and clinical time. This will situate her as an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing bioinformatics and computational skills in genomics and retinal image analysis to elucidate pathways of vision loss among patients with DM, ultimately leading to development of novel therapies. Her research work and career development will take place in the academic and collaborative environment of the largest medical center in the world, where she has institutional support and mentorship to develop as an independent clinician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this career development award we aim to use genetic and retinal imaging data to enhance our understanding of the pathways that can lead to vision loss among people with diabetic retinal diseases. Improved understanding will translate into interventions aimed at preventing blindness from diabetes.",Diabetic Retinopathy: Genetics and Neurodegeneration (MSN246458),10320692,K23EY030911,"['Adult ',

"Development of A High Throughput Image-Guided IMRT System for Preclinical Research Project Summary/Abstract Preclinical radiobiology experiments on small animals are crucial to test the safety and efficacy before human clinical trials. However, limited by currently available technologies, preclinical animal studies substantially differ from state-of-the-art human treatments in dose conformity. Consequently, the animal studies poorly mimic the radiobiological, radioimmunological, and toxicity environment of human therapies. The disparity adversely affects our ability to meaningfully test hypotheses that are intended for human translation. With decades of advancement, human radiotherapy has achieved high targeting accuracy and dose conformality based on technological breakthroughs, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), which is unavailable for mouse experiments. A practical device and algorithm to modulate the x-ray intensity for the scale of small animals is the first step to bridge the gap. With the support of an NIH R21 grant, we engineered a novel small animal IMRT dose modulator termed sparse orthogonal collimator (SOC). Equally important as the hardware, we created the enabling mathematical tools to deliver SOC IMRT plans with higher achievable resolution than a theoretically miniaturized MLC-based IMRT. We commissioned and tested prototypical SOCs to deliver highly modulated doses in silico and on phantoms. Nonetheless, there are still large gaps between an intensity modulation device and a small animal IMRT system suitable for broad adoption and impact. The required time, resources, and training to create sophisticated SOC-IMRT plans are incompatible with preclinical settings. Furthermore, without automation, the existing image-guided small animal IMRT treatment is prohibitively slow for treating live animals under anesthesia. Lastly, the current manual method to switch between imaging and therapy modes results in intractable uncertainties in dose delivery. We propose to fill these gaps using automation, robotics, and system optimization. We propose the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1 (SA1). Automated organ segmentation for mice using deep learning neural networks. Specific Aim 2 (SA2). Development of a fully functional, automated, and efficient IMRT system. Specific Aim 3 (SA3). Development and validation of a robotic Multi Mouse Automated Treatment Environment (Multi-MATE) for automated imaging and treatment. Besides dosimetry, we will quantify the time performance, which is critical to small animal IMRT system. As a result, in addition to improving the hardware accuracy and reliability, the proposed project will provide a fully automated planning and delivery system, thus removing the last barriers towards the broad adoption of small animal IMRT. The success of the proposed project will help existing research to achieve the full potential for human translation and enable future hypotheses testing where accurate complex dose distribution is critical. Project Narrative A major impediment in translating animal radiation studies to human patients is the disparity in radiation techniques. Existing methods cannot create human like conformal radiation dose on mice with necessary accuracy and efficiency. To better mimic human treatment without prohibitively complicated and slow procedures, we propose to develop a high throughput image guided small animal conformal irradiation platform.",Development of A High Throughput Image-Guided IMRT System for Preclinical Research,10317441,R01CA259008,"['Radiation ', ' miniaturize ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' irradiation ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' IMRT ', ' Intensity Modulated RT ', ' Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ', ' Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' biological research ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' user-friendly ', ' tumor ', ' safety testing ', ' process optimization ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' robotic system ', ' in silico ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Animals ', ' Automation ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Manuals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Radiobiology ', ' Radiation Biology ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Robotics ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' TimeLine ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Collimation ', ' Collimator ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' dosimetry ', ' 3-D CRT ', ' 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy ', ' 3-dimensional conformal ablation ', ' 3D-CRT ', ' Conformal Therapy ', ' Radiation Conformal Therapy ', ' conformal radiation ', ' conformal radiation therapy ', ' Conformal Radiotherapy ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,441662
"Endoscope development for the clinical use of near infrared fluorescence molecular probes in the GI tract Minimally-invasive optical imaging is being advanced by molecular probes that enhance contrast using fluorescence. The applications in cancer imaging are very broad, ranging from early diagnosis of cancer to the guiding of interventions, such as biopsy. The high-sensitivity afforded by wide-field fluorescence imaging using scanning laser light is being developed for these broad applications. The platform technology is the SFE – Scanning Fiber Endoscope, which places a sub-1-mm scanner at the tip of a highly flexible shaft. Because several different laser wavelengths can be mixed and scanned together, full-color reflectance imaging will be combined with near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging in a 4-channel multimodal SFE. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype VerAvanti 4-channel multimodal SFE (mmSFE) for a specific cancer imaging application that can have significant impact in early detection and endoscopic treatment of esophageal cancer. VerAvanti is a start-up company located in Redmond, Washington and is founded and staffed with engineering graduates from the University of Washington (UW), where the SFE was invented and tested in pilot clinical trials. VerAvanti has exclusive license to commercialize the SFE technology for medical imaging and a 3- channel full color SFE (using red, green, and blue reflectance) is already in pilot manufacturing and testing. This project will rapidly translate the 4-channel mmSFE technology into a specific product for fluorescently guiding endoscopic interventions in the GI tract. Furthermore, the VerAvanti mmSFE will be designed for efficient manufacturing in a modular format with reduced part numbers and expected lower cost. The application is using NIR fluorescence molecular probes that were developed at the University of Michigan (UM) that bind to high grade dysplasia (HGD) and neoplastic cells of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The mmSFE product is introduced through the working channel of a conventional endoscope to identify regions of the lower esophagus that are over-expressing EGFR and ErbB2, which are transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors that stimulate epithelial cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Overexpression of these targets reflects an increase in biological aggressiveness and higher risk for progression to Barrett's esophagus, HGD, and EAC. The design of the mmSFE diagnostic algorithm is based on the high correlation of the fluorescence lesion target-to-background measurement in collaboration with UW and UM. Additional mmSFE guided tools will be developed for more accurate endoscopic interventions using NIR fluorescence molecular probes. Both software and hardware will be fabricated and tested for the start of a multisite clinical trial using the mmSFE. The multimodal scanning fiber endoscope (mmSFE) technology was developed by the University of Washington, licensed to VerAvanti Inc., and now demonstrates feasibility for detecting early cancer of the esophagus in clinical testing at the University of Michigan using fluorescence molecular markers that bind to cancer cells. In this direct phase 2 SBIR project, VerAvanti will improve the fluorescence imaging performance of the prototype mmSFE system, support advanced imaging processing at the University of Washington, and design new interventional devices that provide direct visualization from an integrated mmSFE. The result of this project will be to provide a novel endoscope product to the University of Michigan and national leaders in the management of esophageal cancer for a future multisite clinical trial.",Endoscope development for the clinical use of near infrared fluorescence molecular probes in the GI tract,10325563,R44CA261318,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture

"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding. NARRATIVE Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in a number of secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness. A reversible glucose responsive insulin (GRI) would represent a significant improvement in diabetes care for both T1D and T2D patients. The success of this project will result in clinical candidates that will ultimately supplant basal and prandial insulins while simultaneously improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic

"Proteomic Analysis of Blood Plasma using High Throughput Sequencers Abstract  Aptamers made from DNA, RNA and other nucleic acids that have chemical modifications can be engineered to bind tightly to biomolecules like the proteins that circulate in blood.  The primary goal of this project is to develop a kit of aptamer reagents to enable simultaneous measurement of protein abundance profiles, focusing especially on significant differentially abundant proteins in blood. This will aid in cancer diagnostics and in monitoring protein populations over the course of disease and therapeutic intervention. The intended product is an Aptamer Proteomics kit (AP-kit) that can be used by researchers and clinicians to comprehensively profile the differences between healthy individuals and those afflicted with cancer. The kits will be validated in-house and tested with carefully curated samples focused on prostate cancer.  The AP-kits will give cancer scientists new tools that lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of cancer types and to create new and more effective treatments and preventions. Physicians will be enabled to diagnose tumors earlier, reducing the burden of radiation treatments and chemotherapy on cancer patients. AP-assays will aid in monitoring the progress of cancer therapies and allow treatments to be customized for individual patients. These outcomes will increase quality of life and substantially decrease the burden of cancer on society. Narrative  This project aims to provide kits for research scientists and clinicians to make comprehensive surveys of the identities and levels of proteins in blood. The outcome will be a rapid clinical test to distinguish differences in the profiles of proteins from healthy human subjects and those who have cancer.",Proteomic Analysis of Blood Plasma using High

"The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities Very little is known about the impact of locally-mandated COVID-19 mitigation policies such as Non- Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) on the health and wellbeing of medically and economically vulnerable populations such as American Indians (AI) living in rural tribal lands. There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of already implemented measures on the spread of COVID-19, the social and economic impact of those measures in these communities, and the potential spillover effects on non-AIAN communities. The staggered nature of the NPI implementation in tribal lands and the independence of sovereign nations’ policy decisions from local (e.g. county-level) policies present a unique quasi-natural experiment in policy timing, allowing us to study spillover effects from tribal NPIs to connected non-tribal areas. Our research efforts seek to improve American Indian health by understanding and evaluating these NPI measures on an NIH-designated disparity community. This R01 proposal has four specific aims: (1) Identify whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to the early closure of American Indian reservations and/or tribal casinos among Native and non-Native populations living on and off of adjacent reservation lands. (2) Identify the change in commuter patterns and movement behaviors as a result of NPIs. (3) Use in-time claims data to analyze how the implementation of NPIs and the progression of the epidemic affected utilization of different non-COVID-19 health care services and facilities. (4) Conduct a survey of American Indians living in rural areas to create a new primary data resource and cross-validate the results we obtain through analysis of secondary data of cell phone traffic flows. The long- term goal of this proposal is to develop and validate analytical tools that could be applied with large secondary datasets to aid the evaluation and design of public policies to address public health emergencies in AI populations. Our central hypothesis is that the timely implementation of tribal NPIs reduced the incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in AI communities and in traffic-connected areas. However, we also expect that the secondary effects of NPIs, such as economic hardship and under-utilization of non-COVID-related health care, would be stronger on tribal lands. We will use an innovative two-pronged approach to combine empirical analysis of secondary big data sources with primary data collection to provide robust evidence on the current and future effects of these policies. This proposal is significant because the impact of COVID-19 and related policies on tribal communities is under-researched, under-funded, and not well understood, and yet relevant not only for AI tribal policies and populations but for regional health and economic policies. Our research is guided by the C.A.R.E. Principles of Indigenous Data Governance developed by our team members. It is innovative because it applies techniques from economics, computer science and public health to deliver actionable results and recommendations for future policy implementation. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies have been shown to disparately impact socially vulnerable and under-served minority groups in the US. This proposed study develops an innovative approach to analyzing the effects of COVID-19 mitigation policies on American Indian populations living on tribal lands and in rural areas, by integrating big data and deep learning techniques with primary data collection.

"Systems Biology of Shape and Size Regulation Abstract The molecular regulation of body shape and size during development and regeneration involves numerous pathways precisely integrated together with the biophysical properties of cellular and tissue dynamics, a complex process poorly understood at the level of whole animals. The overall goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the genetic regulation and coordination of large-scale tissue growth by developing and applying a novel integrated systems biology approach. Combining in vivo experiments and their morphological formalization with machine learning of mathematical biophysical models, we will discern the molecular mechanisms that control growth, shape, and size regulation. We will leverage the robustness of the planarian worm to address the molecular and physical mechanisms regulating their extraordinary homeostatic and regenerative capacity to grow, degrow, and regenerate their whole-body shapes and organs from almost any amputation and across one order of magnitude in sizes. This work will develop novel computational systems biology methods and integrate them with whole-body gene expression imaging and surgical and genetic manipulations assays to elucidate the molecular regulators of body shape and size. Morphological, genetic, and surgical data will be formalized with novel mathematical ontologies, which will serve as input to new machine learning methods able to infer mechanistic gene regulatory networks. The regulatory networks will be quantitatively modeled with a novel mathematical continuous approach for whole-body biophysical simulation, including tissue growth, adhesion molecules, and gene regulation. This computational framework combining machine learning with biophysical modeling will be able to discover the mechanisms of growth and shape regulation from large formalized experimental datasets. Novel genetic interactions will be discovered by the machine learning methodology, which predictions in terms of morphological and gene expression outcomes resulting from genetic and surgical manipulations will be validated at the bench via RNAi and in situ hybridization assays. Integrating machine learning, biophysical mathematical modeling, ontological formalizations, and in vivo surgical and molecular assays represents a comprehensive systems biology approach for elucidating the regulation of shape and size. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of the diverse genetic pathways that regulate tissue growth dynamics and how they interact precisely between them and with tissue biophysics to create and maintain whole-body scale targeted shapes and sizes. This work will pave the way for new applications and novel therapies in human developmental, regenerative, and cancer medicine. Project Narrative The genetic regulation of the shape and size of internal organs and whole body is crucial during development, regeneration, and homeostasis. This project will develop a novel integrated systems biology approach to elucidate mechanistically the molecular pathways and their coordination that control large-scale tissue growth dynamics in living organisms.

"Multiscale theory of synapse function with model reduction by machine learning Project Summary/Abstract  This project constructs a unifying model that links synaptic morphodynamics, the fundamental process of learning and memory in the brain, to the underlying molecular signaling pathways that regulate it. The motivation for this work is a new class of machine learning methods for multiscale modeling that are a promising candidate for linking the disparate spatial and temporal scales involved, from s calcium events in nano-domains to actin reorganization on the order of minutes across a dendritic spine head. Previously, it has only been possible to study each of these scales in isolation. The project brings together experts in (1) modeling the biochemistry at synapses, (2) modeling the growth of the actin cytoskeleton, and (3) developing the theory and algorithms of multiscale modeling with machine learning. The result of this collaboration will be a milestone model in cellular neuroscience that mechanistically connects calcium signaling in dendritic spines to the growth of the actin cytoskeleton in spine remodeling. Currently, there are few models that can e ectively make predictions about actin structure formation based on changes in calcium in ux into the post-synaptic spine. Since the new data-driven models will be more computationally ecient than exact simulations, it will also be possible to incorporate them into coarse-scale models of synapses used in network simulations and in neuroengineering applications. Additionally, the methods developed in this work an important contribution to modeling in cellular neuroscience, particularly because they are data-driven and therefore widely applicable. Finally, the development of a suite of software tools for multiscale modeling with machine learning will catalyze future collaborations and scienti c developments in the neuroscience community, particularly using models that aim to connect cellular phenomena with mechanisms at sub-second resolution. Such models can potentially bene t the development of pharmaceutical targets for learning de cits associated with aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. Project Narrative  The changing shape and size of synapses - synaptic morphodynamics - is the essential process of learning and memory in the brain, but is not well understood because of the wide range of spatial and temporal scales involved. This project mechanistically links the molecular signaling pathways in synapses to the growth of the actin cytoskeleton using a new class of machine learning methods for multiscale modeling.

"iPAT:Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis for Harmonized MA-National Trials PROJECT SUMMARY A decade ago, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended dietary pattern approaches to examine relationships between diet and health outcomes. Meanwhile, longitudinal dietary data have become increasingly available. However, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing dynamic diet-quality variations and remain rudimentary for validating longitudinal diet-quality patterns, thus, leading to unclear evidence for assessing diet-health relationships and formulating dietary guidelines. A noticeable gap exists between the dietary pattern literature and the fast-growing statistical learning field with explosive growth of artificial intelligence algorithms. We propose to develop “iPAT:Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis for Harmonized MA-National Trials”. iPAT will leverage original and newly harmonized dietary data generated from 7 studies funded by NIDDK, NHLBI, and NIMH: 4 longitudinal randomized controlled trials (RCT) in Massachusetts (MA), and 3 large-scale longitudinal multi-site national studies, an RCT and one observational study (OS) from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), and one OS from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. We aim to harness over 20 newly-harmonized dietary datasets from these highly-comparable longitudinal studies that span up to 35 years and cross 50 clinical and health community centers to: 1) innovate by adapting our new visualization-aided trajectory pattern-recognition and validation algorithm to an intelligent and streamlined pattern analysis tool (iPAT) for longitudinal dietary data; 2) enable a new multi-view and comprehensive understanding of diet-quality trajectory patterns for multiple chronic disease outcomes that may not be discoverable from individual studies at different levels of granularity; and 3) create an accessible and expandable harmonized dietary database and open-access iPAT tool for diet-related studies. Our harmonized-data-driven approach will increase the likelihood of successfully addressing complex and subtle questions with large-scale dietary data, including but not limited to the cultural, age, gender and geographic variation in diet quality patterns and how diet quality may vary with context and time. Our iPAT approach will be built upon PI Fang’s behavioral trajectory pattern-recognition method which has been validated and replicated in five NIDA/NCI/NHLBI-funded longitudinal OS and RCTs. Developing this evidence- based iPAT tool will contribute to the infrastructure for diet-related studies, advance pattern-recognition methods, help scientific communities and the public to compare individual dietary behavior with local and national diet- quality patterns and associated dietary health risks. Our work will also help grow more valid evidence for dietary guidelines. More broadly, this iPAT project will contribute to creating a platform that supports harmonized data management, near-real-time pattern analyses and adaptive interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Understanding human food intake behavior and related health risks is critical for important societal goals such as preventing or managing many chronic conditions, promoting well-being and safety, and improving life-long health learning. Harnessing a number of harmonized dietary data from highly-comparable local and national trials, our innovative Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis (iPAT) tool will provide a more robust identification and visualization of diet-quality patterns and clarify our understanding of diet-disease relationships for a range of people over time and across geographic regions. Our work will help grow more valid evidence for formulating dietary guidelines and may enable better personalized, adaptive dietary strategies.",iPAT:Intelligent Diet Quality Pattern Analysis for Harmonized MA-National Trials,10276034,R01DK129432,"['Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' data management ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Nutrient ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' response ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ', ' social media ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Longitudinal observational study ', ' Longitudinal observation study ', ' dietary guidelines ', ' Infrastructure ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' statistical learning ', ' Visualization ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' dietary ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH,R01,2021,748446

However, the current in-depth research and achievements are mainly concentrated on several driver NGs, and classical cancer drugs have been directly used to target the NG domains, such as the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 fusion protein in leukemia. Some of the fusion proteins with retaining DNA-binding domains such as transcription factors can directly bind their target genes, such as the EWSR1-FLI fusion actively recruiting BAF complex. Recently, the downstream effectors of driver FGs have emerged as therapeutic targets. For example, targeting the downstream CCND2 inhibited RUNX1/ETO-driven leukemic expansion in vitro and in vivo and inhibition of STAT5, the downstream factor of NUP214-ABL1 led to the induction of leukemia cell death. However, the functions of most identified FGs have not been systematically investigated. This is mainly due to the limitations of traditional tools and the high cost of experimental procedures. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new tools for analyzing NG breakpoint-specific features systemically in the human genome and predict their originating and regulatory mechanisms, such as upstream and downstream effectors. In-depth annotation based on NG structure is important for understanding the cellular mechanisms of NGs. Effective use of systematic bioinformatics tools for functional annotation can provide a deeper insight into the role of NGs in the development and progression of diseases such as cancers to find direct and indirect therapeutic targets. In this study, we will develop five bioinformatics tools for the functional annotation and feature analysis of NGs, a predictive pipeline for automatic analysis of downstream effects of NGs, and a predictive method for tracing the origin of NGs. This project will be a substantial contribution to public health by systematicallydeep annotating thefunction of new genes (NGs) in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. These systematic annotation results will be performed through ChimerAnno (a tool for functional annotation of human chimeric genes), FGviewer (a tool for visualizing multi-tiered functional features of fusion genes), NGeffector with DeepChIP (a tool for predicting NG downstream effectors with enhanced transcription factor binding site prediction with deep learning), DeepCLIP (a tool for providing evidence of origin of NGs for trans-splicing mechanism) and hBPAI (a tool for feature extraction of human new genes' breakpoint (BP)). The application of these approaches on all kinds of human BPs of new genes will be integrated into NewGeneDB, New Gene annotation Database. This study will advance our knowledge in NG regulatory mechanisms in diseases and open up the possibility of novel treatments of cancer tools and platforms for analyzing NGs. and other diseases in the future by providing powerful",Functional annotation of new genes aided by deep learning,10241506,R35GM138184,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' leukemia ', ' Methods ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Chimeric Proteins ', ' Chimera Protein ', ' Fusion Protein ', ' base ', ' fusion gene ', ' Procedures ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Disease Progression ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' chimeric gene ', ' Trans RNA Splicing ', ' Trans-Splicing ', ' novel ', ' EWSR1 ', ' Ewing Sarcoma Breakpoint Region 1 ', ' EWSR1 gene ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' MGF protein ', ' MGSNF protein ', ' STAT5 ', ' STAT5A ', ' STAT5A gene ', ' STAT5a Transcription Factor ', ' Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5A ', ' Stat5a protein ', ' Stat5alpha protein ', ' mammary gland factor ', ' mammary gland-specific nuclear factor ', ' signal tranducer and activator of transcription 5 ', ' Stat5 protein ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' CAIN Gene ', ' CAN Protein ', ' CAN gene ', ' D9S46E ', ' KIAA0023 ', ' NUP214 ', ' Nucleoporin 214kDa ', ' Nucleoporin, 214-KD ', ' NUP214 gene ', ' AML1 ', ' AMLCR1 ', ' CBFA2 ', ' PEBP2A2 ', ' PEBP2aB ', ' RUNX1 ', ' RUNX1 gene ', ' ABL1 ', ' Abelson Murine Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 1 ', ' JTK7 ', ' c-Abl ', ' c-abl Genes ', ' c-abl Proto-Oncogenes ', ' ABL1 gene ', ' CCND2 ', ' KIAK0002 ', ' cyclin D2 ', ' CCND2 gene ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' in vivo ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' genes structure ', ' Leukemic Cell ', ' Transcript ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' predictive tools ', ' deep learning ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' feature extraction ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R35,2021,323658
"Linking genetics to cellular behavior and disease via multimodal data integration Project Summary / Abstract Studies of mechanisms underlying genetic associations with disease have primarily focused on gene regulatory mechanisms. In contrast, the impact of genetic variation on cellular phenotypes such as morphology and behavior is poorly understood, despite their importance in disease progression. This poor understanding is in part because measurement of some cellular phenotypes such as electrophysiological response patterns require skilled manual labor and is performed cell by cell, and is thus low throughput. Furthermore, some cellular phenotype assays require live cells, which for cell types such as neurons are prohibitively challenging to obtain from humans. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning-based frameworks for characterizing how molecular and cellular phenotypes covary using multimodal datasets, then to predict how these cellular behaviors mediate the effect of genetic variation on the risk of illnesses such as psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. We will achieve this overall goal through the development of three frameworks. Multimodal models linking molecular and cellular phenotypes of cells. By linking gene regulation with cellular phenotypes such as neuron electrophysiology and morphology, we can then understand how changes at the molecular level propagate to cellular phenotypes and vice versa. Furthermore, we can use these models to impute cellular phenotypes when they cannot be measured experimentally. Identification of cellular phenotypes that mediate genetic risk of mental disorders. We will jointly model genotype, gene expression, cellular phenotypes and disease risk to generate mechanistic hypotheses about the mediation of genetic effects on disease risk through cellular phenotypes. Prediction of cellular phenotypes associated with disease progression. We will develop a prediction framework for exploring which cellular phenotypes change significantly with disease progression. By applying our imputation framework developed above, we will predict changes in neuron electrophysiological response and morphology associated with a range of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. We expect completion of this project to yield generalizable computational frameworks for linking genetics to molecular and cellular phenotypes for diverse cell types and organs. Project Narrative A large number of gene mutations that are associated with disease risk have been identified for diverse diseases. Hypotheses about how these mutations confer disease risk and their effects on cells and tissues are needed in order to prioritize therapeutic targets for intervention. This study proposes computational frameworks for identifying gene mutations that affect cellular behaviors of individual human cells, therefore enabling prioritization of therapeutic targets.",Linking genetics to cellular behavior and disease via multimodal data integration,10246113,DP2MH129987,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Manuals ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phenotype ', ' Risk ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' genetic association ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' data integration ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' therapeutic target ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' deep learning ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,DP2,2021,1431500
"Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings Project Summary: Darwin Babino, PhD, a trained pharmacologist/electrophysiologist, has spent the last ten years working on several disciplines in the vision sciences. His proposal entitled “Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings” presents his overarching goal to improve vision restoration approaches by developing methods to test the potential of these techniques thereby accelerating the development of effective interventions. Dr. Babino and his primary mentor, Dr. Russell Van Gelder, have assembled a strong team of co-mentors at the University of Washington SOM and collaborators to guide him through the proposed training and research. His previous training will be supplemented with goals to help his development as an independent investigator: 1) Study design and practical learning in performing panretinal (MEA) biological experiments; 2) Fundamental and advanced techniques of the proposed optogenetic and stem-cell restoration techniques; 3) Application of advanced machine learning techniques; 4) Develop leadership and professional skills to establish an independent group. The ability to assess the function of panretinal circuitry will foster our understanding of the advantages and weaknesses of different restoration techniques (Aim 1). The work proposed here will improve an existing retinal acuity assessment tool which combines machine learning techniques on novel, high-density multielectrode array recordings of ganglion cell responses in several mouse models. The utility of this system will be demonstrated in assessing visual potential of the mouse retina in three different approaches to vision restoration that are challenging for in vivo assessment (Aim 2). In collaboration with Dr. Deepak A. Lamba at UCSF, we will apply our system to animals which have undergone stem-cell replacement of retinal cells including photoreceptor cells. An optogenetics approach will also be evaluated in collaboration with Dr. John Flannery at UC Berkeley whose group has developed vectors for expressing rhodopsin and cone opsins in ganglion and bipolar cells. Finally, differences between native and restored vison with small molecule photoswitches, light-activated inhibitors of voltage-gated potassium channels, which confer light-dependent firing on treated cells, will be assessed. The resulting advanced electrophysiology application will help elucidate fundamental questions about the functional retina, mechanisms that lead to retinal degeneration and the potential of several therapeutics for the treatment of retinal diseases. Furthermore, this career development award will facilitate Dr. Babino’s development into an independent investigator by priming an R01 grant application. Project Narrative: Project Narrative: The prevalence of vision loss from retinal degeneration numbers in the millions world-wide and is expected to double by the year 2050, and despite the development of several promising approaches to restore vision in the blind, progress in developing these therapies has been hampered by challenges in analysis of these methods in animal models. We describe a novel system that analyzes, by machine learning, retinal ganglion cell output in native, degenerated and therapeutically treated blind retinas which can characterize the visual information content of the ‘reanimated’ blind retina and thereby facilitate the development of these technologies. The system developed through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to the assessment of potential retinal acuity restoration by current and novel therapeutic approaches.",Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings,10244896,K99EY031333,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', '

"SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING EMAN is one of the most well-established and widely used scientific image processing suites targeting the rapidly growing CryoEM/CryoET community worldwide. In turn, the CryoEM and CryoET studies which it enables permit determination of the structures of interacting macromolecules both in-vitro and in-vivo, and are being used to better understand the biochemical processes taking place in cells, to better identify potential drug targets and develop novel diagnostics. With the higher resolutions now possible in this field, direct drug interaction structural studies are now possible, and being used to gain insight into the mode of action of drugs within the cell. Unlike many newer tools in the field, such as Relion, CisTEM and CryoSparc, which focus on specific refinement tasks, EMAN is a versatile, modular suite capable of performing a variety of image processing tasks with hundreds of algorithms supporting virtually all of the standard file formats and mathematical conventions used in the field, as well as other related imaging fields. It provides an ideal platform for prototyping fundamental new algorithm developments, while still able to achieve data-limited resolution in single particle reconstruction. While high resolution single particle refinement has become routine in recent years, thanks largely to the dramatic data quality improvements provided by new detector technology, there remain significant opportunities for improvements in mitigating model bias, efficient use of data, and analysis of complexes with compositional or conformational variability. Some of the most important problems from a biological perspective involve the sort of compositional and conformational variability which remain challenging problems. The field also remains susceptible to problems of initial model bias, which are exacerbated in systems exhibiting structural variability, and as a result many structures are still published with exaggerated resolution claims. The standard protocols used by many in the field typically involve discarding a very large fraction of the raw data (as much as 80-90% in some cases), often based on qualitative assessments, raising questions related to rigor and reproducibility of structural results. In this proposal, we will develop or adapt image processing techniques to help resolve these issues, based on developments or unrealized concepts from mathematics and computer science. CryoEM and CryoET are used to study the structures of interacting biomolecules in the cell at resolutions 100x better than the best possible light microscope. This methodology permits new insights into the biomolecules which underlie disease, can shed light on structural changes in diseased cells and provide direct information on how drugs interact with the molecules they target.

"Epidemiology of Biomarkers of AMD Progression Project Abstract There are currently no effective treatments for atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in part because we may be intervening too late in the disease course after geographic atrophy (GA) has developed. A far preferable strategy would be to intervene at an earlier phase of the disease, but there is uncertainty with regards to disease biomarkers to select the most appropriate patients as well as endpoints which could be used to conduct an interventional trial in a clinically-practical time-frame. This is in large part because of the lack of a sufficiently granular staging system describing the progression from early to late stage AMD. The best currently available data comes from studies such as the Age-Related Eye Diseases Study and the Beaver Dam Eye Study, but these studies were largely based on color fundus photographs with AMD disease features assessed using historical protocols developed in the film-based imaging era. The AMD disease severity scales and staging systems built from these studies are insufficiently granular and fail to take advantage of modern, pervasive digital imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCT-A) which readily lend themselves to quantification. Extensive research over the past decade has identified a number of structural OCT features of AMD, such as intraretinal hyper-reflective foci and subretinal drusenoid deposits, which appear to increase the risk for developing late AMD (atrophy and/or neovascularization). More recently, choriocapillaris (CC) flow deficits have been shown to increase with age and in AMD. The relationship between CC flow deficits and the onset and stage of AMD still remains to be defined. In addition, although a number of genetic risk factors for AMD have been identified, the genetics of AMD progression are not yet elucidated. This research application proposes to address these critical knowledge gaps by evaluating elderly subjects with AMD who have previously been recruited as part of the NEI-funded Amish Eye Study. The Amish represent a homogenous population with regards to environmental and social exposures which reduces variability and makes this group ideally suited for epidemiologic studies of AMD progression. Through that previous study, baseline (and some 2-year follow up) clinical, multimodal imaging (including OCT), and genetic data have already been collected. However, long-term (7 year) data, which will be a focus of our proposed research, is critical to actually establish which individuals go on to progress to late AMD, which is vital in order to determine which baseline features are associated with a higher risk of progression, and to develop a granular and quantitative staging system for AMD. The development of this novel AMD staging system will provide points of intervention and outcome assessment to enable early intervention clinical trials and provide new insights into the genetics and pathophysiology of AMD. Project Narrative Despite effective treatments for choroidal neovascularization, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remains the leading cause of blindness in the US due to the eventual development of atrophy in the long-term. As current attempts to develop therapies to slow the progression of atrophy have met with limited success, earlier intervention would be desirable, and could be possible if endpoints and biomarkers to assess progression early in the disease were available. By studying the epidemiology of AMD progression over 7 years, the proposed research will identify these critical biomarkers and develop a staging system for AMD which is essential to enable early intervention clinical trials for AMD.",Epidemiology of Biomarkers of AMD Progression,10233694,R01EY030614,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', '

"Connectome-Based Prediction of Addiction Severity 7. Abstract The United States is currently facing an epidemic of fatalities associated with the use of multiple types of substances. Given this public health crisis, there is an urgent need to identify transdiagnostic, dimensional biomarkers of substance use disorders (SUDs). In the field of clinical neuroscience, traditional, group-level functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approaches have struggled to identify predictive biomarkers of addiction that replicate across samples, possibly due to methods that (a) overfit the data and (b) examine different SUDs in isolation. To address this, the first objective of this application is to leverage recent advances in connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), a data-driven machine-learning approach, to identify patterns of functional connectivity (“neural fingerprints”) that are predictive of a transdiagnostic, dimensional measure of SUD severity at the individual level. Further, as opposed to single-modality research, NIDA has outlined the need to examine the complex interactions of factors across biological, psychological, and environmental domains (Priority Focus #1) in order to understand the real-word complexity of SUD vulnerability (Priority Focus #3). In line with these priorities, the second objective of this application is to integrate SUD-related whole-brain metrics into multilevel models of addiction vulnerability that include well-established psychological and environmental risk factors. The proposed research will make use of archival data collected as part of two independent studies (N = 242). Clinical assessments, self-report data, and resting-state fMRI data were collected from a diverse sample of community adults, elevated on illicit drug use, with 43% meeting criteria for a lifetime SUD and 81% reporting a history of illicit drug use. We hypothesize that a CPM-derived neural network will emerge in relation to SUD severity in the training sample that can be used to accurately predict SUD severity in another independent sample (Aim #1). This is expected to produce a working neural model that can be further tested and applied to make highly-individualized predictions of SUD severity in other, unseen samples. Next, we hypothesize that these networks will contribute unique variance to a multi-faceted model of addiction vulnerability, above and beyond well-established psychological and environmental risk factors (Aim #2). The integration of knowledge across multiple domains makes this application well-situated to address the real-world complexity of SUDs, and thus presents an opportunity for significant advances towards the development of precision medicine methods. This F31 application will provide opportunities for the applicant’s training in two critical areas: (a) the technical skills necessary to implement machine learning approaches to isolate brain networks with predictive power to identify individual differences in SUD severity and (b) the conceptualization and design of multi-faceted models that incorporate factors from multiple domains of analysis to characterize addiction vulnerability. 8. Project Narrative Although extant human neuroimaging research has identified a number of aberrant brain networks associated with addiction, it has struggled to produce reliable predictive biomarkers of substance use disorders (SUDs). To address this, the objective of this application is to leverage recent advances in connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to identify functional neural networks that are predictive of SUD severity at the individual level, and to test the relative contribution of these novel neural metrics in integrated models of latent addiction vulnerability. The proposed training and research plans are intended to advance understanding of the multidimensional nature of addiction and further develop the applicants’ program of research that seeks to elucidate the biopsychosocial processes underlying addiction.",Connectome-Based Prediction of Addiction Severity,10232857,F31DA053782,"['Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Equation ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' multidrug use ', ' poly drug use ', ' polydrug use ', ' multiple drug use ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' neural model ', ' Affective ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' network models ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' individualized prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' connectome ', ' illicit drug use ', ' knowledge integration ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' biomarker performance ', ' biomarker utility ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' stimulant use ', ' neural network ', ' connectome based predictive modeling ', ' connectome data ', ' connectomic data ', ' archive data ', ' archiving data ', ' archived data ', ' polysubstance use ', ' multiple substance use ', ' multisubstance use ', ' poly substance use ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,F31,2021,46036
"Finding emergent structure in multi-sample biological data with the dual geometry of cells and features    A fundamental question in biomedical data analysis is how to capture biological heterogeneity and characterize the complex spectrum of health states (or disease conditions) in patient cohorts. Indeed, much effort has been invested in developing new technologies that provide groundbreaking collections of genomic information at a single cell resolution, unlocking numerous potential advances in understanding the progression and driving forces of biological states. However, these new biomedical technologies produce large volumes of data, quantified by numerous measurements, and often collected in many batches or samples (e.g., from different patients, locations, or times). Exploration and understanding of such data are challenging tasks, but the potential for new discoveries at a level previously not possible justifies the considerable effort required to overcome these difficulties.  In this project we focus on multi-sample single-cell data, e.g., from a multi-patient cohort, where data points represent cells, data features represent gene expressions or protein abundances, and samples (e.g., considered as separate batches or datasets) represent patients. We consider a duality or interaction between constructing an intrinsic geometry of cells (e.g., with manifold learning techniques) and processing data features as signals over it (e.g., with graph signal processing techniques). We propose the utilization of this duality for several data exploration tasks, including data denoising, identifying noise-invariant phenomena, cluster characterization, and aligning cellular features over multiple datasets. Furthermore, we expect the dual multiresolution organization of data points and features to allow us to compute aggregated signatures that represent patients, and then provide a novel data embedding that reveals multiscale structure from the cellular level to the patient level.  The proposed research combines recent advances in several fields at the forefront of data science, including geometric deep learning, manifold learning, and harmonic analysis. The methods developed in this project will provide novel advances in each of these fields, while also establishing new relations between them. Furthermore, the challenges addressed by these methods are a foundational prerequisite for new advances in genomic research, and more generally in empirical data analysis where data is collected in varying experimental environments. The developed algorithms and methods in this project will be validated in several biomedical settings, including characterizing Zika immunity in Dengue patients, tracking progress of Lyme disease, and predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy. In this project we will develop new algorithms for biomedical data analysis that will characterize the complex spectrum of health states across various patient populations. These algorithms will leverage the large volumes of data collected by new biomedical technologies, focusing on single-cell data. Specific analysis will be carried out for characterizing Zika immunity in Dengue patients, tracking progress of Lyme disease, and predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy.",Finding emergent structure in multi-sample biological data with the dual geometry of cells and features   ,10236365,R01GM135929,"['Algorithms ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Dengue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Health ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Learning ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Biological ', ' Measurement ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' driving force ', ' patient population ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' Geometry ', ' signal processing ', ' Data Science ', ' biological heterogeneity ', ' deep learning ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sets ', ' ZIKA ', ' data exploration ', ' ']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,353150

"Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases Project Summary/Abstract Many diseases are understudied because they are rare or of little public interest. The effect of each understudied disease may be limited, but the cumulative effects of all these diseases could be profound. One common research challenge for these diseases is that the resources allocated to each is often limited. For instance, large- scale screening of drugs is often challenging, if not possible, in small labs. The decreasing costs of next generation sequencing make possible the generation of gene expression profiles of understudied disease samples. Integrating these expression profiles with other open data provides tremendous opportunities to gain insights into disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutics for understudied diseases. We have utilized a systems-based approach that employs gene expression profiles of disease samples and drug-induced gene expression profiles from cancer cell lines to predict new therapeutic candidates for hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma and basal cell carcinoma. All these candidates were successfully validated in preclinical models. The success of this approach relies on multiscale procedures, such as quality control of disease samples, selection of appropriate reference tissues, evaluation of disease signatures, and weighting cell lines. There is a plethora of relevant datasets and analysis modules that are publicly available, yet are isolated in distinct silos, making it tedious to implement this approach in translational research. A centralized informatics system that allows prediction of therapeutics for further experimental validation is thus of great interest to researchers working on understudied diseases. Accordingly, we propose four specific aims: 1) developing novel deep learning methods to select precise reference normal tissues for disease signature creation, 2) developing computational methods to reuse drug profiles from other disease models for drug prediction, 3) integrating open efficacy data to identify new targets from the systems-based approach, and 4) developing a centralized platform and promoting the platform in the scientific community. This proposal will reuse several big open databases (e.g., TCGA, TARGET, GTEx, GEO, LINCS, CTRP, GDSC) and employ cutting-edge informatics methods (e.g., deep learning). To demonstrate the scalability of the system, we will investigate three representative understudied diseases: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Aim 1), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (Aim 2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Aim 3). Successful implementation of the systems-based approach can be used as a model for using other large open omics (proteins, metabolites) to discover therapeutics for diseases with unmet needs. This proposal will bring together experts in informatics, statistics, computer science, and physicians from Michigan State University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Spectrum Health. All data and code will be released to the public for continuing development. The system will be deployed to our OCTAD portal (http://octad.org), an open workplace for therapeutic discovery. Project Narrative About 25 million people are living with understudied diseases in the U.S. Although there are voluminous high dimensional molecular datasets that could be leveraged for research, individual labs have limited computational capacity to translate these molecular features into therapeutic hits. We propose to build a centralized information system that allows individual labs to easily harness open gene expression datasets and generate new therapeutic targets or drug candidates for further

"Innovative Vaccine Approaches ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Innovative Vaccine Approaches, organized by Drs. Mariagrazia Pizza, Galit Alter and Gordon Dougan. The conference will be held in Vancouver, Canada from June 27- July 1, 2021. Vaccines have the power to prevent and potentially eradicate a wide range of infectious diseases, representing one of the most effective life-saving measures at our disposal against global health threats. The recent coronavirus pandemic has brought the importance and urgency of vaccine development efforts into sharp focus. Moreover, the vaccinology field is evolving very rapidly, thanks to advances in our understanding of microbiology, immunology and genomics, as well as advances in structural analysis of antigens and antigen- antibody complexes and impacts of variation. Over the years, this field has also experienced an elucidation of mechanisms of immunity and protection, and identification of correlates. However, many questions are still unsolved and innovative approaches are needed to address new vaccine challenges like antimicrobial resistance, emerging infectious diseases, cancer and diseases associated with our aging population. This conference will cover the latest advances and novel approaches towards vaccine development, including: (1) novel antigen delivery systems; (2) in vitro and in vivo model systems for vaccine appraisal (3) the use of human challenge models; (4) the role of ‘systems biology’ in the comprehensive analysis of immune correlates, biomarker identification and safety; (5) machine-learning approaches to define correlations between antibody repertoires and protection; and (6) strategies for developing low cost vaccines for economically challenged populations. Together these topics will provide attendees with the new ideas and tools to continue to forge new frontiers in vaccine capabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Vaccines have the power to prevent and potentially eradicate a wide range of both infectious and non- infectious diseases.

"Multifidelity and multiscale modeling of the spleen function in sickle cell disease with in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo validations Project Summary The spleen plays a key role in the human immune system but also clears senescent red blood cells (RBC) from the circulation and those altered by acquired or inherited diseases. In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the spleen is one of the first targets of pathogenic processes and a potential protector against major complications. Under hypoxic conditions, mutated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes to fibers which increase both the stiffness and adhesion of RBC. Splenic filtration of altered RBC prone to sickling (a process that cannot be directly observed in human subjects) contributes to anemia and likely triggers acute splenic sequestration crises (ASSC). On the other hand, it potentially prevents complications associated with intravascular sickling. Self- amplified blockade of vessels with sickled RBCs is indeed a hallmark of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and acute hepatic crises, that severely impact the life quality and expectancy of patients with SCD. We propose to formulate and validate a new predictive modeling framework for how the spleen filters altered RBC in SCD by synergistically integrating in silico, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo data using multifidelity-based neural networks (NN). This will deliver predictive models that can continuously learn when new data become available, a paradigm shift in biomedical modeling. We will develop multiscale/multifidelity computational models (and corresponding NN implementations) that link sub-cellular, cellular, and vessel level phenomena spanning across four orders of magnitude in spatio-temporal scales. This scale coupling will be accomplished using a molecular dynamics/dissipative particle dynamics (MD/DPD) framework. We will validate these predictive computational models by data from in vitro and ex vivo experiments, and RBC quantitative features collected in SCD patients. Specifically, we will use three new spleen-on-a-chip microfluidic devices with oxygen control and the unique human spleen perfusion setup of our foreign partner, with the following aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a splenic inter-endothelial slit filtration model; Aim 2: Develop new models of RBC macrophage adhesion and of phagocytosis in the spleen; Aim 3: Perform Spleen-on-a-Chip experiments and validation; Aim 4: Validate the predictive framework based on RBC samples from patients. Realization of our four Specific Aims will significantly increase our understanding of the complex pathogenic and protective roles of the spleen in SCD. Feeding our new multifidelity neural networks with morphological and functional measures of RBC circulating in SCD patients will lead to models for residual spleen function in SCD, which should help predict the risk of acute splenic sequestration crises, and guide optimal timing for Stem Cell Transplantation or Gene Therapy. The new paradigm in using deep learning tools to integrate data from different sources will be applicable to modeling many other blood diseases. Project Narrative In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the spleen is the target of early pathogenic processes and a potential protector against major complications. We will formulate and validate predictive multiscale models for red blood cell (RBC) filtration by the spleen based on new deep learning neural networks fed with data from simulations, experiments using new spleen-mimetic microfluidics, and RBC quantitative features from ex vivo perfusion of human spleens and from SCD patients.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy.

"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States.

"Copper-mediated Radiofluorination: from Proof-of-Concept to Clinical Impact Abstract: Radiotracers containing [18F]-labeled electron-rich aromatic rings are among the most highly sought- after PET imaging agents but have been historically challenging to synthesize. Recent efforts have sought to improve the late-stage labeling of (hetero)arenes with [18F]fluoride. In particular, transition metal-mediated reactions using high molar activity [18F]fluoride have changed the way radiochemists form C–18F bonds, and copper-mediated radiofluorination (CMRF) has proven one of the most versatile of approaches. In the previous award, we reported 10 new CMRF reactions, validated them for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and used them to synthesize FDA-approved clinical doses. However, despite many successes, several key challenges remain for the widespread clinical application of CMRF: (a) many important organic scaffolds are incompatible with existing CMRF processes, (b) yields of automated CMRF methods are typically moderate and thus unsuitable for commercial distribution, and (c) disposable cassette technologies are not available for CMRF on automated radiosynthesizers, limiting radiotracer production for routine clinical use. All of these challenges will be addressed in this renewal proposal. The overall objective is to develop robust methods for clinical production of diverse PET radiotracers. Our central hypothesis is that CMRF is uniquely positioned to enable us to achieve this goal. The proposed research will identify new reactions to radiofluorinate scaffolds that are incompatible with existing CMRF (Aim 1), use cutting edge machine learning techniques to improve automated CMRF yields (Aim 2), and develop cassette technologies for reliable GMP production of clinical radiotracers using CMRF (Aim 3). The research is significant because it entails development of methods for radiolabeling bioactive molecules containing functionality that is incompatible (or low yielding) with existing CMRF (heterocycles like pyridine and morpholine, drug molecules like GW405833), as well as optimized automated methods and cassettes for radiotracers that have been challenging to access for decades (e.g. [18F]FDOPA). The viability of the proposed efforts is supported by extensive preliminary results that provide groundwork for the exciting new research directions. Our team has been collaborating for 7 years and our expertise in transition metal catalysis (Sanford), radiochemistry (Scott), and machine learning (Doyle) uniquely positions us to accomplish the proposed research. The project goals will be accomplished through a variety of innovations including: (1) developing methods for labeling challenging electron-rich (hetero)arenes from new precursors (C–H bonds, aryl halides), (2) the first application of machine learning to radiochemistry, and (3) development of automated cassettes for conducting CMRF using the newest generation of radiosynthesizers designed for plug-and-play production. Overall, this project will deliver multiple new methods for synthesizing 18F-labeled radiotracers that are inaccessible using existing methods, and validated clinical syntheses of important radiotracers. All of these deliverables will expand the utility of PET imaging for the detection, treatment, and prevention of disease. Project Narrative: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a non-invasive molecular imaging technique that allows real-time in vivo monitoring of physiological processes via administration of a radiotracer (a molecule tagged with a PET radioisotope) to a patient. Currently, PET imaging finds application in drug discovery, disease diagnosis and monitoring, and personalized medicine. Approximately 2 million PET scans are conducted annually, and there is significant room for further growth. However, the impact of PET cannot be fully realized without both new synthetic methods for the assembly of radiotracers as well as the translation of these synthesis methods to routine clinical production. The overall objective of our research is to develop new chemistry for preparing currently inaccessible PET radiotracers, use machine learning techniques to optimize production yields with these new methods, and introduce automated cassette technology that will allow easy and confident use of this new chemistry to produce PET radiotracers for clinical trials and routine standard of care.",Copper-mediated Radiofluorination: from Proof-of-Concept to Clinical Impact,10209444,R01EB021155,"['Adoption ', ' Automation ', ' Award ', ' Catalysis ', ' Chemistry ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Copper ', ' Cu element ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Fluorides ', ' Fluorine ', ' F element ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Levodopa ', ' L-Dopa ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' morpholine ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Play ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' pyridine ', ' Radiochemistry ', ' Radiation Chemistry ', ' Radioisotopes ', ' Radioactive Isotopes ', ' Radionuclides ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Emission-Computed Tomography ', ' Computed Tomographic Scintigraphy ', ' Computerized Emission Tomography ', ' Radionuclide CAT Scan ', ' radionuclide emission tomography ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Side ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Nuclear ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' success ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' transition metal ', ' Transition Elements ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Radiolabeled ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' molecular imaging ', ' molecule imaging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' FDA approved ', ' standard of care ', ' aryl halide ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' imaging agent ', ' imaging detection ', ' imaging-based detection ', ' imaging-based disease detection ', ' in vivo monitoring ', ' neural network ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' preclinical imaging ', ' pre-clinical imaging ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,377343
"Robust biomimetic models of human legs to solve high-dimensional real-time control problems Project Summary  Anatomically validated musculoskeletal models of human limbs computed faster than real-time are tools that will help advance the control of neuroprosthetics, rehabilitation, and the study of motor control principles. However, the current state-of-the-art models cannot be both accurate and fast. We propose to develop a new generation of validated real-time human leg models with musculoskeletal dynamics that are robust over the full range of multidimensional motion. The first aim is to validate a lower-limb model in the full range of static postures. The second aim is to validate a lower-limb model during dynamic locomotor tasks.  Building on our previous work, we will use OpenSim model repository as a starting point for the iterative process of validating the muscle anatomy and function using published anatomical data. We expect to recreate the full range of leg postures with the validated model. We will then collect data during locomotor tasks performed by healthy humans on the split-belt treadmill with simultaneous re- cordings of ground reaction forces, full-body motion capture, and surface electromyography from rep- resentative leg muscles. The model will be validated over a rich experimental dataset for locomotor pat- terns required in asymmetric stepping on a self-paced treadmill. We expect to validate the dynamic model by estimating in real-time the observed full body kinematics from muscle activity and ground reaction forces. The inverse solutions will allow us to estimate the ongoing spatiotemporal patterns of muscle activity.  At the conclusion of this study we will develop the detailed lower-limb model with high-di- mensional robust muscle path simulations to predict limb motion in real-time. The outcomes of this proposal will inform future work on the use of the real-time musculoskeletal models for the develop- ment of augmentation devices and the clinical assessment of locomotor deficits. Project Narrative The significance of this project is that it will address the major challenges in achieving intuitive human-computer interactions by allowing the simulation of high-dimensional muscle dynamics in real-time. The main innovation of this proposal is the rigorous validation of human leg model across large anthropomorphic variations (due to age and sex) and the robust performance using novel method for musculoskeletal simulations.",Robust biomimetic models of human legs to solve high-dimensional real-time control problems,10208921,R03HD099426,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electromyography ', ' Engineering ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Methods ', ' Polynomial Models ', ' polynomials ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Musculoskeletal System ', ' locomotor system ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Posture ', ' Publishing ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Articular Range of Motion ', ' Joint Range of Motion ', ' range of motion ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthetics ', ' base ', ' computer human interaction ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Intuition ', ' Measurement ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Reaction ', ' Slide ', ' Pattern ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-prosthetic ', ' neuroprosthetic ', ' neuroprosthesis ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Biological Mimetics ', ' Biomimetics ', ' realtime model ', ' real time model ', ' model development ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Leg ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Exercise Physiology ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Neuromechanics ', ' neuromechanical ', ' locomotor deficit ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' motor control ', ' locomotor tasks ', ' arm ', ' treadmill ', ' high dimensionality ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' ']",NICHD,WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,76000
"Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, there are nearly 13,000 patients waitlisted for liver transplant, yet only two-thirds will receive a transplant, and in 2018 approximately 2,500 patients died or were removed from the waitlist due to medical deterioration. This shortage of donor livers available for transplant has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are higher risk than typical donor livers but may be safely transplantable in carefully selected recipients. These include older donors (>70 years), steatotic livers, and livers procured through donation after cardiac death. Due to their riskiness, these marginal livers are often declined, yet as many as 84% of patients who died on the transplant waitlist declined one or more marginal livers prior to death. In light of this, certain waitlisted candidates might have derived a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a marginal organ rather than remaining on the waitlist (i.e. they would have survived longer after a transplant with a marginal liver than they would have survived on the waitlist). Currently, decisions about whether a particular marginal liver is suitable for a particular candidate are based on clinical gestalt or simple subgroup analysis using traditional regression models, which likely do not fully approximate the complex interactions between donor, recipient, and transplant factors. To account for this, we will utilize machine learning (which can incorporate complex, higher-order interactions) to predict whether a specific candidate would derive a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a specific marginal liver, and interview transplant candidates and surgeons to understand how best to translate these predictions into an immediately clinically-useful decision aid. To accomplish this, we will leverage Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) national data (n=293,140) and use a machine technique (random forests) to address the following aims: (1) To predict waitlist survival for waitlisted liver transplant candidates; (2) To predict post-transplant survival for liver transplant recipients of a marginal liver; and (3) To create a decision aid that compares predicted waitlist survival and predicted post-transplant survival for a specific transplant candidates with marginal liver. These aims are highly feasible given our group’s expertise in liver transplantation, analysis of national registry data, and machine learning techniques. We hypothesize that utilizing SRTR and machine learning, we can accurately predict post-transplant survival for a particular candidate with a particular marginal liver, as well as waitlist survival for that same candidate without a liver. We also hypothesize that our decision aid could be utilized in real-time to inform clinical decision-making. If the proposed aims are achieved, our decision aid could be utilized to improve clinical practice by bringing high-quality risk prediction directly to patients and transplant professionals to directly inform the real-time clinical decision of whether a candidate should undergo transplant with a marginal liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are far fewer donor livers available for transplant than patients who need them, which has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are riskier than typical donor livers but yet might still provide a benefit to carefully selected patients. However, the decision to use a particular marginal liver for a particular patient is based largely on clinical gestalt or traditional clinical studies, which likely do not account for the complex relationships between donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics. To optimally inform the decision to undergo transplantation with a marginal liver or not, we propose to utilize machine learning to generate personalized risk predictions of post-transplant survival with that specific marginal liver and waitlist survival without that liver, and then develop a decision aid to be used by patients and surgeons to compare predicted survival between both options.",Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation,10208791,F32DK124962,"['Accounting ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' liver transplantation ', ' Hepatic Transplantation ', ' Liver Grafting ', ' Liver Transplant ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Patients ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Statistical Computing ', ' statistical process ', ' statistical reasoning ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Cardiac Death ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' Transplant Surgeon ', ' cohort ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Instruction ', ' Population ', ' transplant registry ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' public health research ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' data registry ', ' clinical investigation ', ' personalized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' survival prediction ', ' predict survival ', ' predictor of survival ', ' recruit ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' random forest ', ' post-transplant ', ' post-transplantation ', ' posttransplant ', ' posttransplantation ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,84562
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics Electroencephalography (EEG), the first function brain activity imaging modality, has several natural advantages over metabolic brain imaging modalities. EEG is noninvasive, low cost, and lightweight enough to be highly mobile. Two major shifts in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data are now ongoing. The first is a shift to using EEG data as a source-resolved, relatively high-resolution cortical source imaging modality. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), began as a set of EEG data analysis running on Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) released by Makeig on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now nearly twenty years later, the EEGLAB reference paper [4] has over 6,750 citations (now increasing by over 4 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links 6,000 researchers, the EEGLAB news list over 15,000 researchers, and an independent 2011 survey of 687 research respondents reported EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis in cognitive neuroscience. Our statistics show that after over the past four years, EEGLAB adoption is still growing steadily. Here, we will develop a framework for thorough comparison of preprocessing methods, and will apply machine learning methods on the large body of data collected by our laboratory to build optimized, automated data processing pipelines. We will greatly augment the power of the EEGLAB environment by providing a cross-study meta-analysis capability and will revise the software architecture to use a file and metadata organization compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) framework first developed for fMRI/MRI data archiving. These tools will integrate the HED annotating system allowing for meta-analysis across large corpus of studies. We will implement beamforming within EEGLAB. We will develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for clustering effective sources on multiple measures across subjects and studies, and will develop tools to perform statistical testing on information flow measures at these scales. Although EEG and MEG recording have co- existed for four decades, little available software can combine both data types, recorded concurrently (`MEEG' data), to enhance source separation. We recently showed that ICA decomposition also allows joint MEEG effective source decomposition and will integrate MEG and joint MEEG data decomposition and imaging into the EEGLAB tool set. We will build tools to use MRI- and fMRI-derived anatomical atlases to inform the interpretation of EEG and MEG brain source dynamics. These radical improvements will further the use of non-invasive human electrophysiology for 3-D functional cortical brain imaging in the U.S. and worldwide, thereby accelerating progress in noninvasive basic and clinical human brain research using highly time- and space-resolved measures of brain electromagnetic dynamics. The EEGLAB signal processing environment is now used in many electrophysiological research and teaching laboratories worldwide. To accelerate progress in basic and clinical cognitive neuroscience, we will continue maintenance and development of the EEGLAB environment, introducing new tools for source separation and localization, source clustering, automatic artifact management, and across-studies meta-analysis, and will extend its scope to process magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and joint EEG/MEG data and to highlight parallels between EEG/MEG source dynamics and results of existing research using fMRI and other brain imaging.",EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain

"Use of a Machine Learning Approach to Impute Gene Expression in African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY Multi-omics data has been invaluable in understanding the potential mechanisms behind SNP associations. Using paired genomic and transcriptomic data allows investigators to determine the tissue specific effects of non-coding variation. However, most of this type of data exists for mostly European ancestry populations. Linear models have been developed which that can impute gene expression from genotype data  mostly created from the GTEx resource. This resource contains paired genotype and gene expression data on 44 human tissues. Unfortunately, these models are built mostly on European data; they do not perform as well on African American (AA) cohorts. To alleviate this disparity in both knowledge and data we are proposing to use both or own African American paired data as well as public African American data to create linear and machine learning models to impute gene expression. We will then assess the utility of these models in predicting the risk on venous thromboembolism in our ACCOuNT cohort. By building on our current knowledge of transcriptome imputation, we will be advancing these methods to understudies admixed populations. NARRATIVE Paired genomic and transcriptomic data has previously been used to create gene expression imputation models. However, the majority of the data used to create these models were from European Ancestry individuals. We will create both linear and machine learning models using African American data to improve the imputation of gene expression in this understudied population and test the utility of these model to predict venous thromboembolism.",Use of a Machine Learning Approach to Impute Gene Expression in African Americans,10199406,R21HG011695,"['Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' response ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Inheritance Patterns ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' disease phenotype ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' recruit ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' venous thromboembolism ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Linear Models ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Mosaicism ', ' mosaic disorders ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' ']",NHGRI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2021,239250
"Manifold representations and active learning for 21 st century biology Project Summary With the rise of high-throughput sequencing and multiplexed biotechnologies enabling single-cell multi-omics and massively parallel CRISPR experiments, the biomedical community is generating a monumental amount of data. These data promise to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. However, the sheer volume of genomic data is overwhelming current computational resources, requiring prohibitively high compute time, memory usage, and storage. My lab has been at the forefront of solving big data challenges in genomics, designing novel algorithms that enable efficient and secure analyses that were previously computationally infeasible, and that reveal novel structural, cellular, and systems biology. Drawing upon our expertise in developing scalable and insightful algorithms for analyzing genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, we aim to tackle two key data-driven challenges facing the biological community: 1) efficient, accurate, and robust characterization of tissues at the single-cell level, and 2) translating high-throughput datasets into biological discoveries via machine learning-based prediction. To solve the first challenge, we will leverage our discovery that seemingly high-dimensional sequencing data often lies on low-dimensional manifolds that capture the underlying biological state of interest. We will design algorithms that generate these compact, meaningful manifold representations of single-cell omics datasets. This will enable a number of key applications including characterizing co-expression and gene-modules that define healthy and pathologic cell states; integrating multi-modal single-cell omics datasets to more richly characterize cellular diversity; and investigating the mechanisms underlying transcriptomic diversity across tissues and developmental states. To solve the second challenge, we will take a two-pronged approach. First, we will design novel machine learning frameworks that provide a measure of confidence when predicting in unfamiliar biological states, enabling prediction that is robust to “out-of-distribution” (unobserved) examples. We will then work with our experimental collaborators and CROs to rapidly perform experimental validation of model-based predictions. Finally, we will return the experimental results to the model to further improve performance. This will enable an “active learning” feedback loop to efficiently explore a complex biological space for outcomes of interest. We will use this uncertainty-powered active learning approach to explore several pressing biological concerns such as the identification of small molecule compounds with enzymatic or whole-cell growth inhibitory properties, efficient design of spatial- transcriptomic experiments, computationally guided CRISPR perturbation experiments, and identification of functional non-coding mutations. This project will result in 1) numerous software tools with wide utility that efficiently analyze massive biological datasets and guide complex experimentation, and 2) reveal biological insights, especially into biomolecular interactions and cellular heterogeneity. Project Narrative The rise of high-throughput genomic profiling of individual cells and efficient, targeted manipulation of cellular phenotypes (including CRISPR-based genetic perturbations) promise to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and disease. However, realizing this revolution will require new computing paradigms that can integrate and analyze these massive datasets and suggest new biological hypotheses and experimental designs. Here we develop novel computational algorithms and software for tackling these challenges to characterize cellular diversity and improve our ability to manipulate cells to understand and treat disease.",Manifold representations and active learning for 21 st century biology,10207091,R35GM141861,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Feedback ', ' Genes ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Memory ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' State Interests ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' structural biology ', ' novel ', ' Spatial Design ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Proteomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' transcriptomics ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Secure ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,478341
"COPD SUBTYPES AND EARLY PREDICTION USING INTEGRATIVE PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODELS COPD SUBTYPING AND EARLY PREDICTION USING INTEGRATIVE PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODELS ABSTRACT One of the main obstacles in developing efficient personalized therapeutic and disease management strategies is that most common diseases are typically defined based on symptoms and clinical measurements, although they are believed to be syndromes, consisting of multiple subtypes with variable etiology. Identifying disease subtypes has thus become very important, but so far it has been met with limited success for most diseases. In asthma, a notable exception, it was the clinical characterization that led to successful subtyping; and this is now incorporated in treatment guidelines. Unsupervised machine learning approaches of single data modalities (e.g., omics, radiographic images) have not produced actionable subtypes due to instability across cohorts. Developing data integrative approaches for multi-scale data, which are becoming available for a number of diseases, is expected to lead to robust subtyping and provide mechanistic insights of disease onset and progression. This proposal focuses on developing new computational methods, based on probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), to address this unmet need; and apply them to investigate three problems of clinical importance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the fourth leading cause of mortality in USA. Our underlying hypothesis is that PGMs can integrate and analyze under the same probabilistic framework heterogeneous biomedical data (omics, chest CT scan, clinical) and identify disease subtypes and their main determinants. The objectives of our proposal is to build a comprehensive computational framework for disease subclassification, identify stable COPD subtypes at the baseline and longitudinally, and build interpretable models of the disease The deliverables of this project are: (1) new integrative computational approaches for clinical subtyping from multi-scale data; (2) new predictors of COPD progression and severity; (3) new discoveries of longitudinally stable COPD subtypes; (4) new predictors of future development of COPD; (5) new omics datasets that will be invaluable to future research in the area (baseline and longitudinal). To ensure the success of the project we follow a team science approach. This multi-PI proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of graphical models and their applications in biomedicine; and the ongoing collaboration of the three PIs that have complementary strengths: Prof. Benos (systems medicine and machine learning), Dr. Hersh (COPD genetics and genomics) and Dr. Sciurba (clinical aspects of COPD). It is powered by the access of the investigators to three major COPD cohorts (COPDGene®, SCCOR, ECLIPSE) that contain multiple parallel deep phenotyping and omics data from thousands of patients and controls. Although in this project we focus on COPD, our methods are generally applicable to any disease, therefore our project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables. We believe that due to their robust nature and interpretability, PGMs will soon become the norm for multi-scale biomedical data integration and modeling, when genetic and genomic data collection will become routine prognostic and diagnostic tools in clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the etiology of complex diseases and categorizing patients from samples taken from easily accessible tissues (like blood) are two very important aspects that will lead to development of new precision medicine strategies. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational methods and tools that will allow researchers to identify subphenotypes in any disease. We will apply these methods on three cohorts with thousands of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and our results are expected to help us understand the complexities of this disease and build predictors of future development.",COPD SUBTYPES AND EARLY PREDICTION USING INTEGRATIVE PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODELS,10206417,R01HL157879,"['airway obstruction ', ' airflow

"Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of newly emerging computational tools for data science, biostatisticians need to play a fundamental role in health sciences research. There is an urgent need to encourage US Citizens and Permanent Residents to pursue graduate training in biostatistics. The design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials and observational studies; the setting of regulatory policy; and the conception of laboratory experiments have been shaped by the fundamental contributions of biostatisticians for decades. Advances in genomics, medical imaging technologies, and computational biology; the increasing emphasis on precision and evidence-based medicine; and the widespread adoption of electronic health records; demand the skills of biostatisticians trained to collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary environment and to develop statistical and machine learning methods to address the challenges presented by this data-rich revolutionary era of health sciences research. The proposed summer program which includes world-renowned clinical scientists and biostatisticians from two local universities, will provide an immense opportunity for student participants to learn basic yet modern statistical methods that are critical to uncovering new insights from such big and complex biomedical data and also illustrate the potential pitfalls of confounding and bias that may arise when analyzing biomedical data. A unique feature of the proposed training program is thus to expose the participants to not only basic statistical methods but also to the topics of computer science and bioinformatics which will be invaluable in creating the multidisciplinary teams required to tackle the complex research questions that often requires multipronged approaches. The proposed six-week training program will be structured around the NIH's Translation Science Spectrum and will introduce participants to opportunities in biostatistics through the lens of the science advanced by the contributions of biostatisticians. Following an initial set of weeks on basic training of biostatistical methods, the program will culminate in a data hack-a-thon style competition in which participants will employ the statistical and scientific knowledge gained during the program to produce the most innovative, statistically-sound, scientifically-relevant and effectively-communicated response to a set of research questions. The proposed research education program will enroll up to 20 such participants from across the nation and, through lectures, field trips, and opportunities to analyze data from real health sciences, inspire them to pursue graduate training. The program will draw upon considerable past collaborations and complementary resources of two local world-renowned universities to provide participants with an unparalleled view of the field, including award-winning instructors, internationally known methodological and clinical researchers, and a local area rich in opportunities to showcase careers in biostatistics. Special efforts will be made to enroll participants from underrepresented groups. Participants will be followed after completion, and the numbers attending graduate school in statistics and pursuing biostatistics careers will be documented. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biostatisticians are indispensible contributors to health sciences research. The demand for professionals with advanced training in biostatistics is high and will continue to increase, especially with the expanding challenges posed by big biomedical data. This six week summer research education program, a joint effort of North Carolina State University and Duke University, will enroll up to 20 US citizen/permanent resident participants from across the nation in the summers of 2020-2022 and expose them to the opportunities presented by careers in biostatistics and encourage them to seek graduate training in the field.",Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences,10219349,R25HL147228,"['Adoption ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Communities ', ' Conceptions ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' North Carolina ', ' Play ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' sound ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Talents ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' analytical method ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' instructor ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' graduate student ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' investigator training ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' public health research ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergrad ', ' undergraduate ', ' summer institute ', ' summer program ', ' summer session ', ' summer research ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' lab experiment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' education research ', ' field trip ', ' Data Science ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' under representation of groups ', ' under represented groups ', ' under represented populations ', ' underrepresentation of groups ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large scale biomedical data sets ', ' large scale biomedical datasets ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' clinical trial analysis ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2021,249789
"Understanding the regulation and impact of transposable elements in Vertebrate health and disease Project summary  The overarching goal of my lab is to understand understudied mechanisms of genomic regulation, and how they influence lifelong Vertebrate health and disease. In multi-cellular organisms, diverse cell types are characterized by specific genomic regulation patterns, and the precise control of these patterns is key not only for development, but also for cell/tissue homeostasis in adults. Indeed, loss of fine control in genomic regulation has been linked to disease (e.g. cancer, neurodegeneration) and age-related functional decline. An interesting and understudied family of genomic elements lies in dormant genetic parasites (e.g. transposons, also called “jumping genes”). Although transposons can represent up to 80% of some eukaryotic genomes, they remain critically understudied, since they were historically dismissed as unimportant (i.e. “junk DNA”), and their high copy numbers and repetitive nature pose unique technical challenges. Consistent with their potential impact in health and disease, the ability of cells to suppress transposon activity is disrupted with disease and with aging. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that many aspects of biology and genomic regulation differ between males and females, including emerging data suggesting potential sex-dimorphism in transposon activity. However, how transposable elements are regulated throughout life in healthy somatic tissues and across biological sexes, and how they influence vertebrate health, remains largely unknown. Thus, we propose to decipher how transposons are controlled in healthy somatic cells (including in male vs. female cells), and how loss of that control could influence Vertebrate health and disease. To explore this question, my group will use a unique combination of ‘omics’ approaches, machine-learning, and experimental validation in animal models. We use two vertebrate models for their respective strengths: the laboratory mouse (e.g. powerful genetics, validated antibodies, etc.) and the African turquoise killifish, a naturally short-lived model organism I have helped develop (e.g. short generation time/lifespan, strain diversity, cost-effectiveness, etc.). First, we will decipher sex-dimorphic regulation of transposon activity, determining the impact of gonadal hormones vs. sex- chromosomes on such regulation. Second, we will use functional genomics to identify new regulators of transposon activity in somatic cells. Finally, we will evaluate the impact of transposon control in key somatic tissues and across sexes on lifelong vertebrate health using the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish as a model. Ultimately, understanding the fine control of transposon in healthy cells will help devise strategies to prevent their misregulation in disease, by allowing us to maintain youthful and healthy genomic regulation landscapes. 1 Project narrative  Disruption of genomic regulation is accompanied by striking functional changes across cell types and species. However, how mobile genetic elements are regulated throughout life, across biological sexes, and how they influence physiology in response to external or internal cues, remains largely unknown. By leveraging big data and state-of-the-art experimental approaches on vertebrate models including mouse and the emerging African turquoise killifish, the proposed research program will advance our understanding of mobile genetic element control in healthy somatic cells, and shed light on how these elements can influence vertebrate health and disease. 1",Understanding the regulation and impact of transposable elements in Vertebrate health and disease,10265910,R35GM142395,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aging ', ' Antibodies ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Transposable Elements ', ' Transposable Elements ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' male ', ' Laboratory mice ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Parasites ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Sex Chromosomes ', ' Gonosomes ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Generations ', ' Link ', ' African ', ' Gonadal Hormones ', ' Genetic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' sex dimorphism ', ' sexually dimorphic ', ' sexual dimorphism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' gene desert ', ' Junk DNA ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Jumping Genes ', ' Mobile Genetic Elements ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Killifishes ', ' biological sex ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R35,2021,412500
"Paneth cell phenotype as a predictive biomarker for ulcerative colitis ABSTRACT One of the challenges for the management of ulcerative colitis (UC; a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease) is the lacking of a predictive biomarker that can help stratify patients for personalized treatment strategies. We have previously shown that in Crohn’s disease (CD; another subtype of inflammatory bowel disease), the morphologic phenotype of small intestinal Paneth cells readily predicts outcome in post-surgical CD patients. Given the shared genetic etiology and clinical features between CD and UC, we hypothesize that Paneth cell phenotype will also predict outcome in UC. Our long-term goal is to define the clinical indications of inflammatory bowel disease of which Paneth cell phenotype can predict outcome. The objective of this grant is to determine to the extent of which Paneth cell phenotype predicts development of ileal complications in UC. The central hypothesis is that in UC patients undergoing total colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA), the Paneth cell phenotype obtained at time of colectomy will predict development of pouchitis and de novo CD in the ileal pouch. Our rationale is that Paneth cell phenotype will offer better outcome prediction over current practice. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim1) Paneth cell phenotype correlates with ileal complications in UC patients with IPAA; (Aim 2) Deep learning will reduce observer variation and enhance rigor and reproducibility of Paneth cell phenotype analysis in surgical pathology specimens, and also identify novel clinical factors that correlate with Paneth cell function; (Aim 3) Serum markers that correlate with Paneth cell phenotype could be used to predict outcome in UC. Upon conclusion, we will understand the role for Paneth cell function in modulating disease course in IBD. This contribution is significant since it will establish Paneth cell phenotype as a critical predictive biomarker for IBD. The proposed research is innovative because we use state-of-the-art deep learning approach to build an imaging analysis pipeline, and to identify novel clinical factors that affect Paneth cell functions. Identifying how epithelial cells with innate immune function affect disease course will provide insight into other inflammatory disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to the public health because ulcerative colitis, which is increasing in prevalence worldwide, represents a major national cost measured by both patient suffering and economic burden. Despite significant advances in care, clinical trial data demonstrate remission rates is at best of 40%. Strategies that stratify patients based on Paneth cell function represent a novel approach for outcome prediction. Upon conclusion, we will establish that Paneth cell phenotype is a predictive cellular biomarker for ileal complications in ulcerative colitis patients undergoing total colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis. We will also define the underlying genetic associations and molecular pathways of abnormal Paneth cell phenotype in these patients. In addition, we will develop deep learning algorithms that will streamline the interpretation of Paneth cell phenotype for pathology specimens, and define serum markers that correlate with Paneth cell phenotype to allow for less invasive and more frequent monitoring.",Paneth cell phenotype as a predictive biomarker for ulcerative colitis,10269023,R01DK124274,"['Affect ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colectomy ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Cost Measures ', ' Cost metrics ', ' cost measurement ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's "", "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' regional enteritis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Nonspecific Immunity ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Small Intestines ', ' small bowel ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Observer Variation ', ' Observer Bias ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Ileal Reservoirs ', ' Ileal Pouches ', ' Caring ', ' Serum Markers ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' prognostic ', ' intestinal epithelium ', ' Paneth Cells ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' insight ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Morphology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Pathologist ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Pouch Ileitis ', ' Pouchitis ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' cohort ', ' Anastomosis ', ' Anastomosis - action ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Monitor ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' cell morphology ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' combinatorial ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' innate immune function ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' dysbiosis ', ' dysbacteriosis ', ' dysbiotic ', ' microbial imbalance ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' gut homeostasis ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,362276
"Adapting a machine learning algorithm to predict thyroid cytopathologyin LMIC Abstract Pathology expertise and services in low and middle income countries (LMIC) are severely inadequate and limited. One area in which pathology is especially critical for diagnosis and clinical decision making is thyroid related disease and cancers. The incidences of thyroid nodules and cancers have increased worldwide. A fundamental part of the clinical assessment for thyroid nodules is ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Unfortunately, this cytopathology expertise is scarce in LMIC and many nodules are surgically removed for diagnosis. Since 90-95% of these nodules are without malignancy, many patients undergo unnecessary surgery with the associated risks, financial costs, and stressing already limited resources. What is critically needed is a means to provide cytopathology expertise to interpret thyroid FNAB in LMIC. The overall goal of this proposal is to implement our ML approach into low resource settings to provide accurate and timely cytopathology analysis of FNAB specimens. This R21/33 proposal focuses on MLA adaptation using smartphones for LMIC (R21) and subsequent capacity building and implementation (R33) through well-established LMIC research partnerships in tertiary centers in Tanzania and Vietnam. We hypothesize that our MLA can use smartphone captured images to assess probability of malignancy in thyroid FNAB that is comparable to trained cytopathologists. Our Aims are: R21: Adaptation of a smartphone approach to capture cytopathology images for MLA analysis. Archived FNAB samples used at different international institutions will be used to train and adapt the MLA with these images. Furthermore, we would train local personnel in LMIC to image capture using this new setup. The results from this phase will be an adapted MLA using smartphone images that has comparable sensitivity and specificity to the original MLA. R33: Implementation of the smartphone MLA approach into LMIC clinical settings. A prospective implementation of this approach in tertiary centers in Tanzania and Vietnam will be conducted. FNAB samples obtained would undergo standard of care pathology assessment as well as be analyzed with the MLA protocol. Local cytopathologist assessment will be compared with the MLA analysis. Outcome measures include MLA assessment of slides, technical slide review and image capture, concordance with pathology between MLA and expertise both in US and LMIC. The expected outcome will lead to a cost-effective method to implement MLA for thyroid FNAB that can be used in LMIC. This approach will not only assist in early diagnosis of thyroid cancers but also improve the utilization of limited resources through effectively identifying those that need surgery from those that do not. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cytopathology plays a critical role in the assessment of fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) of thyroid nodules that may harbor cancers. This expertise is a scarce resource in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC). This project will tailor an existing machine learning algorithm for use in LMIC, specifically Tanzania and Vietnam, in order to have a future protocol in which expert cytopathology can be immediately accessible using existing equipment and mobile devices.

"Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms that are marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation, affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this CHR population is critical to prevent psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. Thus, to improve predictive models that are clinically relevant, several issues need to be addressed: 1) focusing on outcomes beyond psychosis; 2) taking into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) integrating data sets with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms to overcome variability across studies. To address these challenges, the proposed “Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center” (PREDICT-DPACC) brings together a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced researchers with proven capabilities in all aspects of large-scale studies, CHR studies, as well as computational expertise. The ultimate goal is to identify new CHR biomarkers, and CHR subtypes that will enhance future clinical trials. To do so, the PREDICT-DPACC will 1) aggregate extant CHR- related data sets from legacy datasets; 2) provide collaborative management, direction, data processing and coordination for new U01 multisite network(s); and 3) develop and apply advanced algorithms to identify biomarkers that predict outcomes, and to stratify CHR into subtypes based on outcome trajectories, first from the extant data and then refined and applied to the new data. The PREDICT-DPACC team has the broad, comprehensive, and robust infrastructure that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the inclusion of multiple data types and to optimally address the needs of the CHR U01 network(s). Carefully selected extant data will be rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Proposed analysis methods are powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced clinical researchers. The U01 network(s) will be coordinated by a team that is experienced in managing large studies, familiar with the needs of such studies, flexible, and is knowledgeable in all aspects of CHR studies, including measures, outcomes, biomarkers, and cohorts. Upon meeting the goals of this U24, and the supported U01 network(s), the expected outcomes of the PREDICT-DPACC will be new predictive biomarkers for CHR outcomes, new definitions of CHR subtypes that are clinically useful, and new curated and comprehensive CHR datasets (extant and new) as well as processing tools and prediction algorithms that are shared with the research community through the NIMH Data Archive. NARRATIVE The “Clinical High Risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome in young people represents an opportune window for early intervention to prevent the onset of psychosis and other disorders, and to forestall disability; however, clinical heterogeneity and the paucity of biomarkers have hampered the development of effective intervention. To address these challenges, working with NIMH and key stakeholders, we will harmonize and aggregate existing “legacy” CHR data, and guide and coordinate the collection of new data across a network of sites, to develop biomarker algorithms that can predict individual trajectories for diverse outcomes. This proposal leverages a multidisciplinary team with broad and CHR-specific experience in large-scale multisite and multimodal studies (including clinical trials), along with expertise in data type-specific processing, coordination, analysis, and computational analyses (e.g., machine and deep learning tools from artificial intelligence, and advanced statistical approaches), ethics, community outreach, and data dissemination, all of which will ensure the success of this project.","Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data

"Computational Methods for Enhancing Privacy in Biomedical Data Sharing Project Summary Data sharing is essential to modern biomedical data science. Access to a large amount of genomic and clinical data can help us better understand human genetics and its impact on health and disease. However, the sensitive nature of biomedical information presents a key bottleneck in data sharing and collection efforts, limiting the utility of these data for science. The goal of this project is to leverage cutting-edge advances in cryptography and information theory to develop innovative computational frameworks for privacy-preserving sharing and analysis of biomedical data. We will draw upon our recent success in developing secure pipelines for collaborative biomedical analyses to address the imminent need to share sensitive data securely and at scale.  Practical adoption of existing privacy-preserving techniques in biomedicine has thus far been largely limited due to two major pitfalls, which this project overcomes with novel technical advances. First, emerging cryptographic data sharing frameworks, which promise to enable collaborative analysis pipelines that securely combine data across multiple institutions with theoretical privacy guarantees, are too costly to support complex and large-scale computations required in biomedical analyses. In this project, we will build upon recent advances in cryptography (e.g., secure distributed computation, pseudorandom correlation, zero-knowledge proofs) to significantly enhance the scalability and security of cryptographic biomedical data sharing pipelines. Second, existing approaches that locally transform data to protect sensitive information before sharing (e.g. de-identification techniques) either offer insufficient levels of protection or require excessive perturbation in order to ensure privacy. We will draw upon recent tools from information theory to develop effective local privacy protection methods that achieve superior utility-privacy tradeoffs on a range of biomedical data including genomes, transcriptomes, and medical images by directly exploiting the latent correlation structure of the data.  To promote the use of our privacy techniques, we will create production-grade software of our tools and publicly release them. We will also actively participate in international standard-setting organizations in genomics, e.g. GA4GH and ICDA, to incorporate our insights into community guidelines for biomedical privacy. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods and software tools that open the door to secure sharing and analysis of massive sets of sensitive genomic and clinical data. Our long-term goal is to broadly enable data sharing and collaboration efforts in biomedicine, thus empowering researchers to better understand the molecular basis of human health and to drive translation of new biological insights to the clinic. Project Narrative Rapidly-growing volume of biomedical datasets around the world promises to enable unprecedented insights into human health and disease. However, increasing concerns for individual privacy severely limited the extent of data sharing in the field. This project draws upon cutting-edge tools from cryptography and information theory to develop effective privacy- preserving methods for collecting, sharing, and analyzing sensitive biomedical data to empower advances in genomics and medicine.",Computational Methods for Enhancing Privacy in Biomedical Data Sharing,10260457,DP5OD029574,"['Adoption ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Foundations ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Information Theory ', ' Institutes ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Polynomial Models ', ' polynomials ', ' Modernization ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Privatization ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Translations ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Genomics ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Preservation Technique ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Security ', ' Molecular ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' cost ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' cryptography ', ' task analysis ', ' data sharing ', ' Secure ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' privacy protection ', ' Data Science ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' web server ', ' biomedical data science ', ' privacy preservation ', ' ']",OD,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",DP5,2021,392800
"Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution Project Summary/Abstract It is hard to overstate the importance of monoclonal antibodies in the life sciences. Antibodies are critical tools in biomedical research and diagnostics (e.g. western blotting, immunoprecipitation, cytometry, biomarker discovery, and histology), are one of the most rapidly growing class of therapeutics, and are the basis for myriad new strategies in cancer therapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors that are revolutionizing treatment. Unfortunately, current methods for the generation of custom antibodies, including animal immunization and phage display, are slow, costly, inaccessible to most researchers, and often unsuccessful. We propose Autonomously EvolvinG Yeast-displayed antibodieS (AEGYS), a system for the continuous and rapid evolution of high-quality antibodies against custom antigens that requires only the simple culturing of yeast cells. We believe this can be achieved by combining cutting-edge generative machine learning algorithms for antibody library design with a new technology for in vivo continuous evolution and a yeast antigen-presenting cell that we will engineer. If successful, AEGYS should have a transformative impact across the whole of biomedicine by turning monoclonal antibody generation into a rapid, scalable, and accessible process where any lab with standard molecular biology capabilities can generate custom antibodies on demand simply by “immunizing” a test tube of yeast cells with an antigen. We anticipate that this democratization of antibody generation will also result in an explosion of crowdsourced antibody sequence data that will train our machine learning algorithms to design better antibody libraries for AEGYS, starting a virtuous cycle. We ourselves will use AEGYS to generate a panel of subtype- and conformation-specific nanobodies against biogenic amine receptors including those that respond to acetylcholine, adrenaline, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters, so that we can understand their role in neurobiology and addiction.! Project Narrative This proposal will provide a system for the scalable continuous evolution and computational design of antibodies against user-selected antigens. Antibodies are critical tools in medical research and are the basis for numerous therapies, but the generation of custom antibodies against new targets is a difficult and specialized task. The system proposed will turn antibody generation into a routine and widely accessible process for researchers in almost any field.","Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution",10260452,R01CA260415,"['Acetylcholine ', ' Animals ', ' Antibodies ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Antibody Affinity ', ' antigen antibody affinity ', ' Antibody Formation ', ' Ab response ', ' Antibody Production ', ' antibody biosynthesis ', ' immunoglobulin biosynthesis ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells ', ' accessory cell ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Western Blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' protein blotting ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Detergents ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epinephrine ', ' Adrenaline ', ' Therapeutic Epinephrine ', ' Evolution ', ' Explosion ', ' Genes ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybridomas ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunoglobulin Fragments ', ' Antibody Fragments ', ' Immunoprecipitation ', ' Immune Precipitation ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nobel Prize ', ' Pheromone ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Production ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Reagent ', ' Cell Surface Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Yeasts ', ' Generations ', ' Medical Research ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Biogenic Amine Receptors ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' empowered ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' structural biology ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Proteome ', ' Cytometry ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' antigen bound ', ' antigen binding ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Therapeutic Studies ', ' Therapy Research ', ' in vivo ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Collection ', ' Phage Display ', ' Update ', ' V(D)J Recombination ', ' Immunoglobulin V(D)J Rearrangement ', ' V(D)J Rearrangement ', ' VDJ rearrangement ', ' VDJ recombination ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' decision research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' antibody engineering ', ' nanobodies ', ' nanobody ', ' sdAb ', ' single domain antibodies ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' antibody libraries ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Immune checkpoint inhibitor ', ' Checkpoint inhibitor ', ' immune check point inhibitor ', ' Immunize ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2021,1665161
"Deep learning approaches to decipher the impact of mobile element insertion on alternative splicing in neurological disorders The purpose of this training and research application is to study the functional impact of mobile element insertions (MEIs) in neurological disorders (NDs) using new developments in deep learning techniques. MEIs are transposable DNA fragments that are able to insert throughout the human genome. There are at least 124 independent MEIs associated with human diseases. Approximately 20% of these diseases represent a spectrum of NDs, yet the overall contribute of MEIs to the etiology of NDs has not been systematically estimated. To address this, we will (1) characterize functional MEIs in GTEx cohorts in healthy individuals; (2) build a comprehensive functional map of MEIs to determine tissue-specific and brain-specific impact; and (3) impute transcriptional changes on various NDs where whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data will be generated. The proposed application will also develop an extensive research program for Dr. Dadi Gao, a computational biologist and statistical geneticist who has trained in functional genomic studies of alternative splicing in neurodegenerative disorders and therapeutic targeting of a splicing defect that causes a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. He has developed novel methods to investigate regulation of the transcriptome and to facilitate analyses in drug development. He now seeks to expand his expertise by applying statistical and deep learning models on large cohorts of sequencing data from controls and cases with NDs from post-mortem tissues, then impute functional consequences of MEIs from WGS in large-scale disease cohorts. The training plan consists of two years of mentored research to learn new skills in genome analysis, MEI characterization, and advanced deep learning techniques, followed by three years of shaping an independent laboratory. The research plan is developed to comprehensively explore functional variation in the genome by decomposing transcriptomic changes against MEIs. Dr. Michael Talkowski at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard, and the Broad Institute will serve as the primary mentor, while Dr. Manolis Kellis at MIT and the MIT Computational Biology Group, and the Broad Institute will serve as a co-mentor and close collaborator. These mentors are recognized experts in genomic structural variants, functional genomics, the genetics of neurological disorders, and computational modeling to establish functional elements in the human genome. In addition, a team of independent investigators from basic and translational research will provide Dr. Gao with comprehensive feedback to keep both his science and career development on track. The highly collaborative environment in CGM, MGH, Harvard Medical School, the Broad Institute and the University of Michigan Medical School will prepare Dr. Gao for his transition to an independent investigator. This outstanding mentorship team and training program will facilitate the career development of Dr. Gao as he seeks to redefine the functional maps of MEIs in the human genome and to impute their impact in large-scale neurological disorders. Mobile element insertions (MEIs) represent a largely undefined component of the genetic architecture of neurological disorders, as a number of MEIs have been associated with alternative splicing in these disorders but large-scale genome-wide functional characterization has not been systematically performed across tissues. This program study will functionally characterize the impact of MEIs on alternative splicing from whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing in large cohorts using new developments in deep learning models. These results will enhance our understanding of the etiological role and pathogenic mechanisms associated with MEIs in neuronal development and human neurological disorders.",Deep learning approaches

"Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging our therapeutic strategies. Drug resistance occurs as a result of this evolution when drug pressure changes the balance of molecular recognition events, selectively weakening inhibitor binding while maintaining the biological function of the therapeutic target. Disrupting the therapeutic target’s activity is necessary but not sufficient to avoid resistance. We hypothesize that the multi-dimensional landscape of resistance evolution can be elucidated through integration of experimental and computational data to reveal the key pathways and coupled molecular mechanisms to resistance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this strategy can be incorporated into structure-based drug design to evaluate novel inhibitors.  Resistance occurs under gradual and persistent drug pressure, and interestingly the mutations are not limited to the active site of a drug target, but can occur throughout the enzyme to confer high levels of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which this resistance occurs is not clear. Our aim is to exploit the rich and versatile experimental data, integrating inhibitor potency and crystallographic structures with ensemble dynamics in an internally consistent manner using machine learning to elucidate both the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and generate predictive models of inhibitor potency.

"Personalized 3D avatar tool development for measurement of body perception across gender identities Abstract Public awareness of the diversity of experiences of gender identities has climbed sharply. The specific issues of those with gender dysphoria (GD) related to self-identity, body image, and medical interventions are challenges for the 21st century, particularly given the high risk of suicide. Gender identity is tightly linked to one’s bodily features, particularly readily observable sexual characteristics. For transgender and nonbinary individuals with GD, the incongruence between their body associated with their birth-assigned sex – what they see in the mirror before any treatment – and the internalized representation of their gender-identified body is a key defining part of their experience and contributes to their dysphoria. Currently, no clinical or research tool exists to capture and quantify the diverse experiences of one’s current body and one’s gender-identified body (which may be distinct from their current body), across a range of gender identities. Measuring the internalized representation of one’s body could be facilitated by technology to visually represent this on a three-dimensional avatar. The technology needed to scan and analyze the human figure is now available and cost efficient. It is now possible to scan individuals to create personalized 3D visualizations, or “avatars,” with which they can interact on mobile and desktop devices to represent internal representation of their bodies. This can allow individuals to see and manipulate their own 3D avatar with a high degree of flexibility. The goal of this project is to create a novel, visually based digital tool to measure, understand, and quantify individuals’ experiences of their bodies. We will develop, validate, and test in transgender, nonbinary, and cisgender adults a personalized avatar tool to represent internalized gender-identified bodies in order to quantify incongruence between this and one’s current body. This tool – “GD Somatomap” – will be an advancement over existing self-report questionnaires to capture visual representations of internalized body image, cross-sectionally and dynamically over time. It will be flexible enough to characterize the heterogenous experiences of a range of gender identities including binary transgender, gender fluid, nonbinary, and cisgender. It can be used in clinical and clinical research applications to track outcomes of cross-hormone and gender-affirming surgical treatments. It can potentially improve clinical outcomes by identifying specific sets of body parts as targets for treatments to improve body congruence. Further, it will provide a unique means to measure own-body perceptual accuracy; understanding differences in perceptual accuracy and what potentially modifiable factors contribute to this may have prognostic significance for treatments to address body incongruence. It could also be used in future studies to investigate functional and structural neurobiological correlates of body perception and internal body representation, and at what point in neurodevelopment these emerge for those with different gender identities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The internalized, conscious experience of one’s body is not easily communicated, much less measured and quantified. This is especially relevant for those with gender dysphoria, whose internal, gender-identified body representation is incongruent with their current body. We will develop and test an innovative technological solution, making use of 3D image reconstruction and advanced 3D modeling, to create personalized avatars to measure body incongruence for research and clinical applications in those with gender dysphoria.",Personalized 3D avatar tool development for measurement of body perception across gender identities,10480133,R21EB030851,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Awareness ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' Breast ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' sex steroid ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Body Measures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Waist-Hip Ratio ', ' waist-to-hip ratio ', ' Link ', ' Body part ', ' Distress ', ' dysphoria ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Hormonal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' morphologic criteria ', ' morphologic signature ', ' morphological criteria ', ' morphological signature ', ' Physical shape ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' body dissatisfaction ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' tool development ', ' high risk ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' cisgender ', ' cis-gender ', ' prognostic significance ', ' gender fluid ', ' gender fluidity ', ' genderfluid ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' three-dimensional visualization ', ' 3-D visualization ', ' 3-dimensional visualization ', ' 3D visualization ', ' ']",NIBIB,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R21,2021,167495
"A fully automated PET radiomics framework Summary The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a fully automated PET radiomics framework and evaluate the efficacy of PET radiomic features (RFs) derived from this framework in predicting therapy response in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Radiomics is showing exciting promise in deriving biomarkers for several diseases. The potential to measure and evaluate the efficacy of radiomic features derived from PET for early prediction of therapy response is highly impactful since PET probes the functional characteristics of the tumor, where changes are manifested sooner in comparison to anatomical changes. However, PET images have high noise and limited resolution, which leads to inaccurate and imprecise RF measurements that then have limited clinical value. Previously we have developed techniques to optimize quantitative imaging methods and shown that these can help estimate more reliable quantitative metrics leading to better predictive ability with these metrics. Building on these past studies and by combining concepts from imaging physics, statistical inference theory, deep learning, we propose to develop methods that accurately and precisely estimate RFs from PET. These methods will include a fully automated PET segmentation method that will enable reliable delineation of tumor boundaries using a practical approach. Next, a no-gold-standard (NGS) evaluation technique will be developed to optimize RF quantification protocols. This technique will provide a mechanism for precise measurement of RFs from PET images without access to the ground truth RF value. The methods will be rigorously validated in the context of measuring radiomics features in patients with NSCLC using a combination of realistic simulations, physical phantom studies and existing patient data. Select RFs will then be retrospectively evaluated on predicting therapy response using existing data the ACRIN 6697 longitudinal clinical trial in patients with stage III NSCLC. A strong multidisciplinary team has been assembled for this project, consisting of an imaging scientist, clinical nuclear-medicine radiologists, medical oncologist with expertise in biomarker development for thoracic malignancies and biology of NSCLC, biostatistician, and a medical physicist. The proposed methods are poised to have a strong impact on PET radiomics by enabling measurement of precise and accurate RFs, and by facilitating the clinical translation of PET radiomics. The impact is strengthened as we investigate the predictive ability of the PET RFs in patients with stage III NSCLC, a leading cause of death with low overall survival, and with an important and timely need for improved personalized therapy regimens. Further, the methods developed in this project are general and potentially impact precision-medicine approaches for other cancers as well as other diseases where PET imaging has a clinical role. Project Narrative There is an important need to develop biomarkers for early prediction of therapy response for personalizing treatments. The proposed project will develop and validate methods to compute radiomic features from PET and retrospectively evaluate their ability to predict therapy response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

"Scaling up computational genomics with tree sequences Project Summary/Abstract Increasing sample size is a tremendously important factor in building our understanding of the genetics of human disease. As we discover that more and more diseases have a complex web of genetic causation, we need larger and larger genetic datasets to disentangle them, and to ultimately produce successful therapies. Driven in part by this need, the community is now assembling vast collections of human genome sequences, and millions of samples will soon be commonplace. Nonhuman datasets, with applications in epidemiology, ecology, and evolution, will not be far behind. There is a profound problem, however: our computational methods for storing, processing, simulating, and analyzing genomic data are lagging far behind our ability to collect such data. The algorithms and data structures underlying today's computational methods were designed for thousands of samples, not millions, and we are in danger of being overwhelmed by the impending tsunami of data. Without a fundamental change in how we store and process genomic data, we will either not fully tap the potential of the data we collect, or the computational costs will be astronomical – or both.  Our proposal addresses this critical need by focusing on a new data structure: the succinct tree sequence. This data structure (the “tree sequence”, for brevity) encodes genetic variation data using the population ge- netics processes that produced the data itself – by representing variation among contemporary samples via mutations on the branches of the underlying genealogical trees. This yields extraordinary levels of data com- pression, with ﬁle sizes hundreds of times smaller than current community standards. Since the tree sequence was introduced in 2016 it has led to performance increases of 2–4 orders of magnitude in the diverse applica- tions of genome simulation, calculation of statistics, and ancestry inference. Such sudden leaps in computa- tional performance are vanishingly rare, and only possible through deep algorithmic advances.  Our research plan builds on the extraordinary successes of tree sequence methods so far, scaling up three crucial layers of computational genomics: analysis, simulation, and inference. First, we will continue our development of highly efﬁcient tree-sequence-based methods for fundamental operations in statistical and population genetics. Second, we will scale up genome simulations by integrating tree sequence methods into complex forward-time simulations, utilizing modern, multicore processors. Third, we will combine efﬁcient genome simulations with cutting-edge deep-learning methods to improve existing inference methods, both of tree sequences from genomic data, and of population parameters from novel tree-sequence encodings of genotype data. Together, we aim to revolutionize the way we work with population genetic variation data, and how we use it to understand human health and evolutionary processes.  Our experienced, interdisciplinary team is committed to producing rigorously tested and validated software and accessible, interoperable, and reusable data formats through inclusive and open development. Narrative We are collecting genetic data at an ever-increasing rate, driven largely by our success in understanding both rare and common diseases using today's vast genomic datasets. Our computational methods are lagging far behind, however, and without fundamental improvements in how we store and process genomic data, we may never fully realize the potential health beneﬁts of the data we are gathering. Our project applies the revolutionary “succinct tree sequence” data structure – which has yielded orders-of-magnitude gains in decades-old problems since its recent introduction – to produce further major gains in fundamental genomics algorithms, genome simulation, and inference from genomic data.",Scaling up computational genomics with tree sequences,10471496,R56HG011395,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Bionomics ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Evolution ', ' Genealogy ', ' Geneologies ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Population Sizes ', ' Production ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Genetic ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Processes ', ' Family Trees ', ' Genealogic Tree ', ' Genealogical Tree ', ' structural genomics ', ' compression algorithm ', ' Data Compression ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' Tsunami ', ' interoperability ', ' sequence learning ', ' data structure ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' multicore processor ', ' multiprocessor ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' data format ', ' operation ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' deep learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' algorithm development ', ' data reuse ', ' data re-use ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R56,2021,556834
"Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes Abstract Ciliopathies are a collection of debilitating developmental disorders (e.g. Joubert syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, polycystic kidney disease) which have no cures and limited but expensive treatments. Diagnosis and treatment is complicated due to ciliopathies causing multisystem pathologies and having large variance in their clinical presentations potentially resulting in neural tube defects, orofacial clefting, obesity, polycystic kidneys, retinal degeneration and in some cases, infant death. All ciliopathies are caused by dysfunctional cilia, the microtubule based organelle critical for cell-to-cell signaling, but currently there is limited understanding of the underlying molecular network responsible for proper cilia function. Recently, large-scale proteomic techniques have advanced where it is now possible to query the cell's molecular network and identify many new protein complexes. This proposal describes a research program that will 1) construct a ciliary complex map using proteomic techniques, 2) functionally characterize newly discovered ciliary complexes and 3) identify disruptions in complex assembly due to known ciliopathy mutations. Additional products of the proposed research will include a compendium of proteomic data on ciliated cells, statistical analysis tools for the discovery of protein complexes, functional characterization of critical ciliary processes and a more complete understanding of the underlying molecular network of ciliopathy disease states. This work aims to provide an important perspective of cilia biology in order to better understand the complex etiology and molecular causes of ciliopathies and potentially open new therapeutic avenues. Project Narrative Ciliopathies are a class of debilitating birth defects without known cures and limited but expensive treatments. Currently, we lack understanding of the underlying molecular network in ciliopathy patient cells and know even less about the causes of clinical presentations in ciliopathy patients.

Specifically, TR&D1 (Data Science) focuses on methodological developments for the management and informatics of brain and related data. This project will develop and issue new methods for robust scientific data management to create an environment where scientific analyses can be reproduced and/or enhanced, data can be easily discovered and reused, and analysis results can be visualized and made publicly searchable. TR&D2 (Diffusion MRI and Connectomics) seeks to advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects. (This technology and these methods will be managed and executed by the TR&D1 framework to distributed datasets totaling over 10,000 subjects).

"Developing cell-penetrating miniproteins as a new class of therapeutics Project Summary Current protein therapeutics have a major limitation: they generally cannot cross the cellular membrane or interact with cytosolic targets. The ability to design protein therapeutics that enter the cell cytosol would enable new therapeutic strategies across many disease areas, including cancer, autoimmunity, and neurological disease. Therapeutic “miniproteins” (30-60 residues in length) have the potential to address this challenge, and several miniproteins capable of efficiently reaching the cell cytosol have recently been identified. However, we lack a general understanding of the “design rules” for cell-penetrating miniproteins, limiting the development of this class of molecules. Furthermore, current approaches to measure cytosolic delivery require measuring each protein individually, which is slow and labor intensive. This makes it impossible to test large numbers of miniproteins to develop a robust, quantitative understanding of the determinants of cytosolic delivery. In this exploratory project, we will develop a new approach to measure delivery for each different protein in a large mixed pool, using targeted mass spectrometry to individually identify each miniprotein sequence. In our approach, a soluble mixed pool containing thousands of designed miniprotein sequences is incubated with cells, and miniproteins that enter those cells are captured by a cytosolic target. Miniproteins captured by the target are then purified out of the cellular contents and identified and quantified using targeted proteomics. The amount of each protein in the captured sample (relative to the starting sample) will provide a quantitative measure of delivery efficiency. This approach is unprecedented, and we will test and optimize this approach using different positive and negative control miniproteins, different library sizes, and different cell lines. With this method in hand, we will use approaches we previously pioneered to computationally design thousands of candidate cell-penetrating miniproteins with intentionally diverse sequence and structural properties. We will then quantify cytosolic delivery for these new proteins using our new high-throughput approach, creating unprecedented large-scale data on delivery efficiency. We will then use these data to build machine learning models that predict miniprotein delivery based on sequence and structural properties. Finally, we will repeatedly iterate, designing new miniprotein libraries based on our predictive models of delivery, testing these designs using our high-throughput experimental approach, and further updating our models. This iterative design-test- learn approach will build a robust, predictive understanding of the determinants of delivery. Ultimately, the ability to design cell-penetrating miniproteins will unlock a wide range of new therapeutic targets inside the cell.

"Elucidating sequence, structural and dynamic basis of the functional regulation of membrane proteins Project Summary The overall aim of the research is Shukla group is to develop computational methods that facilitate investigation of rare conformational transitions in proteins and help guide the design of experiments to validate the in silico predictions. In par- ticular, we apply these computational methods to investigate functional regulation of membrane proteins such as membrane transporters and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we propose development of transfer learning based methods to predict the effect of mutations on protein function and apply these methods to investigate monoamine transporters, sugar transporters and Class C GPCRs. Deep mutagenesis, whereby tens of thousands of mutational effects are determined by combining in vitro selections of sequence variants with Illumina sequencing, is an emerging technology for indirectly interrogating and observing protein conformations in living cells; the solving of an integrative structure of a neuronal class C G protein-coupled receptor in an active conformation by deep mutagenesis-guided modeling is one prominent example of this approach's success. Using deep mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations to inform each other, we plan to determine the mechanism of ion- coupled neurotransmitter import by monoamine transporters at atomic resolution. Fluorescent substrates have enabled us to use ﬂuorescence-based sorting of libraries of transporter mutants to ﬁnd mutations along the entire permeation pathway that increase or decrease substrate import. These comprehensive mutational landscapes will be used to interpret and support/reject hypotheses from simulations, including the role of ion-coupling in substrate transport regulation, proposed free energy barriers in the conformational-free energy landscape that limit import kinetics, and how sodium-neurotransmitter symport is coupled by a shared cytosolic exit pathway. Other notable features that arise from the deep mutational scans (e.g. putative regulatory sites) will be further explored, and a machine learning algorithm will be applied to transfer mutagenesis information to related transporters; the predicted mutational landscapes will then be validated by a small number of informative targeted mutants. We will further relate sequence to conformation and activity in metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors and sugar transporters. Finally, we plan to improve the proposed transfer algorithms by using deep learning techniques, which will facilitate integration of features derived from simulation datasets and multiple deep mutational scans to inform the effect of mutations on related proteins or tasks. The success of the proposed research program of results will be measured by development of algorithms that can accurately predict the variant effects on protein structure and function, elucidation of the mechanisms of ion-coupled regulation of neurotransmitter transport, selectivity mechanisms in sugar transporters and activation mechanisms of class C GPCRs. Narrative Advanced computational methods are needed to obtain comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the regulation of substrate transport via membrane transporter proteins. The research projects pursued in the PI's lab employ a synergistic combination of experiments, computational modeling and data-driven approaches to investigate neurotransmitter and sugar transporters.","Elucidating sequence, structural and dynamic basis of the functional regulation of membrane proteins",10275155,R35GM142745,"['Structure ', ' simulation ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' conformational conversion ', ' conformational transition ', ' mutation screening ', ' mutation scanning ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' algorithm development ', ' Algorithms ', ' Carrier Proteins ', ' Transport Protein Gene ', ' Transport Proteins ', ' Transporter Protein ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Fluorescence ', ' In Vitro ', ' Ions ', ' Kinetics ', ' Libraries ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Proteins ', ' Neurotransmitter Receptor ', ' Neurohumor Receptors ', ' Neuromediator Receptors ', ' Neuroregulator Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Measures ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ion Cotransport ', ' Symport ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' sugar ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' Membrane Transporters ', ' Membrane Transport Proteins ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' mutant ', ' neurotransmitter transport ', ' protein structure function ', ' success ', ' monoamine ', ' Free Energy ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2021,354588
"Unraveling subcellular heterogeneity of molecular coordination by machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy allow researchers to acquire an unprecedented amount of live cell image data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, these images pose a significant challenge for data analyses due to massive subcellular heterogeneity. Although conventional computer vision algorithms have facilitated automatic image analysis, traditional ensemble-averaging of subcellular heterogeneity could lead to the loss of critical mechanistic details. Given the current rapid growth of cell biological data from new technological development, it is nearly impossible to keep up with the data generation if we solely rely on human intelligence for algorithm development and data analysis. Recently, machine learning (ML) is making tremendous progress and has shown that computers can outperform humans in the analysis of complex high dimensional datasets. Conventional ML application in cell biology, however, is usually limited to fixed cells or low spatial resolution setting (single cell resolution), which is limited in analyzing dynamic subcellular information. To fill this voids, we have been developing an ML framework for fluorescence live cell image analyses at the subcellular level. In our previous study, we established the method to deconvolve the subcellular heterogeneity of lamellipodial protrusion from live cell imaging, which identified distinct subcellular protrusion phenotypes with differential drug susceptibility. Thus, our goal is to advance this ML framework and address technical and cell biological challenges in the live cell analysis. The overall goal of our research is two- fold: i) advancing a new ML framework for cell biological research (technological development) and ii) applying our ML framework to integrate mechanobiology and metabolism in cell protrusion (targeted cell biological study). First, we will advance our ML framework for the deconvolution of subcellular heterogeneity of protrusion and molecular coordination in live cells. This method will integrate time-series modeling and ML to deconvolve subcellular molecular coordination. Second, we will develop deep learning based high-throughput fluorescence live cell imaging. This will include microscope automation, resolution enhancement, and data synthesis, which will build up the massive dataset for ML. Third, we will apply our ML framework to study the mechanosensitivity of subcellular bioenergetic status in cell protrusion. We will evaluate how AMPK reacts to mechanical forces and controls the subcellular organization of actin assembly and mitochondria to promote energy-demanding protrusion phenotypes. Our ML framework will bring unprecedented analytical power to cell biology by analyzing a large numbers of individual cells at the high spatial resolution and automatically extracting a multitude of subcellular phenotypes. This framework can be applied to various areas of cell biology such as cytoskeleton, membrane remodeling, and membrane-bound organelles. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a novel machine learning framework for automated, large-scale analyses of single cells at the subcellular level. By integrating time-series modeling and machine learning, this new system will enable us to identify hidden phenotypes and molecular coordination from live cell movies.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10265790,U19AI135972,"['Animals ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', '

"Machine Learning and Control Principles for Computational Biology Summary/Abstract With our increasing ability to measure biological data at scale and the digitalization of health records, computational thinking is becoming ever more important in the biological science and healthcare. The research directions proposed in this grant look to build robust machine learning models and tool for computational biology by including principles and analysis from other engineering fields, like control, that have a proven record of incorporating robustness into the systems they have automated. This increased robustness will save resources during the development of these machine learning models. It will also lead to more reliable diagnostics, clinical tools, and machine learning based biological discoveries. We have proposed three future research directions at the intersection of machine learning, control, and computational biology (a) modeling dynamical systems, (b) robust optimization schemes (c) control principles for in vivo modeling of microbial communities. The first proposed research area involves the development of flexible models for performing inference on dynamical systems models with time-series data. Dynamical systems models are able to learn mathematically causal relationships between variables, compared to other models whose parameters may only have correlative relationships. Our flexible models will be differentiable allowing them to be trained using the same efficient algorithms and hardware that have propelled deep learning models into the spotlight. These differentiable methods will allow for us to more easily integrate the uncertainty associated with biological measurements into our models. The second research area looks to develop more robust gradient optimization algorithms, the work horse for training deep neural networks. Many of the popular algorithms used to train deep neural networks were not explicitly designed to be robust. By developing more robust optimization techniques machine learning models trained on disparate data sets at different hospital or labs will be more reproducible and will require less time for tuning parameters, ultimately saving resources as well. These robust optimization techniques will also aid in the certification of machine learning based tools that will ultimately be deployed in the clinic. The third research area we propose is an approach for the discovery and design of robust microbial communities. Communities of commensal, or engineered, bacteria have long been proposed as alternative therapies for the treatment of gut related illness (“bugs as drugs”). We propose a top down approach to identifying putative microbial consortia members from time-series experiments with germ free mice colonized by complex flora. By beginning the consortia design process in vivo we hope to overcome the challenge that many other attempts at consortia construction have encountered where in vitro designed communities do not reproduce their intended properties once transferred into living host organisms. The tools from this work will be built using open access software and all data will be made easily accessible and explorable to the public. Narrative The recent public successes of deep learning have reinvigorated computational thinking around healthcare and biology. This work develops rigorous methods and tools ensuring the efficient application of machine learning principles to computational biology. This will save resources and make these tools more reliable when they are ultimately deployed for diagnostic, research, or clinical purposes.",Machine Learning and Control Principles for Computational Biology,10276879,R35GM143056,"['Algorithms ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Certification ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Grant ', ' Equus caballus ', ' Domestic Horse ', ' Equine ', ' Equine Species ', ' Equus przewalskii ', ' Horses ', ' Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' success ', ' health record ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Alternative Therapies ', ' Data ', ' Diagnostics Research ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Germ-Free ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' mathematical learning ', ' math learning ', ' mathematics learning ', ' computational reasoning ', ' computational thinking ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' microbiota ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' digital health ', ' ']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R35,2021,447500
"Learning a molecular shape space for the adaptive immune system Project Summary  The adaptive immune system consists of highly diverse B- and T-cell receptors, which can recognize and neutralize a multitude of diverse pathogens. Immune recognition relies on molecular interactions between immune receptors and pathogens, which in turn is determined by the complementarity of their 3D structures and amino acid compositions, i.e., their shapes. Immune shape space has been previously introduced as an abstraction for such molecular recognition to explain how immune repertoires are organized to counter diverse pathogens. However, the relationships between immune receptor sequence, shape, and specificity are very difficult to quantify in practice. We propose to use recent advances in machine learning and the wealth of molecular data to infer an effective shape space, grounded in biophysics of protein interactions. The key is to find a representation of proteins in general, and of immune receptors, in particular, that reflects the relevant biophysical properties that determine a protein receptor’s stability, function, and interaction with pathogens.  Representation learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that uses large amounts of data to infer a reduced representation. Since protein function is closely related to the 3D structure, we will develop novel machine learning methods that use atomic coordinates of a protein structure as input and, through transformations that respect the physical symmetries in the data, learn representations that reflect biophysical properties of proteins and protein-protein interactions. We believe a key innovation in our approach is the analysis of amino acid neighborhoods within 3D protein structures. The distribution of these neighborhoods will reveal how they differ at the surface, in the bulk, and at functionally important regions such as catalytic sites. The learned protein representation will enable us to characterize how specific compositions of amino acid neighborhoods are the building blocks of protein structure and protein function. We will transfer the representation of protein universe to immune receptors to learn the immune shape space. The leaned immune shape space will enable us to address how affinity and specificity are encoded by immune receptors in different cell types. We will study how the modular structure of immune receptors, with separate pathogen engaging and framework regions, enables receptors to diversify and target a multitude of pathogens, without compromising their stability. We will use the complementary aspect of shape recognition to predict the antigenic targets of the immune receptors, and through collaborations, we will experimentally validate our predictions.  Our approach opens a new path towards interpretable computational models of proteins and immune receptors that describe how biological properties and biological function emerge from protein subunits. Additionally, the inferred molecular representations can be used as a generative model, where desired properties, such as antigenic targets, are specified and new proteins can be generated. Project Narrative The adaptive immune system can mount a specific response against a multitude of pathogens, through molecular recognition grounded in complex biophysics of protein-protein interaction. The proposed project aims to develop data-driven approaches to characterize a representation of protein interactions in general, and of immune receptors, in particular.

"Center for Molecular Imaging Technology and Translation (CMITT) Administrative Supplement #4 Abstract Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by the presence and distribution of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles tau and extracellular amyloid-β. Tau pathology is deeply associated with cognitive decline in AD in a region-specific manner. It will be highly valuable to predict how tau burden would spread in the future given a baseline tau PET measurement. Such approach can be used to predict how region-wise tau burden changes versus age and, therefore, stratify potential candidates for AD therapy based on their “trajectory” of progression. It can also be used to determine how different a tau PET distribution is after a therapy from the predicted distribution if no therapy is applied. The recent availability of longitudinal tau PET data provides us a unique opportunity for technology development: to model tau-propagation using state-of-the-art deep learning methods. However, current available longitudinal tau PET datasets are relatively small, therefore, insufficient to train a deep neural network. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a simple mathematical model in the training of the deep neural network. We first develop a simple network diffusion model that fits part of the available longitudinal tau PET data. We then generate a very large number of longitudinal tau PET datasets using the fitted model to pretrain a U-net-like autoencoder deep neural network. Finally, we further train the neural network by freezing all the parameters except those directly associated with the bottleneck layer of the neural network.

"Biology-aware machine learning methods for characterizing microbiome genotype and phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY 1 The Mirarab laboratory designs leading computational methods for answering biological and biomedical ques- 2 tions, focusing on scalability and accuracy. These methods span several areas (e.g., microbiome proﬁling, 3 multiple sequence alignment, and phylogenomics), and a common thread among them is evolutionary mod- 4 eling. The lab has developed scalable and accurate methods for reconstructing evolutionary histories (i.e.,  5 phylogenies) and using these histories in downstream biomedical applications. Reconstructing phylogenies is a  6 fundamental goal and a precursor to many biological analyses. Methods developed by this lab (e.g., ASTRAL) 7 are at the forefronts of modern genome-wide phylogenetics. Moreover, biomedical research increasingly uses 8 evolutionary histories in diverse areas like microbiome analyses, immunology, epidemiology, and comparative 9 genomics. While the lab has previously focused more on inferring species histories, it has recently started 10 to shift its focus to developing methods for microbiome analyses. The inference and the use of evolutionary 11 histories in analyzing environmental microbiome samples present a unique set of challenges. 12 In the next ﬁve years, the Mirarab lab will focus on designing, testing, and applying improved methods for 13 statistical analyses of microbiome data. These methods will target two questions. (i) Proﬁling: What organisms 14 constitute a given sample? (ii) Association: How are samples different in their organismal composition, and 15 how do these differences connect to measurable characteristics of their environment? While both questions 16 have been subject to considerable research, many computational challenges remain, providing an opportunity 17 for better methods to make a signiﬁcant impact. Instead of focusing solely on new algorithms, the lab will 18 also work on building better reference datasets and combining data from multiple sources. Thus, the project 19 aims to harness the unprecedented computational power, large available datasets, and recent advances in 20 machine learning to improve state-of-the-art dramatically. The project will not use off-the-shelf machine learning 21 methods in a black-box fashion. Instead, it develops methods that incorporate biological knowledge (e.g., of the 22 evolutionary relationships) into machine learning methods in a principled biologically-motivated fashion. 23 The lab will pursue several ambitious goals for both proﬁling and association questions. The project will 24 (i) create methods to infer a continuously-updated reference alignment and tree encompassing all sequenced 25 prokaryotic genomes (half a million currently) to be used for proﬁling, (ii) build methods for ultra-sensitive sam- 26 ple proﬁling, (iii) use deep learning to connect data obtained using amplicon sequencing and metagenomics, 27 (iv) build discordance-aware phylogenetic measures of sample differentiation, and (v) develop machine learning 28 methods for associating a proﬁled microbiome to phenotypes of interest such as disease. These new methods 29 will draw on statistics, machine learning, discrete optimization, and high-performance computing. Consistent 30 with the goals of MIRA, the project may explore new unforeseen opportunities if they ﬁt its general goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite intensive efforts to develop methods for analyzing fast-growing environmentally-sequenced microbiome data, many challenges remain, and there is substantial room for improvements. We will build several methods for building better reference datasets, increasing the accuracy of proﬁling contents of microbiome samples, and ﬁnding associations between changes in the proﬁle and phenotypes of interest. Our publicly available methods will use advanced algorithms, statistics, and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, but will adopt these techniques to incorporate a deep understanding of the evolutionary processes that shape the microbiome.",Biology-aware machine learning methods for characterizing microbiome genotype and phenotype,10275055,R35GM142725,"['Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Research ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Immunology ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' comparative ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' microbiome analysis ', ' analyze microbiome ', ' deep learning ', ' multiple data sources ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R35,2021,344669

"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs. Project Narrative This project addresses an increasingly prevalent health condition, inflammatory arthritis due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer. The proposal will allow for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis.

"Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS) PROJECT SUMMARY Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects up to 5% of couples, yet nearly half of cases remain unexplained by current testing recommendations. Euploid pregnancy loss, in the setting of unexplained RPL, is particularly frustrating for patients and providers because there is no clear explanation or any proven therapies to mitigate risk of subsequent miscarriages. As clinical presentation and subsequent pregnancy outcomes vary widely, this complex disorder will ultimately require a precision health approach. While more than 3000 human genes are conserved and likely essential for early development, remarkably little is known about their contribution to RPL and current genetic databases are essentially devoid of RPL entries. Moreover, there is currently no database that annotates phenotypes and genotypes of these essential genes. This proposal aims to define genetic determinants of RPL through clinical and molecular phenotyping and genomic sequencing of a large RPL cohort, combined with novel bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to derive predictive risk algorithms. A comprehensive approach to identify genomic markers of pregnancy loss by whole genome sequencing of well- characterized RPL trios (mother-father-pregnancy loss) will be undertaken in Aim 1. These genetics efforts will be paired in Aim 2 with metabolomic, lipidomic and single cell transcriptomic profiling preconception and in early pregnancy. Leveraged with innovative machine learning strategies in Aim 3, this approach will significantly advance understanding of the genetic underpinnings of unexplained RPL. A clinical ‘intolerome’ database will be constructed in Aim 4 to facilitate worldwide collaboration and curation of genotypes and associated phenotypes, making the genetics and omics data and results available to the public as well as other funded teams. This multidisciplinary team includes leaders in RPL, genetics, genomics, prenatal diagnosis, bioinformatics and machine learning at Stanford, UCSF and OHSU. Combined we have a substantial cohort of RPL patients that will serve as a robust recruitment source, along with a collaboration with the unique UK Pregnancy Baby BioBank of existing trios to accomplish project goals. The proposed study is anticipated to have significant clinical and research impact by identifying the genomic contribution to RPL in a large and well phenotyped cohort and building improved risk predictions based on machine learning incorporating clinical, genetic, and molecular data. This work will lay the foundation for precision medicine-based interventions for RPL couples who are difficult to diagnose and have few proven treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that there are very few proven treatments for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss, uncovering genetic mechanisms is crucial for identifying individuals at risk and initiating targeted, patient-centered treatments. The proposed work will provide unprecedented machine learning analysis to define the spectrum of genomic and clinical indicators for recurrent pregnancy loss, unparalleled molecular phenotyping through metabolomics and single cell RNA sequencing, and development of a publicly-available “intolerome” database which will provide the foundation for a future prenatal OMIM.",Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS),10225966,R01HD105256,"['Spontaneous abortion ', ' Miscarriage ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fathers ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Hematology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Mothers ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Prenatal Diagnosis ', ' Antenatal Diagnosis ', ' Intrauterine Diagnosis ', ' antepartum diagnosis ', ' intra-uterine diagnosis ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' reproductive system disorder ', ' Genital Disorders ', ' Reproductive System Disease ', ' reproductive disease ', ' reproductive disorder ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' catalog ', ' Catalogs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Essential Genes ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Pregnancy loss ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' reproductive ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' OMIM ', ' Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man ', ' Provider ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Seminal ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' treatment center ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' Structural Congenital Anomalies ', ' Structural Birth Defect ', ' congenital structural malformation ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Genetic study ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' genomic biomarker ', ' genomic marker ', ' phenotypic data ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' recruit ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Precision Health ', ' early pregnancy ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' genomic locus ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' lipidomics ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1465292
"Center for Mesoscale Mapping Overview of the Proposed Resource – Abstract The goal of the Center for Mesoscale Mapping is to drive the convergence of microscopic- and macroscopic- scale evaluation of brain structure and function for human translational neuroscience, by developing and applying tools to study the spatial distribution and temporal orchestration of mesoscopic events in the human brain. Our Collaborators will, through a dynamic “push-pull” relationship, provide unique problems which drive the development of these tools, and in return guide us in the design and optimization of our toolbox for practical use in a variety of normal and disease settings. While there is still no formal consensus on the definition of mesoscopic within the neuroscience community, we take as our guide the spatial and temporal scales at which local groups of neurons act in coherent fashion – in the cortex, this includes the spatial scale of columns and laminar structures (between ~0.1-1 mm), while in deeper structures includes the myriad of deep brain and brainstem nuclei. Preliminary data from our own center, and of course others throughout the world, now support the notion that we are on the threshold of being able to map, measure and perturb the human brain at these scales, and do so comprehensively across wide swaths of the human brain. Temporally too, recent advances suggest a convergence between temporal scales addressable with tools like fMRI, which can now investigate delta frequency coherent phenomena, and advanced electromagnetic tools to measure and perturb coherent electrophysiological activity at higher frequencies still. With this convergence in mind, the tools we proposed to develop within the TRDs of the CMM will provide our Collaborative and Service User community with the important “missing links” between the advances in human cognitive neuroscience at the “system level,” and the enormous strides in cellular level circuit functional characterization. Our Collaborators will bring their own unique challenges to help us define and further refine these tools, offering problems requiring distinct measures of human brain structural and functional properties in a variety of normal and disease settings. Our Service Users will utilize our tools to better understand human neural systems, and particularly human disease states from multiple sclerosis to Alzheimer’s, to depression and epilepsy. Finally, our Center will seek to disseminate these tools, through open-source software and hardware designs, industrial partnerships and “hands-on” teaching courses for hardware, and to train a new generation of human neuroscientists in the use of our advanced tools to explore the human brain at this next frontier. Overview of the Proposed Resource – Narrative The goal of the Center for Mesoscale Mapping is to drive the convergence of microscopic- and macroscopic- scale evaluation of brain structure and function for human translational neuroscience, by developing and applying tools to study the spatial distribution and temporal orchestration of mesoscopic events in the human brain.

"Understanding the control mechanisms of 3D cell migration from new dimensions Cell migration in 3D tissue space is of fundamental importance for human biology. However, predicting and programming 3D cell motility remain as major challenges despite of a firm picture of the molecular machineries involved. To fill the knowledge gap between the overwhelming subcellular details such as protein-protein interactions, and the fascinating dynamic patterns exhibited by different cell types in tissue spaces, I will focus on the mesoscale cellular dynamics, namely the migration mode transitions of cells in 3D extracellular matrix (ECM). My lab has developed deep-learning based image postprocessing to track the migration modes of cells. We also developed techniques to manipulate and measure the micromechanics of ECM at cellular scale. Based on these preliminary results, I will systematically study the intrinsic and extrinsic control mechanisms of 3D cell migration mode transitions in collagen ECM. The results will pave the way for my long-term goals to understand the organizing principle that lead molecules to life, and to program cell motility for applications in tissue engineering and cancer treatment. To this end, I will dedicate my lab to the following research thrusts. Thrust 1 aims to determine how cell migration mode transitions are regulated by external cues, as well as intrinsic states of cells during the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). I will test three hypotheses that elucidate the roles of ECM micromechanical stiffness, anisotropy, plasticity, synergy of mechanical and chemical guidance, as well as EMT stage in modulating the cell migration mode transitions. I will employ sophisticated ECM engineering and characterization techniques developed in my lab. I will also use genetically engineered cells whose EMT transcription factors are fluorescent labeled and can be specifically activated. Completion of thrust 1 will establish 3D cell migration as a hidden Markov process where the mesoscale dynamics, namely the migration mode transitions, provides a unifying framework to explain diverse dynamic patterns of 3D cell migration observed in vivo. Thrust 2 aims to devise strategies to program cell migration via nonstationary mechanical cues. In subproject 1, I will employ techniques developed in my lab to control 3D contact guidance cues in space and in real time. By measuring the migration mode transitions under step-increasing contact guidance, I will obtain the energy barriers that separate different modes. Then under periodic mechanical stimuli I will measure and computationally model the nonequilibrium mode transition flux, a statistical physics quantity that inform the efficiency and energy dissipation of cell motility responses. These mesoscale quantities shed light to the underlying molecular organizing principles. In subproject 2 I will develop collagen ECM which exhibits digital response to stresses using DNA-grafted nanoparticles as crosslinkers. I will design the DNA sequence to control the yield strength of crosslinkers, thereby programing cell migration mode both for single cell and for collective organoid migration. Completion of thrust 2 will expands the design space of engineered ECM, laying a foundation for the mechanical programing of 3D cell motility. 3D cell migration is of fundamental importance for both normal physiological processes such as in development, and disease progression such as cancer metastasis. Understanding the regulation and control mechanisms not only will advance our basic understanding of how cells mechanically interact with their environment, but will also lead to powerful strategies to facilitate therapeutic strategies in areas such as tissue regeneration, immune disorder and cancer.",Understanding the control mechanisms of 3D cell migration from new dimensions,10197977,R35GM138179,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Collagen ', ' Cues ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Markov Chains ', ' Markov Process ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Organoids ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Physics ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Measures ', ' Anisotropy ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Chemicals ', ' Epithelial ', ' Stimulus ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Dimensions ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' synergism ', ' fascinate ', ' Human Biology ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Crosslinker ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' tissue regeneration ', ' regenerate new tissue ', ' regenerate tissue ', ' regenerating damaged tissue ', ' regenerating tissue ', ' tissue renewal ', ' tissue specific regeneration ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanoparticle ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' migration ', ' genetically modified cells ', ' genetically engineered cells ', ' deep learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,352506
"Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes Project Summary Excess weight is associated with 13 types of cancer. These cancers disproportionately affect Black and Latinx individuals, as well as those with lower socioeconomic status, because overweight and obesity incidence is higher in these groups. Behavioral weight loss interventions are effective, but in-person interventions tend to have low reach. As mobile phone ownership is increasing in the United States, mHealth technology holds promise for reaching a larger population than in-person behavioral interventions. Furthermore, because they travel with individuals and can collect digital information in real-time, mHealth tools make it possible to intervene with individuals at the precise point when the interventions are needed with just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). As currently implemented, mHealth JITAIs are adaptive in the sense that interventionists can specify decision rules a priori that result in intervention messages that are triggered or tailored by certain events. These experimenter-specified decision rules are generally based upon results of prior studies, specifically micro-randomized trials that provide sequential tests of mHealth intervention messages in order to determine causal effects of messages conditional on user context. However, JITAIs that are developed in this manner cannot be truly individually tailored because the same decision rules are equally applied to everybody without regard to information about how individuals actually respond to intervention messages. Rapidly evolving machine learning methods, specifically reinforcement learning (RL), makes it possible to improve upon the current approach to JITAIs by learning each person's unique response patterns and integrating this information into subsequent, person-specific, adaptive decision rules. However, the few behavioral interventionists who have created mHealth JITAIs for weight loss using RL have noted high practical barriers to doing so because implementation of RL requires specialized expertise and can be labor intensive. The field needs a user-friendly tool to reduce these barriers in order for RL methodology to become widely adopted. Aim 1 is to develop Adapt, a tool that iteratively integrates real-time data, applies RL algorithms, and performs micro-randomized trials to optimize JITAI decision rules for weight loss. Adapt will pull in digital health data in real-time and conduct micro-randomized trials using behavioral patterns and outcomes to arrive at the most efficacious intervention message, delivered at the right time, for promoting weight loss in each participant. Aim 2 is to conduct a 12-week pilot feasibility study testing usability of Adapt in a weight loss intervention (NudgeRL). NudgeRL will build upon the team's existing JITAI, Nudge, which did not incorporate RL. The sample will consist of 20 adults with overweight or obesity, at least 50% of whom are Black or Latinx. Although Adapt will be developed to improve weight loss interventions, its widespread use will result in more efficient and efficacious JITAIs across a broad range of health outcomes, resulting in a lower burden of cancer and other disease due to a wide spectrum of improved health behaviors. Project Narrative The objective of this project is to develop a tool that will make it easier for behavioral interventionists to implement reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning, into adaptive mobile (mHealth) interventions, specifically those intended to promote weight control. Widespread use of this tool will result in more efficient and effective adaptive mHealth interventions, ultimately leading to a lower burden of obesity-linked disease, including cancer.",Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes,10195835,R21CA260092,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diet ', ' diets ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Ownership ', ' Positive Reinforcements ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' cancer prevention ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' Participant ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' weight control ', ' weight management ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' Obesity associated disease ', ' Obesity related disease ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer-related health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' weight loss therapy ', ' weight loss treatment ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' user-friendly ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' usability ', ' effective intervention ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' health data ', ' fitbit ', ' web-based tool ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' digital health ', ' efficacious intervention ', ' Latinx ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,410893
"Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL) is a common radiation-related toxicity that has been recognized for over a century but often ignored as clinically inconsequential. However, accumulating evidence has demonstrated strong association of high grade RIL (seen in 30-50% of patients) with poor prognosis. The pervasive role of radiotherapy in the curative management of solid tumors supports the need to develop mitigating strategies, particularly for patients with a high risk of developing grade 4 (G4) RIL. We have compelling evidence from both clinical and preclinical work that severe RIL impacts cancer control and therapy effectiveness, and methods to reduce RIL may improve treatment outcomes. To further develop these approaches for clinical translation, we have proposed 2 specific aims. In aim 1, we will build on our initial prediction model for G4 RIL and leverage our large database of esophageal cancer patients who have completed chemoradiation (CRT) to develop a better predictive model for G4 RIL so that we can rapidly and efficiently identify the highest risk patients for mitigating strategies. In aim 2, we will determine the feasibility and safety of raising the baseline lymphocyte levels by autologous lymphocyte infusion (ALI) prior to initiating CRT. Fundamentally, this research will allow us to develop the necessary computational tool capable of properly identifying patients at risk for developing severe RIL, and complete a small feasibility and safety study of using ALI as a way to raise the baseline pre-treatment lymphocyte levels so that the probability of developing G4 RIL could be possibly curtailed. By targeting the at-risk patients to receive RIL mitigating strategies, we will hopefully be able to improve the cancer outcomes of standard cancer therapies, and build on current innovative strategies of immunotherapy and radiation combinations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Radiation therapy, a key pillar in the management of cancers, causes a common yet ignored side effect of radiation induced lymphopenia (RIL). Severe RIL has been linked to poor outcomes of patients, presumably due to reduced immune surveillance thereby increasing disease recurrence after radiation therapy. We propose developing a prediction model to help identify who are most at risk for developing severe RIL, and conduct a pilot study to help reduce the impact of RIL so that clinical outcomes for these at-risk patients will improve in the future.",Mitigating High Grade Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia through Pretreatment Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion,10017926,R21CA240881,"['Blood Component Removal ',

"Transcriptome-driven inference of adverse drug interactions ABSTRACT Ototoxicity is a debilitating side effect of over 150 medications, many of which are prescribed as part of multi- drug regimens to treat a broad range of conditions including cancer and recalcitrant infections. Adverse drug- drug interactions (DDIs) that potentiate ototoxicity complicate the implementation of multi-drug regimens, particularly to treat multiple concurrent conditions. In most cases, DDIs are currently detected only after the drugs are on the market, so effective preclinical methods to identify potential adverse interactions would facilitate safer co-prescriptions. The astronomical number of combinations renders measuring all possible drug interactions infeasible, so predicting how ototoxic drugs interact from data of individual compounds is necessary. While the current understanding of mechanisms underlying ototoxicity of specific drug classes has helped to explain clinical observations of specific adverse ototoxicity DDIs, and aided rational design of candidate otoprotective adjuvants, this strategy cannot anticipate adverse ototoxicity DDIs or develop otoprotectants for other lesser studied drug classes and first-in-class drugs under clinical development. To survey more broadly for potential ototoxicity DDIs, we will adapt INDIGO (Inferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning tool that currently can predict synergy/antagonism of antimicrobial drug activity in multiple bacterial species without requiring specific drug target information. We hypothesize that we can harness the underlying approach to predict potentially adverse (synergistic) or protective (antagonistic) ototoxic DDIs in humans, by building an “INDIGO-Tox” model based on data generated from an appropriate animal system. We will measure transcriptional profiles elicited by 15 drugs known to convey ototoxicity or otoprotection, as well as corresponding pairwise ototoxicity DDI phenotypes in zebrafish, a well-established in vivo model system for studying ototoxicity. We will use these data to train INDIGO-Tox model. We will then use INDIGO-Tox to predict DDIs between 10 additional drugs, using their zebrafish transcriptome response profiles as input data. We will validate predictions in zebrafish, and will test translation of top validated predictions in a well-established mouse ex vivo model of ototoxicity. We will also use the model to generate predictions for novel genes that influence ototoxicity, which we will then test in zebrafish. Successful completion will generate hypotheses for translation into humans, facilitate model expansion to assessing possible ototoxic interactions for a broader library of drugs, and will establish a path to predict interactions between ototoxicity and other organ toxicities. N AR R AT IVE Drug-induced hearing injury is a debilitating, often irreversible side-effect of certain lifesaving medicines that are often prescribed as part of multi-drug regimens. As adverse drug-drug interactions can exacerbate ototoxicity, novel effective preclinical methods to identify potential interactions would facilitate safer co- prescriptions. Here we propose to develop and validate a computational tool, INDIGO-Tox, to predict ototoxic drug-drug interactions and identify genes that influence these interactions.",Transcriptome-driven inference of adverse drug interactions,9880239,R21DC018341,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Drug Antagonism ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug Synergism ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Genes ', ' Hair Cells ', ' Corti Cell ', ' ear hair cell ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Labyrinth ', ' Internal Ear ', ' inner ear ', ' Larva ', ' Libraries ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Measures ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' ototoxicity ', ' drug induced hearing impairment ', ' drug induced hearing loss ', ' ototoxic ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' anti-microbial agent ', ' anti-microbial drug ', ' antimicrobial agent ', ' antimicrobial drug ', ' System ', ' lateral line ', ' synergism ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' cost ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' loss of function ', ' Regimen ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' model building ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' clinical development ', ' human model ', ' model of human ', ' otoprotectant ', ' otoprotective ', ' side effect ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' pre-clinical assessment ', ' preclinical assessment ', ' ']",NIDCD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,186000
"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability of our immune system to respond effectively to pathogenic challenge or vaccination depends on a diverse repertoire of Immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors expressed by B lymphocytes. Each B cell receptor (BCR) is unique, having been assembled during lymphocyte development by recombination of germline encoded V(D)J genes. During the course of an immune response, B cells that initially bind antigen with low affinity through their BCR are modified through cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity-dependent selection to produce high-affinity memory and plasma cells. This affinity maturation is a critical component of T cell dependent adaptive immune responses. It helps guard against rapidly mutating pathogens and underlies the basis for many vaccines, but dysregulation can result in autoimmunity and other diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our ability to carry out large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) experiments. AIRR-Seq is increasingly being applied to profile BCR repertoires and gain insights into immune responses in healthy individuals and those with a range of diseases, including autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As NGS technologies improve, these experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens- to hundreds-of-millions of BCR sequences. Although promising, repertoire-scale data present fundamental challenges for analysis requiring the development of new techniques and the rethinking of existing methods that are not scalable to the large number of sequences being generated. This proposal describes the development of a series of novel computational methods to explore the central hypothesis that: B cell clonal relationships and lineage structures can be computationally derived from repertoire sequencing data and used to define B cell migration and differentiation networks in health and disease. Specifically, computational methods will be developed to: (Aim 1) identify clonally-related sequences and improve V(D)J gene assignment through determining the Ig locus haplotype, (Aim 2) reconstruct clonal lineages, and use these to learn B cell migration and differentiation networks, and (Aim 3) analyze sequences to predict repertoire properties and sequence motifs that are associated with antigen binding or clinically-relevant outcomes. These through human a combination of simulation-based studies, as (myasthenia gravis) and murine (endogenous methods will be validated well as testing on new experimental data from both retrovirus emergence) systems. Allmethods will be integrated and made available through our widely-used, open-source Immcantation framework, which provides a start-to-finish analytical ecosystem for AIRR-Seq analysis. Together, these methods provide a window into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immunity and the dysregulation that occurs in disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate computational methods to analyze large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) data sets that have become possible with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. The methods development will enable the extraction of new types of information, including immunoglobulin locus haplotypes, as well as B cell migration and differentiation networks. Through quantitative characterization of B cell immunoglobulin repertoires, these methods will provide insights into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immune responses to infection and vaccination, and the dysregulation that occurs in diseases like autoimmunity.",COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING

"Nuclear Organization and Function PROJECT SUMMARY. Proper regulation of gene expression is essential for cell differentiation and homeostasis. Most of our understanding of the mechanisms that control the transcription process comes from studies of the one-dimensional genome i.e. the 10 nm chromatin fiber. However, the genome is folded in the three-dimensional (3D) nuclear space, and the relationship between this organization and gene expression is poorly understood. Using Drosophila as a model system, where it is feasible to obtain 250 bp resolution Hi-C data, we have found that the genome is folded into only one type of domain, which we call compartmental domains. These domains precisely correlate with the transcriptional state of their sequences. Compartmental domains are also found in other lower eukaryotes. Based on this, we propose that compartmental domains represent an evolutionarily conserved principle of genome 3D organization. Drosophila and lower eukaryotes either lack CTCF or this protein is unable to stop cohesin extrusion. However, CTCF can interfere with the progression of cohesin extrusion in vertebrates, which in turn affects other types of interactions in the genome. Here we suggest extending concepts learned from the analysis of 3D organization in Drosophila to mammals by proposing an ambitious and substantive multi-disciplinary approach combining genetics, epigenomics, computational biology, and differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) into disease-relevant tissues. The hypothesis underlying the proposed experiments is based on the idea that, rather than the prevalent view of large compartments containing smaller TADs, the mammalian genome is organized by conserved principles into relatively small compartmental domains. Cohesin extrusion operates on top of the compartmental domain scaffold and affects its organization. To test this novel hypothesis, we will deplete specific proteins present in complexes required for various aspects of the transcription process. We will also deplete protein complexes responsible for H3K27me3- and H3K9me3-dependent silencing. We will then use Micro-C XL to obtain very high-resolution interaction data and examine effects of protein depletion on the formation of self-interacting domains and in the interactions between these domains. These effects will be examined in the presence and absence of cohesin in order to understand the contribution of loop extrusion to enhancer-promoter interaction frequency. We will examine the predictability of 3D genome organization from one-dimensional epigenetic information using machine learning computational tools. We will study the logic of CTCF loop formation by analyzing the local chromatin environment around CTCF sites able or unable to form loops of different strengths using a new computational tool we have developed. Principles learned from these experiments will be tested by analyzing changes in 3D organization and their relationship to gene expression during the differentiation of hESCs into pancreatic cells. Results from this work will fill critical gaps in our understanding of the relationship between 3D chromatin organization and transcription, and its possible role in human disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will analyze the mechanisms by which the three-dimensional organization of the genetic material in the nucleus is established and maintained. This organization is critical for the regulation of gene expression, and the results will be important to understand how transcription is controlled during stem cell differentiation or during reprograming of somatic cells. This knowledge will be essential to understand the basic biology of the cell nucleus and the origin of human genetic disease or cancer and could help guide the use of stem cell therapy to treat human diseases.",Nuclear Organization and Function,10083368,R35GM139408,"['Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genome ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Logic ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Work ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Genetic ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Genetic Materials ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Nuclear ', ' novel ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' stem cell based therapy ', ' stem cell mediated therapy ', ' stem cell therapeutics ', ' stem cell treatment ', ' stem cell-based treatment ', ' stem cell therapy ', ' cohesin ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' hESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' human ESC ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' protein complex ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromatin Fiber ', ' 30 nm Chromatin Fiber ', ' 30 nm Fiber ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Transcription Process ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' epigenomics ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' mammalian genome ', ' human disease ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Hi-C ', ' ']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,431097
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10080700,U19AI135972,"['Animals ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', '

"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,10153763,K08DK115891,"['Affect ', ' Award ', '

"New Methods and Tools for Computational Drug Discovery Project Summary  My goal is to develop effective and efﬁcient computational methods for drug discovery, apply these methods to ﬁnd new and efﬁcacious drugs to treat diseases, and deploy these methods in easy-to-use open source tools. My research group pioneered the development and integration of deep neural networks in user-friendly molecular docking software for structure-based drug design to predict poses and potency of small molecules binding to their molecular targets. We will build on our foundational work by using deep learning to simultaneously solving the scoring and sampling problems, which will overcome scalability limitations inherent in current approaches.  We propose to develop the ﬁrst deep generative models for structure-based drug design. Unlike tra- ditional screening, generative modeling is not limited to a predeﬁned chemical space. In generative mod- eling, a deep neural network learns an underlying distribution of molecular structures and properties represented as a latent space. New structures can be extracted from this learned latent space to have desirable properties. Ideally, a generative model will produce novel, near-optimal molecular structures almost instantaneously. We hypothesize that training generative models using existing 3D protein and ligand structures will allow us to create general models that can be productively applied to new, struc- turally enabled targets due to the richness and universality of protein-ligand interactions. We will further develop these methods to support the generation of optimized lead candidates, where the generative process is updated to include results from experimental assays as the drug discovery process progresses.  We will continually apply our methods to identify small molecule modulators of molecular interac- tions relevant to normal physiology and disease. For example, using our current tools, we identiﬁed the ﬁrst inhibitors of the proﬁlin-actin interaction, an anti-angiogenesis target with relevance to cancer and diabetic retinopathy, and we plan to further improve these compounds with the goal of identifying candi- dates for clinical testing. We will apply our methods to address other under-explored molecular targets, such as NFATc2, which is implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases. These prospective applications of our methods will provide unbiased and realistic evaluations that further inform their development.  Finally, all of our code and trained deep neural network models will be deployed either as new tools for generative modeling or as enhancements to our widely used open source tools for computational drug discovery: (1) PHARMIT, an interactive web application for structure-based drug discovery; (2) GNINA, a C/C++ deep learning framework for molecular docking; and (3) the newly released LIBMOLGRID, a Python library for accelerated molecular gridding that integrates with popular deep learning toolkits. These tools and methods will make the drug discovery process more accessible and efﬁcient. Project Narrative  The research supported by this award will develop new computational methods and tools for drug discovery so that novel therapeutics can be discovered more quickly and with less expense. The de- veloped methods will be evaluated prospectively in drug discovery projects of high relevance to human health.

"SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human organ systems require temporally and spatially coordinated multicellular actions at a macroscale to actuate, sustain, or terminate dedicated and vital functions. Cells that comprise discrete or distributed physiologic systems that fail to respond to appropriate stimuli with coordination may cause significant morbidity and often mortality. Collective and coordinated physiologic activities typically involve millions to billions of cells that may span large physical distances. Technologies for quantifying the electrical, chemical, and mechanical coupling in these multicellular systems are critically important to understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease and develop therapeutic approaches. However, no technology currently exists to quantify rapid mechanical cell responses to transmitted distal perturbations for all cells within a collection of cells. This multi- PI proposal (Chiou (contact PI) and Teitell) aims to develop a new platform imaging technology called SPOT (single pixel optical technology) for concurrent and direct measurements of cellular traction forces over a 1.0 x 1.0 cm2 field of view (FOV) with cellular spatial resolution, and a 1,000 frames/sec temporal resolution. SPOT provides a 4-order of magnitude larger FOV than conventional traction force microscopy. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) are the test bed here because of a high potential for impact in cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in the Western World. We will demonstrate the ability for SPOT to determine quantitative indices of abnormalities for human CM contraction and relaxation in healthy and diseased states. We will establish proof of concept studies in SPOT screens for small molecules that augment or affect CM contraction in desmoplakin deficient states. We will build a platform that integrates SPOT for direct contraction force measurements and Optical Mapping for electrical property measurements for sheets of CMs. This will enable, for the first time, studies of temporal and spatial electromechanical coupling behaviors for sheets of CMs at single cell resolution. We will distinguish different subtypes of CMs, their distributions, their interactions, and their phenotypic responses under external perturbations. And we will apply this platform to investigate the structural and electromechanical coupling properties of hESC-derived CMs by integrating quantitative biomass and stiffness data measured using non-invasive live cell interferometry (LCI). Changes in biomass and cell stiffness are druggable biophysical parameters with correlates to mechanical contraction/relaxation cycles of CMs. In addition to detailed studies of CMs that have the potential to impact the number one killer of US citizens, SPOT applications should have utility and provide new insights in additional settings that require cell or tissue traction-force generation.

"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,10149900,R01AG066883,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' NSCLC ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Gold ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Target Populations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Adjuvant Chemotherapy ', ' Adjuvant Drug Therapy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Sample Size ', ' SEER Program ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' chemoradiation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Esophageal Cancer ', ' Esophagus Cancer ', ' Malignant Esophageal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Esophageal Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Esophagus ', ' oesophageal cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of esophagus ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' disease registry ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Characteristics ', ' Resected ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' safety study ', ' health economics ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' clinical practice ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' Therapy trial ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' treatment group ', ' study population ', ' Chemotherapy and/or radiation ', ' Chemotherapy and Radiation ', ' multiple data sources ', ' treatment comparison ', ' compare treatment ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' clinical trial analysis ', ' esophageal cancer patient ', ' ']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2021,391243
"An Integrative Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Decision Tree Based Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in life sciences and technology, the amount of money spent developing a single drug has stayed drastically expensive. Overall efficiencies have caused drug development to stay the same, with an average cost of $2.6 billion and 15 years to develop a single drug. Considering these challenges, there is an increased need for drug repositioning, in which new indications are found for existing or unapproved drugs. Here we introduce an approach that integrates only drug similarity metrics, such as side effect, structure, and target similarities, to identify novel indications for drugs. By focusing on drug similarity metrics, our proposed method allows for applications towards orphan molecules that presently have no primary indication. To improve upon the current methods of drug repurposing, we propose the developing of a computational approach that utilizes multiple data types within a machine-learning framework in order to predict indications a drug may treat. Based on the observations that similar drugs are used for similar indications, this method utilizes publicly available databases to identify associations between drugs, and integrates drug similarity data, as well as drug-target specific information, into a machine-learning framework in order to accurately predict indications for these drugs. Altogether, our method provides a novel, broadly applicable strategy that can identify novel indications, allowing for an accelerated and more efficient method for future drug development and repositioning efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bringing a drug to market requires an enormous amount of time and money, so our proposed research is designed to address this unmet need to streamline the drug discovery process.

"Statistical Methods for Ultrahigh-dimensional Biomedical Data This proposal develops novel statistics and machine learning methods for distributed analysis of big data in biomedical studies and precision medicine and for selecting a small group of molecules that are associated with biological and clinical outcomes from high-throughput data such as microarray, proteomic, and next generation sequence from biomedical research, especially for autism studies and Alzheimer’s disease research. It focuses on developing efficient distributed statistical methods for Big Data computing, storage, and communication, and for solving distributed health data collected at different locations that are hard to aggregate in meta-analysis due to privacy and ownership concerns. It develops both computationally and statistically efficient methods and valid statistical tools for exploring heterogeneity of big data in precision medicine, for studying associations of genomics and genetic information with clinical and biological outcomes, and for feature selection and model building in presence of errors-in- variables, endogeneity, and heavy-tail error distributions, and for predicting clinical outcomes and understanding molecular mechanisms. It introduces more robust and powerful statistical tests for selection of significant genes, SNPs, and proteins in presence of dependence of data, valid control of false discovery rate for dependent test statistics, and evaluation of treatment effects on a group of molecules. The strength and weakness of each proposed method will be critically analyzed via theoretical investigations and simulation studies. Related software will be developed for free dissemination. Data sets from ongoing autism research, Alzheimer’s disease, and other biomedical studies will be analyzed by using the newly developed methods and the results will be further biologically confirmed and investigated.

"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,10092924,R21AI144433,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Antibodies ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Canine Species ', ' Dogs ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' canine ', ' domestic dog ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hemagglutinin ', ' Equus caballus ', ' Domestic Horse ', ' Equine ', ' Equine Species ', ' Equus przewalskii ', ' Horses ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune Sera ', ' Antisera ', ' immune serum ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' flu vaccine ', ' flu virus vaccine ', ' vaccine against flu ', ' vaccine against influenza ', ' Learning ', ' Lectin ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Avian Influenza A Virus ', ' Avian Influenza Virus ', ' Avian Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Fowl Plague Virus ', ' Myxovirus pestis galli ', ' avian flu virus ', ' bird flu virus ', ' Play ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Domestic Fowls ', ' Poultry ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sea ', ' Sialic Acids ', ' N-Acetylneuraminic Acids ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Trees ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Zoonoses ', ' Zoonotic ', ' Zoonotic Infection ', ' Streptavidin ', ' Strepavidin ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Tropism ', ' swine influenza ', ' porcine influenza ', ' wild bird ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Slide ', ' microorganism ', ' respiratory ', ' protein bound carbohydrate ', ' carbohydrate receptor ', ' carbohydrate structure ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' receptor bound ', ' receptor binding ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Influenza A ', ' Influenza Viruses Type A ', ' Influenzavirus A ', ' Orthomyxovirus Type A ', ' Type A Influenza ', ' Influenza A virus ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' tissue tropism ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype ', ' H3N2 ', ' H3N2 Virus ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Influenza prevention ', ' flu prevention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' flu transmission ', ' influenza transmission ', ' transmission of the flu virus ', ' pathogen ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' viral transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' universal influenza vaccine ', ' universal flu vaccine ', ' universal influenza virus vaccine ', ' universal vaccine against flu ', ' universal vaccine against influenza ', ' multi-task learning ', ' multitask learning ', ' in silico ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' flu virus infection ', ' infected with flu ', ' infected with flu virus ', ' infected with influenza ', ' infected with influenza virus ', ' influenza virus infection ', ' rapid test ', ' rapid assay ', ' rapid tests ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2021,199831
"Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response. PROJECT SUMMARY Precision oncology relies on the hypothesis that further characterizing a patient's tumor will lead to better predictions of treatment response. While this approach effectively breaks diagnoses into smaller and smaller subtypes likely to respond to a given targeted inhibitor, the downside is it results in highly fragmented clinical data spread across multiple treatment arms. The more progress the field makes in assigning new therapies, the harder it will be to accrue adequate sample size to test another therapy. Direct screening of cancer cell lines and primary samples on panels of targeted inhibitors is a uniquely promising approach to this problem, turning every patient sample into a hundred mini experiments, but clinical validation of in vitro drug-response predictions have been hampered by limited numbers of patients who are screened and actually treated with any given drug. Such an evaluation is critical to determine the predictive value gained from drug screening of patient samples. Over the past seven years the Knight Cancer Institute has performed drug screening paired alongside genomic and/or RNA sequencing for over 600 primary leukemic samples. Within two years, we will have accumulated over 200 patients not only screened for in vitro drug response but then treated with matched targeted inhibitors. I will leverage this existing and growing dataset to interrogate the power of in vitro drug screening data to predict clinical response using retrospective data. I will establish a robust framework for primary drug screening and analysis, build interpretable models for clinical decision making, and explore mechanisms controlling drug response. This project will result in improvements to high-throughput drug screening, a thorough accounting of the predictive power of in vitro drug screening, and candidates for treatment combinations in resistant tumors. My goal is to become an independent investigator and cross-disciplinary leader in patient sample multi-omic profiling, targeted therapy selection, and translational oncology. During my mentored phase I will be receiving guidance from Dr. Emek Demir, an expert in computational modeling of systems biology, Dr. Jeffery Tyner, a leader in patient sample drug screening and validation, and Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer of targeted cancer therapy and director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will also improve my statistical understanding of complex systems by working with my advisory committee member Dr Tomi Mori, learn to integrate large datasets and predicting patient outcomes from Dr. Shannon McWeeney, and improve upon existing drug screening platforms and analysis methods with Dr. Laura Heiser. I am determined to attain an independent faculty position and my mentors have committed to assisting me in the application and transition process. PROJECT NARRATIVE A promising field of cancer treatment is targeted therapy, where each patient is prescribed different drugs precisely based on the features of their cancer. We have a large dataset of patients where we tested drugs on their cancer cells in the lab, and later the patient received the same drug as part of their therapy. I will investigate the best methods for testing drugs on each patient's cancer, how effective these tests are for predicting how well a treatment will work in each patient, and why some patients don't

We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, damage and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies visual field loss. However, a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous and it represents a family of age-related disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic networks. We propose to continue to use the BXD (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J) family of recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice as a genetic reference panel (GRP) and to combine our work with human genome wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover and clarify the genetic heterogeneity that underlies optic nerve (ON) damage. We have had recent success using this combined approach in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). We are very well positioned to take the next step and apply this approach to define cellular targets of RGC damage and death. We propose to uncover phenotypic diversities of glaucoma-related ON damage and uncover common underlying mechanisms that are shared with IOP modulation. Our long-term research goal is to identify disease mechanisms and develop neuroprotective therapies to preserve retinal health in patients at risk for glaucoma. Our overall objective is to identify novel gene products and related mechanisms that lead to glaucomatous endophenotypes using multi-dimensional genetic analyses, cross-species comparisons (mouse, rat and human) and validation using novel murine glaucoma models. Our central hypothesis is that molecular processes leading to glaucoma associated-endophenotypes, such as elevated IOP and ON damage, are shared across species, and that species comparisons can uncover common underlying mechanisms, and efficient testing of targeted glaucoma therapeutics. In the current investigation, we perform a systematic analysis of ON damage, and an additional species—rat. We will mine the extensive databases of IOP and ON damage that we are generating for more than 70 BXD strains across five age cohorts with the goal of defining new models of glaucoma. An overall strength of this proposal is the combination of cutting-edge systems genetics methods, species comparisons of glaucoma phenotypes, and a strong interdisciplinary team that includes investigators with extensive experience in systems genetics, glaucoma, GWAS in human and rats, and advanced computational methods. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following thress studies: 1) Identify the candidate gene on chromosome 12 that modulates ON damage; 2) Determine if modulation of IOP and/or ON damage is shared across rodent species; and 3) Identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models through a comprehensive analysis of our enlarged BXD GRP of 100 or more BXD strains. The outcomes of these studies will define novel genes and molecular networks that underlie glaucoma-associated phenotypes and also provide unique glaucoma models for future analysis. These results are expected to fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development.

"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood

"Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction Abstract The success of genome sequencing over the last four decades has resulted in a rapidly increasing gap between the number of known protein sequences and the number of known protein structures and functions. Because protein sequence on its own cannot tell us what each molecule does in cells, the large-scale absence of protein structure and function information severely hinders the progress of contemporary biological and medical studies. These gaps in understanding strongly call for efficient computational approaches for automated, yet highly accurate protein structure prediction and function annotation. The PI’s lab has a successful track record in developing and disseminating high-quality structural bioinformatics methods which have been widely used by the global community. In this project, the lab seeks to develop new advanced methods for both tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. Built on the tools and databases previously developed in the PI’s lab, new deep neural-network based techniques will be extended to residue-level intra- and inter-chain contact- and distance-map predictions. These predictions will then be used to constrain the conformational searching space of threading-based fragment assembly simulations, with the aim to significantly improve the accuracy and success rate of structure modeling of monomeric proteins and protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially for the difficult targets that lack homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank. Next, the structure and PPI network information will be used to help elucidate multiple levels of biological and biomedical functions for protein molecules, including mutation-induced changes in protein stability and human disease predictions. The long- term goals of this project are to significantly improve the state of the art of protein structure prediction and to narrow the gap between the abundance of protein sequence information and the dearth of protein structure and function data, thus significantly enhancing the usefulness and impact of structural bioinformatics. Success in this project will also help reveal the general principles governing the fundamental relations across sequence, structure and function of protein molecules. Relevance Researchers in contemporary drug industry need to use the knowledge of 3-dimensional structure of protein molecules for designing synthetic compounds to fight against human diseases. But many pharmaceutically important proteins do not have experimentally solved structures. This project seeks to develop advanced computer methods for high-quality protein structure prediction that can be used to function annotation and compound screening; these should have an important and general impact on drug discovery and human health.",Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction,10132358,R35GM136422,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Drug Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Networks ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' AGRP protein ', ' agouti-related protein ', ' ART protein ', ' protein structure function ', ' success ', ' Quaternary Protein Structure ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Induced DNA Alteration ', ' Induced Sequence Alteration ', ' Induced Mutation ', ' protein function ', ' fight against ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' Network-based ', ' human disease ', ' screening ', ' Structural Protein ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' protein data bank ', ' protein databank ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2021,514097
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics.

"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America. The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) project will provide a nimble and flexible network of surveillance sites in Central and South America coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter these threats to public health.",Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO),10170251,U01AI151807,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Americas ', ' Animals ', ' Arbovirus Infections ', ' Arboviral infections ', ' Arthropod-Born Viral Infection ', ' arboviral disease ', ' arbovirus disease ', ' arthropod-borne disease ', ' arthropod-borne infection ', ' arthropodborne disease ', ' arthropodborne infection ', ' Arboviruses ', ' Arboviral ', ' Arthropod-Borne Viruses ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Brazil ', ' Central America ', ' chikungunya ', ' Chikungunya virus ', ' CHIKV ', ' Cities ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Dengue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Invertebrates ', ' Invertebrata ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Maps ', ' Measles ', ' Rubeola ', ' morbilli ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Panama ', ' Public Health ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' South America ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Vaccination ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Venezuela ', ' Virus ', ' West Nile virus ', ' Egypt 101 virus ', ' WNV ', ' West Nile ', ' Yellow Fever ', ' Zoonoses ', ' Zoonotic ', ' Zoonotic Infection ', ' Deforestation ', ' forest clearing ', ' Mediating ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Biodiversity ', ' Biological Diversity ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Route ', ' experience ', ' enzootic ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Habitats ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Collection ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Vector-transmitted infectious disease ', ' Vector-borne disease ', ' Vector-borne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted disease ', ' vector-borne illness ', ' vectorborne disease ', ' vectorborne illness ', ' vectorborne infectious disease ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' climate change ', ' global climate change ', ' pathogen ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' high risk ', ' surveillance network ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' nanobodies ', ' nanobody ', ' sdAb ', ' single domain antibodies ', ' seroconversion ', ' Zika Virus ', ' ZIKV ', ' zikav ', ' viral transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' ZIKA ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' emerging pathogen ', ' new pathogen ', ' novel pathogen ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,U01,2021,1519214
"Methods for determination of glycoprotein glycosylation similarities among disease states Abstract This application addresses NIGMS PAR-17-045 “Focused Technology Research and Development (R01)”. This initiative supports projects that focus solely on development of technologies with the potential to enable biomedical research. Dysregulation of the cellular microenvironment occurs in cancers, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Known as the matrisome, the set of extracellular matrix and cell surface molecules control the availability of growth factors to cellular receptors and the mechanical-physical properties of the cell microenvironment. Currently, the limited understanding of regulation of matrisome glycosylation hinders understanding of the roles of glycosylation-dependent matrisome networks in the basic mechanisms necessary for targeted intervention of many diseases. Matrisome function depends on networks of interaction among glycosylated proteins and glycan-binding lectins. It is not possible using present proteomics and glycoproteomics methods to compare using rigorous statistics similarities of glycoproteins that differ by disease-related changes in site-specific glycosylation. We propose to develop technologies to meet this need. Present proteomics methods quantify proteins using a few representative peptides per gene product; sequence coverage for most proteins is low. Such low sequence coverage does not suffice to reconstruct the predominant glycosylated proteoforms active in a biological context. We propose to develop technologies to compare glycoprotein similarities among biological sample sets. To do this, we will develop MS acquisition and bioinformatics methods for rapid, sensitive and reproducible mapping of glycoprotein glycosylation to enable statistically rigorous comparison of glycoprotein similarities. By making these technologies available, we will enable a new level of understanding of the roles of matrisome networks in human diseases. Project narrative The matrisome consists of glycosylated extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins that surround cells and support normal physiological activity. While it is known that glycosylation changes during disease processes, it has not been possible to quantitatively compare glycoprotein structure among biological samples.

"Multimodal computational models to stratify ovarian cancer patients Project Summary/Abstract High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with a five-year survival rate of less than 30% for metastatic disease. Our lab has identified mutational processes as predictors of survival and response to therapy, along with a working model to predict homologous recombination deficiency from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) whole-slide images. Our collaborators in diagnostic radiology have discovered robust associations between BRCA mutational status and qualitative features on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT). These two imaging modalities, however, have yet to be combined with genomic information to improve stratification of HGSC patients. Based on these preliminary data, I will test the hypothesis that combined mesoscopic information in CE-CT and microscopic information in H&E can be used to infer known mutational subtypes and also to identify novel patient strata. I have curated a cohort of 118 HGSC patients with matched targeted panel-based genome sequencing, scanned H&E whole-slide images, and segmented pre-treatment CE-CT images for this purpose. In Specific Aim 1, I will develop a machine learning model to integrate CE-CT and H&E imaging to predict mutational subtype from these ubiquitous imaging modalities. In Specific Aim 2, I will develop an end-to-end deep learning model to integrate the complementary information from CE-CT, H&E, and genome sequencing for survival analysis using a Cox Proportional Hazards model. I anticipate that this work will (1) identify refined stratification of HGSC patients using this multimodal prognostic signature and (2) develop a general-purpose machine learning model to integrate CE-CT, H&E, and genomic sequencing for cancer patient survival analysis. This research will be conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center under the mentorship of Dr. Sohrab Shah. The training plan that Dr. Shah and I have developed will prepare me well for a future as a physician- scientist conducting machine learning research for cancer patient prognosis. Project Narrative Mutational subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer stratify patients by clinical outcome, yet genomic sequencing omits spatial information with potential prognostic relevance. In the proposed project, I aim to (1) infer mutational subtype by combining radiologic and histologic imaging and (2) identify refined patient strata by integrating radiologic and histologic imaging with genomic sequencing. Completion of this work will identify new strata of ovarian cancer patients and result in new machine learning models to integrate cancer imaging with genomic sequencing.",Multimodal computational

"SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes Project Summary/Abstract For ovarian cancer (OvCa), only 27% of women diagnosed at advanced stages survive 5 years, yet more than 90% of patients survive when diagnosed at an earlier stage. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new non- invasive technologies capable of rapidly diagnosing ovarian cancers (OvCa) in early stage. Fortuitously, all cells (and tumor cells to a greater extent) expel nanoscale vesicles that are directly reflective of the biological state of their parent cells. A subset of circulating EVs known as exosomes are composed of biomolecules spanning the range of lipids, proteins, genes, and more, and hold great potential for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Yet current methods for phenotyping biofluids according to detection of tumor-associated exosomes (TEXs) are not meeting clinical standards and fail to precisely capture particle to particle heterogeneity. We propose to develop a new nanoplasmonics-based technology for sensitive detection of cancer-related exosome bio-signatures enabled by multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, that we call ExoSERS. Our approach encompasses three aims devised to realize the ExoSERS platform. Aim 1 outlines development of a new class of Raman-active ligands to serve as the molecular barcodes. This aim encompasses the design and synthesis of polyyne-based ligands designed to confer Raman spectroscopic encoding and also initiate a silane coating to form a protecting shell around a nanoplasmonic core. Aim 2 describes the synthesis and optimization of nanoplasmonic core-shell structures that will be well-suited to binding EVs. An inner gold core structure yields plasmonic enhancement, while the outer silica shell permits long-term stability and a convenient surface for covalent decoration with exosome and cancer-specific surface marker targeting agents. Aim 3 comprises validation of the platform’s feasibility to profile human OvCa patient plasma, including machine learning approaches to type cancers using the barcoded approach. Endpoints of platform characterization will be statistical validation of exosome detection efficiency, minimal sample volume needed, ease of utilization, and low cost. Several quantitative milestones have been proposed to gauge our progress and provide deliverables to the larger diagnostic and circulating biomarker communities. Project Narrative All cells dynamically excrete into circulation nano-sized packages called extracellular vesicles (EVs), but this pathway can be hijacked by cancer cells for means of immune system suppression and metastasis. Innovative cross-disciplinary engineering methods are urgently needed to realize the diagnostic application of circulating cancer EVs to improve early detection of diseases like ovarian cancer, which do not have effective early screening tests. This project encompasses the design of highly multiplexed new nanoplasmonic probes for sensitive chemical fingerprinting of targeted circulating EVs, to ultimately improve the limit of detection for diagnosing ovarian cancer compared to conventional methods.",SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes,10145619,R01CA241666,"['Antibodies ', ' Architecture ',

"Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers ABSTRACT  Gynecologic cancers are among the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. These patients typically are socioeconomically disadvantaged, with poor access to screening and vaccination. Consequently, they often present with locoregionally advanced disease, for which pelvic radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent cisplatin (i.e., chemoradiotherapy) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of treatment failure. Intensifying treatment through the delivery of chemotherapy doublets, either concurrently or as adjuvant therapy following chemoradiotherapy, is a promising strategy to improve outcomes. However, the delivery of intensive chemotherapy is complicated by high rates of gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoradiotherapy are needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue including bowel, bone marrow, bone, bladder, and rectum, leading to preventable radiation-induced toxicity. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can improve target localization and dosimetry, optimizing target dose while minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. However, IGRT can be highly resource intensive, and comparative effectiveness trials have been lacking. For this reason, there is considerable controversy as to the utility of IG-IMRT in this disease. Our research group has been at the forefront of developing novel, cost-effective IGRT approaches with wide potential to facilitate better delivery of concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy.  Previously we have found that radiation-induced injury to hematopoietically active bone marrow is a critical determinant of tolerance to intensive chemotherapy. Using machine learning methods, we recently developed a multi-atlas-based IGRT method that can predict canonical distributions of active bone marrow, which can obviate the need for positron emission tomography (PET) in settings where this technology is unavailable or unaffordable. The proposed new research will study the ability of multi-atlas-based IGRT to reduce hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to standard treatment, using data from 450 patients enrolled to a randomized phase III trial (NRG-GY006). Furthermore, we will use serial whole body PET/CT to study the impact of radiation dose and chemotherapy intensity on the compensatory hematopoietic response, and have developed novel whole body radiomics biomarkers to quantify the inflammatory state, which we hypothesize can influence patients' outcomes and tolerance to chemotherapy.  The new research extends our work associated with a current R01 grant (1R01CA197059-01) to conduct correlative science associated with the GY006 trial. The overarching goal of this research line is to augment the therapeutic ratio of chemoradiotherapy for pelvic cancers using advanced image-guided radiation techniques. If successful, this research would significantly alter the approach to the treatment of many pelvic malignancies for which chemoradiotherapy is standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this study, we will test the ability of a novel method called multi-atlas-based image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to reduce acute hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to conventional RT, which could obviate the need for expensive functional imaging in socioeconomically disadvantaged and resource constrained populations, such as patients with gynecologic cancers. In addition, we will use serial positron emission tomography to study effects of chemotherapy and radiation on the subacute compensatory hematopoietic response, and will seek to develop and validate novel whole body radiomics models of the inflammatory state as predictive biomarkers for gynecologic cancers.

"Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist and leader in the field of glaucoma and public health. She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss.

"Machine learning with immunogenetics for the prediction of hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes ABSTRACT Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment for most forms of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), but its 50% failure rate remains unacceptably high, with the principal causes of death due to disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease. When successful, HCT prevents leukemic relapse due to a graft versus leukemia effect, co-mediated by T cell and natural killer (NK) cell immune functions. Selection of donors whose allografts will provide higher NK anti-leukemic response potential but low GVHD risk remains a major unmet need in HCT.  The polygenic, polymorphic KIR receptors, in combination with their HLA ligands, control NK function, dictating NK repertoire content and establishing thresholds for NK cell response in a process called “NK education”. Large retrospective studies in HCT have demonstrated that specific KIR-HLA allele combinations associated with NK education are predictive for relapse control, but they represent only a fraction of known KIR-HLA interactions. Furthermore, out of the thousands of phenotypes present in the NK repertoire, the NK population(s) responsible for leukemia control in HCT is unknown and they likely differ between transplant pairs. Aim 1 proposes a machine learning approach to integrate NK genotype, phenotype, and function to identify how genotype determines overall repertoire response and which subpopulations contribute most to global response. Parallel statistical modeling of NK genotypes and HCT outcome in a cohort of 2800 AML patient may confirm the same genotypes that are potent for global response also play a role in HCT outcomes but may also identify unexpected ones.  HLA is the most important determinant of GVHD risk. Precise HLA matching lowers the risk for GVHD, but for patients who lack HLA-compatible donors, predicting permissible HLA mismatches is a paramount and unmet need. Two lineages of HLA-B allotypes exist based on the M and T leader peptide dimorphism, and GVHD risk in HLA-mismatched HCT differs depending on the match status of the leader. The division of the HLA-B locus into two lineages provides a novel approach for mapping functional motifs in transplantation that removes reduces the sheer numbers of polymorphic positions that previously precluded examination of more than 1 residue at a time. Machine learning approaches using HLA data from more than 11,000 transplant patients will permit assessment of the full spectrum of lineage variation and the relationship between T-cell and NK alloresponses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of the proposed study is to determine how two different immune cells, known as natural killer cells and T cells, work to recognize cancer cells and cause destruction of healthy tissues in patients receiving a bone marrow transplant. Understanding what stimulates these behaviors will help research scientists and physicians to make bone marrow transplants more successful at curing cancer.",Machine learning with immunogenetics for the prediction of hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes,10101252,R01HL155741,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Behavior ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Genotype ', ' graft vs host disease ', ' GvHD ', ' Homologous Wasting Disease ', ' Runt Disease ', ' graft versus host disease ', ' graft vs. host disease ', ' HLA-B Antigens ', ' HLA-B ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunogenetics ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Influentials ', ' Natural Killer Cells ', ' Cytotoxic cell ', ' K lymphocyte ', ' NK Cells ', ' leukemia ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' AML - Acute Myeloid Leukemia ', ' Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' acute granulocytic leukemia ', ' acute myeloid leukemia ', ' Ligands ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Cell Surface Receptors ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' peptide B ', ' proenkephalin peptide B ', ' Mediating ', ' Immunologist ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' NK cell receptor NKB1 ', ' KIR3DL1 ', ' NKB1 receptor ', ' Recurrent disease ', ' Relapsed Disease ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Allografting ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' cohort ', ' GVL ', ' graft versus leukemia ', ' graft vs leukemia ', ' graft vs leukemia response ', ' graft vs. leukemia ', ' graft vs. leukemia effect ', ' graft vs. leukemia response ', ' graft vs leukemia effect ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Leader Peptide ', ' Leader Signal Peptide ', ' Peptide Leader Sequences ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Receptor Gene ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Allogenic ', ' Antitumor Response ', ' anti-tumor response ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Gene Combinations ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dimorphism ', ' T cell response ', ' hematopoietic cell transplantation ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' curative treatments ', ' curative intervention ', ' curative therapeutic ', ' curative therapy ', ' relapse prediction ', ' predict relapse ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' Data Scientist ', ' leukemia relapse ', ' ']",NHLBI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,650223
"Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) plays an increasing role in guidance of interventional radiology (IR) procedures in the abdo- men, with special emphasis in embolization procedures, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or transarterial embolization (TAE) for control of internal hemorrhage. However, relatively long scan time of CBCT results in artifacts arising from organ motion (respiratory and cardiac motion and peristalsis). This poses a significant challenge to guidance in interventional radiology: for example, motion artifacts were found to render up to 25% of CBCT images un-interpretable in image-guided TACE, and 18% in CBCT-guided emergency TAE. The impact of motion is most significant in cases of single or isolated lesions treated with selective embolization that requires visual- ization of very small vascular structures. Existing motion correction methods often invoke assumption of periodicity, lim- iting their applicability outside of cardiac and respiratory motions, or rely on fiducial tracking or gated acquisition that disrupt IR workflow and/or increase radiation dose. Therefore, the application of CBCT in image-guided interventional procedures in the abdomen would significantly benefit from new methods that estimate complex deformable motion directly from image data. “Autofocus” techniques based on maximization of a regularized image sharpness criterion were shown to yield effective patient motion compensation in extremity, head and cardiac CBCT. However, current applications of such methods are limited to rigid motions. We hypothesize that deformable organ motion compensation in interven- tional soft-tissue CBCT can be achieved with advanced autofocus techniques using multiple locally rigid regions of in- terest, preconditioned with basic motion characteristics obtained through a machine learning decision framework. The following aims will be pursued: 1) Develop a joint multi-region autofocus optimization method to compensate deforma- ble organ motion. This includes incorporation into a comprehensive artifacts correction and image reconstruction pipe- line, design of multi-stage optimization schedules for convergence acceleration, and performance evaluation in deforma- ble phantoms, and cadaver and animal experiments. 2) Develop a decision framework for preconditioning of the motion compensation method through a combination of projection-based approaches for physiological signal estimations (res- piratory cycle) and a multi-input, multi-branch, deep learning architecture trained on extremely realistic simulated data that will estimate basic properties of motion (spatial distribution of amplitude, direction, and frequency) from an initial motion-contaminated image and its associated raw projection data. 3) Evaluate deformable motion compensation in animal experiments and in a clinical study in 50 cases of CBCT-guided TACE and assess image quality via expert observer evaluation of satisfaction and utility. The proposed work will yield a robust, practical method for compensation of deform- able soft-tissue motion in CBCT, removing a critical impediment to 3D guidance in IR. The deformable autofocus frame- work will be applicable to other interventions in which soft-tissue motion diminishes CBCT guidance, such as image-guided radiation therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventional Cone Beam CT (CBCT) provides critical 3D information to guide minimally-invasive procedures in the abdomen, but CBCT image quality is often compromised by organ deformation due to breathing, cardiac, and peristaltic motions. We propose a novel framework to mitigate the effects of this complex deformable motion using only the CBCT image data, without a need for gating, external trackers, or fiducial markers. This algorithm will remove a major impediment to 3D guidance in procedures such as transcatheter embolization procedures in the abdomen.",Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology,10100337,R01EB030547,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arteries ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cadaver ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Therapeutic Embolization ', ' Embolization Therapy ', ' Embolotherapy ', ' embolization ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Exhibits ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Fluoroscopy ', ' Head ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Peristalsis ', ' Play ', ' Interventional radiology ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' soft tissue ', ' satisfaction ', ' radiologist ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' respiratory ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' Performance ', ' internal control ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Chemotherapy Embolization ', ' Chemoembolization ', ' Modeling ', ' preconditioning ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Arterial Embolization ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cone-beam computed tomography ', ' cone-beam CT ', ' volume CT ', ' volume computed tomography ', ' volumetric computed tomography ', ' feeding ', ' image guided intervention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prostate Ablation ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' tumor ', ' minimally invasive ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' arm ', ' image guided radiation therapy ', ' IGRT ', ' image guided radiation treatment ', ' image-guided radiotherapy ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Visualization ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,368438
"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,10098302,R01AR073882,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Cadaver ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Genes ', ' Head ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methylation ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Joint structure of shoulder region ', ' Glenohumeral Joint ', ' Shoulder Joint ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Tendons ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Genetic ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Autologous ', ' Techniques ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Supraspinatus ', ' supraspinatus muscle ', ' American ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' Devices ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Mesenchymal Progenitor Cell ', ' Mesenchymal progenitor ', ' Mesenchymal Stem Cells ', ' Mechanical Stimulation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Allogenic ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Engineered Gene ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' spatial relationship ', ' therapeutic target ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' patient population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' regenerative ', ' phenome ', ' phenomics ', ' methylome ', ' epigenome ', ' tendon development ', ' tendon growth ', ' tendon maturation ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' rotator cuff tear ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' mechanical load ', ' mechanical properties ', ' translation to humans ', ' lipidome ', ' ']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,479770
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity.

"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. Biomarkers will also be tested for causality the mouse model. The Administrative Core will perform the outward- facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"Estimating Mediation Effects in Prevention Studies The purpose of this competing continuation grant proposal is to develop, evaluate and apply  methodological and statistical procedures to investigate how prevention programs change outcome  variables. These mediation analyses assess the link between program effects on the constructs targeted  by a prevention program and effects on the outcome. As noted by many researchers and federal  agencies, mediation analyses identify the most effective program components and increase  understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to changing outcome variables. Information from  mediation analysis can make interventions more powerful, more efficient, and shorter. The P. I. of this grant received a one-year NIDA small grant and four multi-year grants to develop and evaluate mediation  analysis in prevention research. This work led to many publications and innovations. The proposed  five-year continuation focuses on the further development and refinement of exciting new mediation  analysis statistical developments. Four statistical topics represent next steps in this research and include  analytical and simulation research as well as applications to etiological and prevention data. The work expands on our development of causal mediation and Bayesian mediation methods that hold great promise for mediation analysis. In Study 1, practical causal mediation and Bayesian mediation analyses  for research designs are developed and evaluated. This approach will clarify methods and develop  approaches for dealing with violation of testable and untestable assumptions. Study 2 investigates  important measurement issues for the investigation of mediation. This work will focus on methods to identify critical facets of mediating variables, approaches to understanding whether mediators and  outcomes are redundant, and develop methods for studies with big data. Study 3 continues the development and evaluation of new longitudinal mediation methods for ecological momentary assessment data and other studies with massive data collection. These new methods promise to more accurately model change over time for both individuals and groups of individuals. Study 4 develops methods to  uncover subgroups in mediation analysis including causal mediation methods, multilevel models, and new  approaches based on residuals for identifying individuals for whom mediating processes differ in  effectiveness from other individuals. For each study, we will investigate unique issues with mediation analysis of prevention data including methods for small N and also massive data collection (big data), the RcErLitEicVaANl rCoEle(Soeef imnsetruacstiounrse):ment for mediating mechanisms, and the application of the growing literature on  causal methods and Bayesian methods.

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10159296,R01GM131491,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gases ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ions ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Smoking ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Stress ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' cohort ', ' validation studies ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Metabolite Interaction ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical effect ', ' interoperability ', ' user-friendly ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' lipidomics ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,376064
"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and

"A novel microfluidic platform to study exosome biology in PAH. The endothelium is the cellular monolayer that covers the inner lining of the entire circulatory system. Endothelial dysfunction is a feature of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a life-threatening disease associated with abnormally high pulmonary pressures and chronic right heart failure. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in PAH remains incomplete. Given that endothelial dysfunction is a common finding in PAH, an understanding of the mechanism behind maladaptive endothelial responses could help accelerate the discovery of novel therapies for PAH. Presently, it is believed that endothelial derived exosomes contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury. Exosomes are cell-derived small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles that carry proteins, metabolites and nucleic acids involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. While it is known that exosomes carry molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity, a comprehensive assessment of exosome cargo of healthy and dysfunctional PMVECs has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques. These techniques cannot perform real-time dynamic exosome isolation from pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) exposed to PAH-associated stressors. To address this unmet need, we have designed the MFES (Multifunctional Exosome Sorter) that can dissect the whole exosome population into subpopulations based on size and surface markers. MFES is the first lab-on-a-chip platform that integrates: 1) a vessel-on-a-chip module for real-time characterization of PMVEC functional responses across a wide range of physiological and pathological parameters, 2) a module for high-yield exosome size-based isolation, 3) a surface marker based exosome sorting using magnetic beads, and 4) multi-omics phenotyping of exosomes of PMVECs. Here, we are proposing a technology that can enable broadly to investigate the two main defining characteristics of exosomal subtypes, i.e., size and surface markers, both separately independently, and in combination sequentially. We will characterize changes in exosome cargo in healthy and PAH PMVECs exposed to shear stress-related conditions in the MFES. We will isolate subpopulations of exosomes based on size and surface markers and characterize them for their cargo (Aim 1). Then, we will determine whether exosomes derived from stressed PMVECs can induce pathological changes in healthy PMVECs cultured in a microfluidic culture chip (Aim 2). This technological innovation enables to study endothelial exosome biology in a setting that represents the flow dynamics associated with PAH. Further, the use of cutting-edge -omics technologies, bioinformatic analysis integrated with machine learning algorithms to analyze the purified exosomes is expected to yield a comprehensive dataset of exosome cargo profiles and open exciting opportunities for investigating the biological role of exosomes in PAH pathobiology and the testing of novel therapeutic agents. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains incomplete.

"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,10137892,R01AR074453,"['Algorithms ', ' bone ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' arthropathies ', ' Joint Diseases ', ' arthropathic ', ' arthropathy ', ' joint disorder ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee joint ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Musculoskeletal System ', ' locomotor system ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Arthroplasty ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' joint arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' knee OA ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Measurable ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' information model ', ' clinical risk ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' automated analysis ', ' feature extraction ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' prognostic model ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,482108
"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology.

"the Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS-CDTR) Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes mellitus is a significant health burden in the U.S. and California leads the nation in incident cases and costs of Type 2 Diabetes. Individuals with low socioeconomic status, older adults, rural populations, and racial and ethnic minorities are at highest risk. The drivers of these disparities include a complex combination of interacting factors at the individual, family, community, health system, societal, and policy levels. Programs and policies that can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes interventions into widespread practice across diverse communities, modes of delivery, and a range of settings are desperately needed. The Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS-CDTR) aims to advance health equity science through the development and translation of: 1) innovations and structural changes to healthcare delivery systems that substantively reduce health inequalities, and 2) innovative, scalable interventions to alter the socioenvironmental drivers of the Type 2 Diabetes epidemic and associated disparities. Focusing on the northern California and Central Valley regions of California, the DREAMS-CDTR will conduct clinical research and interventions designed to inform practice and policy change at the health system, community and policy levels. The DREAMS-CDTR (formerly Health Delivery Systems) brings together translational science core faculty who have expertise in diverse, multi-level areas including: food insecurity, medication adherence, health communication, health IT, social policy, and cost effectiveness analysis. DREAMS-CDTR will involve four regional academic sites with a range of public and non-profit health systems that serve large and diverse populations: Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s Division of Research and the University of California at San Francisco, Merced and Davis. The DREAMS-CDTR activities include: an Administrative Core, Pilot and Feasibility Program, Enrichment Program, and three coordinated research cores - Health Equity & Action Translational (HEAT) core, Methods and Data Integration (MDI) translational core, and National Diabetes Policy Research Resource (DPR) core. The HEAT Core will employ a multi-level systems approach to designing rigorous action-oriented observational and interventional research. The MDI Core will systematically prepare and support DREAMS-CDTR members in harnessing novel advances in methods and data to achieve greater health equity in Type 2 Diabetes. Lastly, the novel National DPR Core will extend the reach of the DREAMS-CDTR expertise and resources beyond the primary institutions in five key areas of expertise: (1) natural experiments research,(2) health economics, including comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis; (3) simulation modeling, (4) machine learning, and (5) communicating science to policy-making institutions, community partners, health departments, and human service organizations. Narrative The purpose of this renewal application is to continue and refocus the work of the Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research (HDS-CDTR) (P30 DK092924), renamed the Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS- CDTR), on reducing diabetes related health disparities and improving health equity. Refocused on northern California and its Central Valley, the DREAMS-CDTR is a collaborative partnership between the Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s Division of Research and the University of California at San Francisco, Merced and Davis.

"Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development Abstract Human craniofacial development is a complex process and frequently goes awry to cause a major class of birth defects, orofacial clefting, which affects approximately 1 in 700 live births. Proper facial development in mouse and human requires three sets of paired facial prominences coming together by growth, morphogenesis, and fusion. Embryonic facial development is strikingly similar in human and mouse, making the mouse the best available model system for human. Previous studies have shown that the expression of many thousands of genes changes across tissue layer, age, and/or prominence, as well as cell population during early mouse facial development. However, we still only have a rudimentary understanding of how these changes are regulated by the interaction of transcriptional modulators in the developing face. To understand how genes are transcriptionally regulated during facial development, this research seeks to construct transcriptional regulatory networks in a temporospatial manner by in silico analysis of publicly available multi- omic datasets. Aim 1 will focus on the identification and verification of transcriptional regulatory networks operating in facial mesenchyme with a focus on super-enhancers. Aim 2 will adopt a similar approach to study the ectoderm which acts as a vital signaling center for the mesenchyme. Finally, in Aim 3 I will apply knowledge from Aims 1 and 2 to build transcriptional regulatory networks at the single cell level. These aims will take advantage of available RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, histone marker ChIP-seq, transcription factor ChIP-seq, bulk and single cell RNA-seq data from wild-type or mutant mice, as well as facial enhancer expression databases. Accomplishment of these studies will predict how genes are transcriptionally regulated in a temporospatial manner during facial development and discover sets of core transcription factors and super- enhancers controlling facial development. These transcriptional regulatory networks will be relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of human orofacial clefting, and will provide clear testable predictions about transcription factor function and the consequences of aberrant expression. Performance and accomplishment of these Aims will also act as a major component of my career development plan, in which my goal is to obtain and independent tenure-track faculty position and serve as a mentor to the next generation of scientists. A major aspect of my career development plan is to build on my growing strength in bioinformatics by learning more advanced techniques in this specialty alongside new computational based approaches, such as machine learning. In this respect, my Aims and career development plan are aligned with a Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) of NIDCR in Supporting Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research Using Bioinformatic, Computational, and Data Science Approaches (NOT-DE-20-006) for which this application is targeted. I have recruited a mentorship team with specialties in craniofacial biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and career development to help me achieve these goals. Project Narrative Human craniofacial development is a complex process and requires suites of genes to be switched on and off at appropriate times and spaces during formation of the embryo. There is now a wealth of data available in public databases concerning which genes are expressed when and where during mammalian facial development, including for the transcription factors which are the proteins that regulate these critical expression programs, but we have not yet begun to connect this information together to derive logical predictions about the critical networks responsible for craniofacial development. This proposal will address that gap using both computational and laboratory-based methods to derive and verify transcriptional regulatory networks relevant to the genetic and molecular underpinnings of normal facial development as well as how these are disrupted to cause defects such as human orofacial clefting.",Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Craniofacial Development,10284443,K01DE030923,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' bone ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Ectoderm ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Histones ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mutant Strains Mice ', ' mouse mutant ', ' Study models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Pathology ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Mesenchyme ', ' Mesenchymas ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Solid ', ' Dental ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Oral ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Live Birth ', ' interest ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' Performance ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Validation ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Computational Science ', ' Population ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' critical period ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' FaceBase ', ' craniofacial development ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' Data Science ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' recruit ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K01,2021,130135
"Developing new computational tools for spatial transcriptomics data Project Summary  Spatial transcriptomics is a groundbreaking new technology that allows measurement of gene ac- tivity in a tissue sample while mapping where the activity is occurring. It holds the promise to facilitate our understanding of spatial heterogeneity underlying essential phenotypes and diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. However, the development of bioinformatics infrastructures and computational tools has fallen seriously behind the technological advances. The lack of proper computational approaches presents current data analysis barriers that signiﬁcantly hinder biological investigations. The overarching goal of this proposal is to address some of the most pressing ana- lytic challenges facing proﬁling and interpreting spatial transcriptomics data, including 1) lack of robust identiﬁcation of genes with spatial expression patterns across a variety of technical platforms, 2) lack of tools to identify structures, microenvironments as well as developmental trajectory on the tissue, and 3) lack of tools that can jointly analyze spatial transcriptomic data across multiple samples and multiple data sources. In the proposal, we will work on the following aims: Aim 1. Develop nonpara- metric tools for identifying genes with spatial expression patterns. Aim 2. Develop spatially aware dimension reduction tools for detecting structures and developmental trajectories on the tissue. Aim 3. Develop integrative association tools for spatial transcriptomic analysis across multiple samples and datasets. All the methods will be implemented in user-friendly software and disseminated to the sci- entiﬁc community. Successful achievement of all aims will dramatically increase the power of spatial transcriptomics analysis, and facilitate the application of these cutting-edge technologies to transla- tional and clinical studies. Project Narrative  Spatial transcriptomics is a groundbreaking new technology that allows measurement of gene ac- tivity in a tissue sample while mapping where the activity is occurring.

"Symmetry Breaking and Collective Cell Growth in Drosophila Oogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY In many studied animal species, including mammals, the future oocyte develops within a cluster of cells that exchange molecules and organelles through a network of cytoplasmic bridges, which are formed by stabilized and reinforced cytokinetic furrows. While the formation and structure of this interesting class of multicellular systems has been extensively studied, their dynamics is poorly understood, leaving many critical questions about oocyte determination and development unanswered. I will investigate two of these questions in Drosophila, an experimental model that continues to provide valuable insights into general mechanisms of animal oogenesis. Using experimental, modeling, and computational approaches, I will investigate how one cell within the germline cell cluster is chosen to be the future oocyte and how the germline cell cluster comprising the oocyte and supporting nurse cells grows during development. Specifically, Aim 1 is designed to evaluate the differential contributions of the prepatterning and self-organizing mechanisms of oocyte determination. Focusing on the fusome, a membranous structure that is essential for intercellular communication in early oogenesis, and on a recently discovered positive feedback loop involving mRNA localization and translation, I will establish data- driven mathematical models for oocyte selection. In parallel, Aim 2 will investigate growth of the oocyte and supporting cells, using the germline cluster as a tractable system for exploring how the scaling laws established by studies of single cell growth are altered when cells grow together. In particular, I will focus on size regulation of nuclei and nucleoli, aiming to understand how their sizes adjust to rapidly increasing cell volumes within the germline cell cluster. The completion of these proposed studies, which are supported by strong preliminary results, including a machine learning approach for 3D image reconstructions and morphometric analysis, should provide new insights into some of the first steps of animal oogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new quantitative approaches for studies of oocyte specification and collective cell size regulation during Drosophila oogenesis, an experimental system that continues to reveal highly conserved mechanisms of female germline development and provides unique opportunities for the integration of genetic, imaging, and computational techniques.",Symmetry Breaking and Collective Cell Growth in Drosophila Oogenesis,10285981,F31HD098835,"['Animals ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cyst ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Techniques ', ' Genetic Technics ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Laws ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Manuals ', ' Study models ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Oocytes ', ' Ovocytes ', ' Oogenesis ', ' Organelles ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' insight ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' Cell Volumes ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Cell to Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell-Cell Signaling ', ' intercellular communication ', ' Regulation of Cell Size ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Supporting Cell ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' egg ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' imaging study ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,39636
"Radiation-specific Automated Dental Dose Distributions via Machine-learning based Mapping for Accurate Predictions of (Peri)odontal Problems (RADMAP) PROJECT SUMMARY Oral cavity and oropharyngeal (OC/OPC) cancers afflict more than 53,000 individuals in the United States annually. Despite advancements in oncologic therapies, the majority of patients will experience significant toxicity burden during and after therapy, including moderate-severe xerostomia, reduced mouth opening (i.e. trismus), periodontal disease, and osteoradionecrosis. To date, acute and chronic orodental complications are largely managed by clinicians and dentists based on empirical knowledge, with wide inter-provider management variability influenced by provider experience and available clinical information which is often incomplete, incorrect, or nonexistent. To further complicate long-term care of OC/OPC survivors, there is no standardized method for communicating with dentists the extent and intensity of radiation doses delivered to tooth bearing areas which is vital information for accurate assessment of risks related to dental procedures. Therefore, development of a standardized radiotherapy dental information tool and data-driven, algorithmic toxicity risk prediction models for enhanced communication and personalized medicine for OC/OPC survivors remains an unmet public health need. In response to NIDCR’s NOT-DE-20-006, we herein propose a rigorous and reproducible application of informatics and computational methods and approaches for the development of machine learning “ML/AI based optimization of clinical procedures for precision dental care”, “novel and robust data analysis algorithms to tackle causal mechanisms of action for onset and progression of disease” related to posttherapy orodental complications, and “computational modeling for treatment planning and assessment of treatment outcomes.” In Specific Aim 1, we will train and validate a deep learning contouring (DLC) neural network for automatic delineation of tooth-bearing regions. Our collaborator, Dr. van Dijk, has previous experience with DLC design and application for auto-delineation of non-dental head and neck organs at risk (OAR). Her research, published in a peer-reviewed journal showing an equal or significantly improved OAR automatic delineation using DLC over atlas-based contouring, will serve as a reproducible model for our proposed project. Using DLC-based mandibular and dental OAR delineation (SA 1), we will develop a novel “radiation odontogram” which will generate automated and accurate summative radiotherapy dose distribution mapping reports for effective datatransmission and communication among providers (SA 2). Accurate prognosis and management of high-morbidity high-prevalence post-therapy orodental sequelae will be enabled through the development of a statistically robust machine-learning based model of toxicity risk predictions that incorporates patient- and provide-generated data(Aim 3). In summary, the RADMAP proposal fosters innovative informatics and computational modeling approaches to address existing challenges in multidisciplinary communication and precision dental care for OC/OPC survivors, with practice-changing implications in the clinical setting and for oral, dental, and craniofacial research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advancements in multimodal therapy for oral cavity and oropharyngeal (OC/OPC) cancer s have improved survival outcomes beyond 5 years. However, most survivors will experience moderate-severe orodental sequelae that are inadequately monitored or managed given the absence of structured communication of delivered therapies or robust toxicity risk prediction models to aid in decision -making. The proposed research aims to address these unmet public health needs by using core informatics and computational learning methods to develop a novel radiation odontogram and an automated, machine-learning based algorithm for accurate therapy-related orodental toxicity risk predictions.",Radiation-specific Automated Dental Dose Distributions via Machine-learning based Mapping for Accurate Predictions of (Peri)odontal Problems (RADMAP),10285226,R21DE031082,"['Adoption ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atlases ', ' Award ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Communication ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Delphi Technique ', ' Delphi Technic ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Mandible ', ' Inferior Maxillary Bone ', ' mandibular ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Diet-derived oxysterols shape intestinal B cell fate by controlling intracellular cholesterol metabolism Abstract B lymphocytes in the gastrointestinal tract are constantly stimulated by commensals microbial antigens. In order to prevent commensal outgrowth and maintain intestinal homeostasis, B cells need to mount a rapid antibody response against bacterial antigens. To achieve this task, the humoral immune system relies on a complex multistep process of B cell proliferation and selection in the germinal center, which eventually gives rise to either antibody secreting plasma cells or memory B cells. Intestinal B cells are also exposed to dietary and microbial metabolites during their activation and differentiation, but how these environmental cues shape B cell fate and antibody response in the gut is poorly understood. Therefore, elucidating the fundamental mechanisms that intrinsically regulate the fate and function of individual B cell clones in the gut remains a central question in immunology. Several lines of evidence indicate that metabolic switches act as intrinsic regulators of germinal center B cell response. However, how B cells integrate metabolite sensing with germinal center and antibody response remains undefined to date. In this application we test the hypothesis that the oxysterol 25-HC, an oxidized form of cholesterol, directly controls germinal center B cell response through its interaction with the Sterol Response Element Binding Protein 2 (SREBP2). SREBP2 is a key regulator of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, and its transcriptional activity in the intestinal germinal center B cells couples lipid metabolism and B cell differentiation in the intestine. We also hypothesize that follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), stromal cells which are located in the germinal center, produce 25-HC in response to dietary cholesterol and microbiome, therefore linking rapidly changing intestinal homeostasis to B cell fate. Accumulating evidence indicates that 25-HC controls SREBP2 processing, but the implication for this cross talk in B cells in the gut has not been investigated so far. Our aims are: 1) To test the hypothesis that SREBP2 activity controls germinal center B cell transcriptional profile and B cell fate; and 2) To define the environmental and cellular cues that regulate 25-HC niche. The proposed studies examine a very poorly understood crosstalk between oxidized form of cholesterol, intestinal metabolism and adaptive immune system activation. It is our expectation that these studies will increase our understanding of how intestinal metabolism shapes B cell responses and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, these studies will provide a foundation for better understanding of the relationship between lipid metabolism and differentiation in immune cells. Narrative Intestinal humoral response occurs in an environment exposed to multiple metabolic stimuli, from both diet and commensal bacteria. We identified the transcription factor SREBP2 as a potential key regulator of germinal center response. Oxysterols, oxidized forms of cholesterol, have been shown to control SREBP2 activation and transcription activity. This proposal aims to identify the mechanisms by which SREBP2 shapes germinal center B cell differentiation in antibody-secreting plasma cells and to map oxysterol niche and its extrinsic requirements. Thus, insight into the oxysterols-SREBP2 axis during germinal center B cell differentiation and into the cellular and environmental regulation of oxysterol production, will be generated from this

"Algorithm-based prevention and reduction of cancer health disparity arising from data inequality Ethnic minority groups have a long-term cumulative data disadvantage in biomedical research and clinical studies. Statistics have shown that over 90% of the samples in cancer-related GWAS and clinical omics projects were collected from Individuals of European ancestry. This severe data disadvantage of the ethnic minority groups is set to produce new health disparities as data-driven, algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical decisions become increasingly common. The new cancer disparity arising from data inequality can potentially impact all ethnic minority groups in all types of cancers where data inequality exists. Thus, its negative impact is not limited to the cancer types or subtypes for which significant ethnic disparities have already been evident. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to prevent or reduce the heath disparities arising from the data disadvantage of ethnic minority groups. The overall objective of this work is to obtain key knowledge and create open resources to establish a new paradigm for machine learning with multiethnic clinical omics data. Our central hypothesis is that the knowledge learned from data of the majority population can be transferred to improve machine learning performance on the data-disadvantaged ethnic minority groups. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursuit two specific aims to 1) Discover from cancer clinical omics data and genotype-phenotype data: under what conditions and to what extent the transfer learning scheme improves machine learning model performance on data-disadvantaged ethnic minority groups; 2) Create an open resource system for unbiased multiethnic machine learning to prevent or reduce new health disparities arising from the data disadvantage of ethnic minorities. The approach is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by shifting the paradigm of multiethnic machine learning from mixture learning and independent learning schemes to a transfer learning scheme. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to establish a new paradigm for unbiased multiethnic machine learning and to provide an open resource system to facilitate the paradigm shift, and thus to prevent or reduce health disparities arising from the data disadvantage of ethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities have a severe data-disadvantage that is set to produce new health disparities as data-driven and algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical decisions become increasingly common. The proposed research addresses this challenge by discovering critical knowledge and creating open resources for a paradigm shift in multiethnic machine learning using cancer clinical omics data.

"Robust, Generalizable, and Fair Machine Learning Models for Biomedicine Project Summary  Modern machine learning approaches have attained substantial success in pattern recognition and high-dimensional data analyses. However, these algorithms heavily rely on association discovery, which cannot elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the observed correlations and suffers from limited generalizability. To address this challenge, the Yu Lab focuses on the development of robust and generalizable machine learning approaches to integrate various types of biomedical data, including multi-omics, pathology, and phenotypic information. The goal of the next five years is to develop novel computational methods that connect machine learning algorithms with causal inference methodologies to better understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning disease pathology and enable fair and robust predictions of drug response and toxicity. The overall vision of the proposed research program is to establish generalizable data-driven methods to transform biomedical data into robust prediction and mechanistic models. The proposed approach will systematically connect diverse biomedical signals to extract previously unknown knowledge on the molecular mechanisms and derive reliable prediction models for the effects of medications. The proposed approaches are innovative because they depart from the status quo by incorporating advanced causal inference techniques with data-driven algorithms to enhance mechanistic and predictive modeling. This research program is significant because it is expected to improve our understanding of disease pathology and provide a fair and generalizable informatics framework for drug response and adverse effects prediction in diverse populations. The proposed research activities will open new research horizons by establishing a new machine learning platform for generating reliable predictions, which will vertically advance molecular biology, pharmacology, and computational research in biomedicine.

"MusIC: A multi-scale technology for integrating dynamic cellular function and molecular profiles Our objective is develop and rigorously validate a transformative technology that integrates cellular functions/activities with their deep molecular signatures at single-cell resolution, in high-throughput. Immunotherapy has emerged as a highly effective approach for the treatment of human cancer, and works by harnessing the power of the immune system and its ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Immunotherapy has distinct advantages, including: (i) sustained and durable responses; (ii) defined mechanisms of action; and (iii) higher specificity and fewer-off target effects than traditional approaches. Along with antibody immunotherapy, genetically engineering T cells for redirecting immune responses has recently received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), based on infusing in vitro expanded T cells bearing either T-cell receptors (TCR), or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), have demonstrated dramatic and durable responses, even in heavily pretreated patients. Despite these initial clinical successes, patient responses vary widely. Recent correlative data indicate that variability in the manufactured T cell products may be the primary determinant of clinical success. Since cellular infusion products are a heterogeneous mixture of cells, mapping the complexity of the population requires the ability to identify the function and molecular profiles of cells at single-cell resolution. There is an essential need for technologies that are able to map this complexity in T-cell functionality and being able to link function to molecular profiles at single-cell resolution. We propose the development and validation of Multiscale Intelligent Convergence (MusIC). MusIC will provide multi-scale data from molecules to subcellular dynamics to cell-cell interaction biology on the same cells across thousands of cells. Given the heterogeneity in the composition of cells being used for ACT, it serves as the ideal system for the development and validation of MusIC. Our team of investigators has expertise in single-cell technology development and immunotherapy, machine learning, and image analysis and data modeling. We anticipate that the successful implementation of this proposal will enable the validation of MusIC as a platform for studying multi-scale cell biology. This in turn, will lead to the more reliable biomanufacturing of T-cell infusion products, and the engineering of more potent immune cells can have a broad impact on immunotherapy. We propose to develop and validate a technology for the multi-scale profiling of cells at the single-cell level. We anticipate that this technology will fundamentally alter the characterization of immune cells in the context of immunotherapy and vaccines.",MusIC: A multi-scale technology for integrating dynamic

"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",10392661,R01GM136859,"['Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Data ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Resolution ', ' Therapeutic Studies ', ' Therapy Research ', ' Computational Technique ', ' protein function ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' artificial neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' automated analysis ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Crowding ', ' Environment ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Isotope Labeling ', ' Isotopes ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Medical Research ', ' Specialist ', ' Biochemical ', ' insight ', ' ']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,13250
"Equipment to facilitate expansion of MMRRC services related to gut microbiota and infectious diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and future infectious agents PROJECT SUMMARY An overarching goal of the Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of Missouri (MU- MMRRC) is to optimize and refine mouse models so that biomedical research using these models can proceed rapidly and effectively. The MU-MMRRC also conducts resource-related research, often collaboratively, to further refine and develop mutant mice and capitalize on the power of mouse genetics and associated microbiota for biomedical research. This proposal enhances the capacity of the MU MMRRC to further characterize and refine mouse models through characterization of biological material and enhance our capability to examine the role of infectious disease and the gut microbiome. In the immediate future this equipment will enhance our ongoing and proposed studies of COVID-19. As part of previous supplemental funding, the MU-MMRRC has succeeded in advancing this mouse strain as a model for human COVID-19, characterizing viral growth and the development of acute disease following intranasal and aerosol infection of mice with variations in gut microbiota and prior infection, recapitulating the disease in humans. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge from human samples the K18-hACE2 mouse will play a key role in evaluating pathogenesis and escape of immunity. As of May of 2021, there have been nearly 32 million survivors of COVID-19 in the United States. As an acute local and systemic inflammatory response is known to cause long-term post-infectious diseases such as chronic pulmonary and neurological diseases, the equipment requested for supplement funding will permit the MU-MMRRC an ability to further characterize and refine the mouse model for the benefit of short- and long-term biomedical research. In addition, this equipment will help the MU-MMRRC expand its ability to phenotype other mouse models in line with its long-term research goals of characterizing and optimizing mouse models by examining the effects of differing microbiota. Current equipment available for use in the BSL3 and ABSL3 laboratories is limited across the nation, effectively slowing COVID-19 research during this pandemic. Expanding the capacity of the BSL3 equipment resources available to analyze infected samples will allow the MU-MMRRC to continue to play a critical role in the biomedical research community and promote studies of pathogenesis for COVID-19. The objective of this proposal is therefore to provide several key pieces of equipment that are expected to be of use not only to COVID-19 researchers, but also provide flexibility to other researchers in the region and nation for studying disease pathogenesis in mouse BSL3 models. The resulting expansion of capabilities will be critical to research on these devastating diseases and on mouse models in general. Crucially, this equipment has use far beyond the pandemic and has been specifically chosen to enhance the parent grant’s research goals during this funding cycle and into future funding cycles. . PROJECT NARRATIVE The Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center at the University of Missouri (MU-MMRRC) develops tools to optimize and facilitate research using mouse models of disease. These include ongoing research and collaborative studies designed to optimize the understanding of a mouse model of COVID-19 through natural history studies, microbiota manipulation, and development of aerosol inoculation strategies. In this proposal the capabilities of the MMRRC for research within the state-of-the-art biocontainment facilities available at MU will be enhanced through the acquisition of equipment for sensitive, high throughput quantification of infection and disease state. The proposed equipment infrastructure will enhance the impact of the MMRRC and mouse modeling to accelerate our understanding of acute and post-infectious diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and to expand the current value-added services of the MU-MMRRC.",Equipment to facilitate expansion of MMRRC services related to gut microbiota and infectious diseases including SARS-CoV-2 and future

"Gradient biomaterials to investigate niche regulation of hematopoiesis ABSTRACT Replicating the cascade of signals responsible for controlling stem cell behavior remains a critical challenge for biology and medicine. Hematopoiesis is the process where the body’s blood and immune cells are generated from a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation take place in, and are regulated by, unique regions of the bone marrow termed niches. HSCs are also the functional unit of therapeutic bone marrow transplants following myeloablative therapies. A major goal of the hematology community is to selectively expand HSCs without sacrificing a subpopulation of quiescent, long-term repopulating HSCs required for life-long hematopoiesis. Perivascular niches (PVNs) within the bone marrow are increasingly believed to present a constellation of matrix, biomolecular, and metabolic signals to support HSC expansion and quiescence, however their rarity and complexity can complicate direct in vivo examination. The long-term goal of this Stimulating Hematology Investigation – New Endeavors (SHINE) project is to advance a tissue engineering platform to achieve HSC expansion without exhaustion. In the previous funding period (R01DK099528), we established a tissue engineering ecosystem to examine the coordinated impact of niche- inspired biophysical signals and marrow-derived niche cells on HSC fate. We showed the kinetics of HSC-niche cell crosstalk can be manipulated via biomaterial design to dramatically alter HSC fate decisions. And we developed machine learning tools to identify secretome signals generated by niche-associated MSCs that enhance retention of quiescent HSCs. We build on these findings to investigate the coordinated effect of multicellular crosstalk, cell-mediated extracellular matrix remodeling, and hypoxic stress within the perivascular niche using biomimetic models of marrow sinusoidal vs. arteriolar vascular niches. The overall objective of this project is to define patterns of multicellular signaling and remodeling within an engineered PVN biomaterial in order to identify synthetic niches that promote HSC expansion without exhaustion. To address this goal we will first construct and thoroughly characterize an engineered perivascular niche (Aim 1). We will subsequently resolve patterns of niche remodeling and HSC-PVN crosstalk in response to hypoxia (Aim 2). And we will establish a microdroplet-based artificial marrow niche to encapsulate single murine HSCs in nanoliter-volume hydrogel droplets (Aim 3). Throughout, we will benchmark patterns of in vitro HSC expansion via the gold standard in vivo competitive repopulation assay. This proposed research is unified in our focus to use the well- characterized murine hematopoietic system to develop engineered niche technologies for HSC expansion. Consistent with score-driving criteria of the SHINE program, we will generate innovative tissue engineering infrastructure to define dynamic processes of remodeling and intercellular HSC-niche crosstalk necessary to achieve durable HSC expansion without exhaustion. NARRATIVE The body’s full complement of blood and immune cells are generated from a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in regions of the bone marrow termed niches. Niches provide diverse and dynamic matrix, metabolic, and cell-cell communication signals to regulate HSC stemness. The proposed research will develop and thoroughly characterize a tissue engineering ecosystem to replicate physiological signals within the niche in order to selectively expand HSCs ex vivo for therapeutic and experimental applications.",Gradient biomaterials to investigate niche regulation of hematopoiesis,10413538,R56DK099528,"['arteriole ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Engineering ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hematology ', ' Hematopoiesis ', ' Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms ', ' blood cell formation ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' blood stem cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hemopoietic progenitor ', ' hemopoietic stem cell ', ' Hematopoietic System ', ' Hematologic Body System ', ' Hematologic Organ System ', ' Hematopoietic Body System ', ' In Vitro ', ' Kinetics ', ' Medicine ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Mediating ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' base ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Marrow ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' extracellular ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' nano litre ', ' nanoliter ', ' nanolitre ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' Adventitial Cell ', ' Pericapillary Cell ', ' Perivascular Cell ', ' Rouget Cells ', ' Pericytes ', ' Hydrogels ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Biological Mimetics ', ' Biomimetics ', ' Cell to Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell-Cell Signaling ', ' intercellular communication ', ' Address ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' hematopoietic stem cell fate ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' self-renewal ', ' self-renew ', ' stemness ', ' Infrastructure ', ' hematopoietic stem cell niche ', ' HSC niche ', ' blood stem cell niche ', ' hematopoietic stem cell expansion ', ' HSC expansion ', ' blood stem cell expansion ', ' hematopoietic stem cell quiescence ', ' HSC quiescence ', ' blood stem cell quiescence ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R56,2021,99847

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10408272,R01GM131491,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Geography ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Collection ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Monitor ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,97191
"Software development for Stan to improve survey statistics for non-probability samples 1 Project Summary This proposal is a supplement to our NIH grant R01 AG067149-01: Improving Representativeness in Non-probability Surveys and Causal Inference with Regularized Regression and Poststrati cation. That project involves developing certain Bayesian methods for sampling adjustment in a general,  exible, and reliable way that can be used for a wide range of problems in public health research. The project requires extensive use of the Stan probabilistic programming platform, both as part of the research e ort and as part of resulting methods.  This NOSI is synergistic with that grant. It will support new software engineering initiatives to improve the core Stan platform in three ways: (1) Providing the option for JSON format outputs will improve interoperability and facilitate incorporating Bayesian methods into machine learning pipelines; (2) Extending and refactoring the core Stan inference algorithms for greater memory eciency and increased parallel processing will improve the overall speed and scalability of infer- ence, allowing for Bayesian methods to be used with increasingly complex models. This will allow researchers to compare a greater number and wider range of models in order to nd those with optimal behaviors. (3) The addition of a standard logging framework will bene t both the Stan user community and the developer community.  The parent grant's research agenda is threefold. Firstly, it is directed to addressing the unique challenges posed by public health datasets and questions by investigating adaptations to state-of- the art modelling techniques. Secondly, it strives to improve causal inferences for demographic subgroups. Thirdly, and more broadly, it seeks to improve current methodology by developing work ows to test and validate models with non-representative data in order to obtain better and more trustworthy population based estimates.  The work in the NOSI is relevant in two ways. First, it will directly support the research in the main project. During our research, computational challenges arise. The progress in research reveals areas where the computational infrastructure needs to be improved; thus, the NOSI will enable us to do our NIH-funded research more e ectively. Second, it's important for the results of our research to be used by others. The computing work in the NOSI will make it easier for applied practitioners to make use of the research we have been developing. Furthermore, the addition of a common data format for inputs and outputs, greater processing speed and eciency, and standardized logging will make it easier to use Stan in complex processing pipelines, therefore improving overall cloud-readiness. Project Narrative The computational developments in this supplement will enable more effective fitting of statistical models for adjusting data from non-probability surveys to be representative of populations of interest. Being able to fit these models more reliably will enable more efficient and reliable survey research for the purpose of estimating population characteristics and average causal effects in a wide range of problems in public health, with examples including longitudinal surveys of health and wellbeing, surveys of hard-- to-reach populations, and effects of experimental interventions.

"Identifying novel targets for cardioprotection with non-traditional animal models Project Summary/Abstract:  Low-cost sequencing has ushered in a new era of drug discovery that can that utilize genomic information from hundreds of thousands of people. However, humans are a limited resource for identifying novel drug targets, and attempts at therapeutic development often rely on an already well-known set of genes and pathways. Greater potential for discovery exists if we broaden our search throughout the animal kingdom. In particular, animal adaptations for disease resistance have great potential to unearth novel biological pathways to counteract human diseases. Hibernating mammals are an especially rich resource to inspire novel therapeutics as they exhibit numerous transient phenotypes that mirror critical human health problems such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, and obesity/diabetes, yet they are able to avoid or reverse pathologies. A systematic understanding of the gene networks utilized to generate the protective and healing phenotypes of hibernators has great potential to reveal novel therapeutic avenues; however, targets that reproduce across independent datasets, including associating with the same phenotype across multiple species have higher likelihood of translating to humans. In this proposal, specifically, we propose to (1) obtain high-throughput phenotypic data to test our platform (2) create a better model for identifying targets based on machine learning and (3) grow our approach into new disease areas. Our long-term vision is to develop a genomics discovery platform centered on hibernating animals for all of the diseases discussed above. We believe that our approach will identify novel therapeutic targets that will translate to humans, and we will advance our discoveries through strategic pharmaceutical partnerships.

"Joint submission for administrative supplement proposal: HIPAA aligned storage and computing solution Summary: Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Current investigation of mechanisms underlying many diseases relies on the acquisition of multi-dimensional genomics data. The utility of these data is, however, offset by the lag in development of tools and models to fully interrogate them. In the context of infectious diseases, such data contains molecular information including gene transcription, regulation, and variations from both the infecting pathogen and the host cell, providing a snapshot of the host and pathogen interactions (HPIs). These HPIs determine infection outcomes. For instance, when a pathogen evades, or evolves resistance to defensive host immunity via a multifaceted HPI, it can result in persisting infection, chronic inflammation, malignant transformation, and/or elevated mortality. Recent successes in overcoming immune-evasion of infected tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the clinical gains that can be made by identifying and specifically targeting essential mechanisms of HPIs. Hence, precisely identifying new mode(s) of HPIs is critical for development of effective and personalized interventions. The molecular mechanisms of HPIs underpinning disease can be identified from genomics data. For example, information on whether a transcription factor (TF) regulates genes from either host or pathogen, or both, can be captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of infected host cells. This means that integrative analysis of genome-scale data can provide a platform for large-scale and unbiased detection of often multi- dimensional and novel facets of HPIs in host cells. However, there is a lack of data mining tools and models to extract such information. More importantly, the available analysis tools typically focus on data from either the host or the pathogen and not on the interactions occurring between the two, excluding us from investigating the full HPI spectrum. Thus, novel methods to determine HPIs by simultaneously modeling both host and pathogen data are critical for understanding key cellular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies. My lab specializes in developing computational models to construct HPI maps and to experimentally validate them. As proof-of-principle, we produced a comprehensive HPI map from sequencing samples from large numbers of tumors caused by Epstein–Barr virus. This map delivered unprecedented insights, identifying novel viral integrations, mutations linked to viral reactivation and providing molecular classification of tumors expected to yield individualized cancer therapy. Therefore, my lab is uniquely positioned to uncover mechanistic insights from HPIs. Our program seeks to develop new models and machine learning tools to construct HPI maps in several diseases by focusing on the following major questions: 1) how do expression, integration, and mutational landscapes of host and pathogen affect pathogenesis of disease?; 2) what is the nature of physical HPIs and cross-regulation by major host and pathogen factors that modulate gene expression, such as TFs and RNA binding proteins?; 3) how do HPIs define molecular subtypes to guide personalized treatments? We expect to identify novel HPIs and provide systems-level understanding of mechanisms critical to cell biology. 091221!345""6""""'""""$""""'$&&""'#""""%""",Joint submission for administrative supplement proposal: HIPAA aligned storage and computing solution,10388739,R35GM138283,"['Affect ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' EB virus ', ' EBV ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' HHV-4 ', ' HHV4 ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Immunity ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Virus Integration ', ' viral integration ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' success ', ' HIPAA ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting Initiative ', ' Molecular Profiling Initiative ', ' Molecular Classification of Tumors ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' tool development ', ' tumor ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' genome analysis ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Immune Evasion ', ' Immune checkpoint inhibitor ', ' Checkpoint inhibitor ', ' immune check point inhibitor ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIGMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,100000
"Cell type atlasing of whole human brains using HOLiS: an optimized pipeline for staining, clearing, imaging, and analysis Project Summary (Abstract) Gaining a comprehensive understanding of brain-wide cellular organization in the human brain has long been recognized as a critical foundation for understanding complex brain functions, including who we are as humans. In this project we propose to take on this challenge and establish a pipeline capable of imaging the entire human brain at cellular resolution. We believe that the convergence of our novel technologies for tissue processing and clearing, ultra-fast 3D microscopy and highly efficient analysis will make this problem tractable and scalable, marking a new paradigm in human brain research. As part of BICCN, the Osten and Wu labs, have already made significant progress towards deciphering the cell type and three-dimensional organizational logic of the mouse brain, using both genetic and molecular labeling in combination with whole mouse brain imaging. However, scaling efforts ~2,000x from mouse to human brain requires both technical and conceptual innovation to extract maximum information and ensure high efficiency. Our approach will center on a new Human brain Optimized Light-Sheet HOLiS microscopy platform developed by the Hillman lab, whose speed, efficiency and multiplexing capabilities are expected to enable cellular- resolution imaging across the entire human brain in only a few days. The HOLiS platform is complemented by a new optimized tissue preparation method for human brain developed by the Wu lab, named HuB.Clear, optimized for multiplexed staining and clearing of highly tractable 5 mm thick, full human brain slabs. Our computational data analysis pipelines developed by the Osten lab will leverage deep learning-based data analysis and permit every cell in the brain to be registered within the whole brain 7T MRI volume. Our new human brain common coordinate framework will include cellular diversity analysis based on multiplex protein profiling and precise spatial characterization. The following benchmarks will be achieved during the 3-year project: Our tissue preparation method will provide: 1) complete tissue clearing while preserving morphology to allow faithful data production and integration with MRI, and 2) reliable and quantitative whole mount immunolabeling with diverse targets to allow multiplex molecular profiling across the entire brain. Our imaging technology will provide: 1) sufficient resolution and multiplexing capacity, and 2) high-throughput speed to allow exhaustive analyses across multiple whole human brains. Our data analysis methods will provide: 1) infrastructure capable of processing whole human brain imaging data, and 2) algorithms optimized for HOLiS to extract and interpret rich molecular and cellular information with the latest advances in computer science. The resulting pipeline will be easily scalable and sharable with maximized benefit-cost ratio, opening the door to imaging 100's or even 1,000's of human brains in coming years. Our results will link cellular diversity and morphology with molecular signatures across the entire human brain at a sufficient cellular resolution and to facilitate further functional investigations and cross-species comparisons in synergy with other BICCN efforts. Narrative Over the past decade, many techniques have been developed for mapping the brains of mice in exquisite detail, revealing the organization patterns of different types of cells and their connections with each other. However, we have yet to gain similar knowledge about the human brain, and have never before been able to evaluate an entire human brain in-toto at cellular resolution. Such data could teach us for the first time how the organization and structure of the human brain gives rise to behavior, emotion and cognition. In this project, we will leverage the latest technologies for tissue clearing, labeling, high-speed imaging and big-data analysis to establish a pipeline for imaging entire human brains rapidly and efficiently enough to permit wide-spread analysis and comparison of 100's of human brains with rich cellular and anatomical details in near future.","Cell type atlasing of whole human brains using HOLiS: an optimized pipeline for staining, clearing, imaging, and analysis",10377810,RF1MH128969,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Atlases ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Emotions ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Logic ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Production ', ' Refractive Indices ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Information extraction ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Knowledge ', ' exhaustion ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' protein profiling ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' magnetic field ', ' brain cell ', ' computer science ', ' synergism ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Sampling ', ' tissue preparation ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' tissue processing ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Slice ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' scale up ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' comparative ', ' brain research ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' targeted imaging ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,RF1,2021,9121879
"Development of machine learning approaches to population pharmacokinetic model selection and evaluation of application to model-based bioequivalence analysis. PROJECT SUMMARY  The proposed project is for development an evaluation of a deep learning/reinforcement learning approach to population pharmacokinetic model selections. We proposed to develop a command line application using the Python programing language. Python is the current industry standard for development or artificial intelligence applications, and the required packages for deep learning/reinforcement learning are readily available (e.g., Pytorch and Tensorflow). The applicants have previously developed a related machine learning approach using Genetic Algorithm. For purposes of comparison and to make the resulting application generally available, the existing Genetic Algorithm solution will be ported to Python. Both applications (Deep learning/reinforcement learning and Genetic Algorithm) will use NONMEM ® for parameter estimation for the population pharmacokinetic models examined. A common solution linking the model selection algorithm (Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Algorithm) to NONMEM will be used for both, and is currently under development, with an early version available on github.com. This common solution will facilitate future work using other algorithms for model selection, e.g. particle swarm optimization or simulated annealing. This work will be completed in the first year of the project. All final code will be place in the public domain in github.com.  The second year of the project will consist of evaluation of the solutions (Genetic algorithm and Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning). This evaluation will include assessment of a range of measures of the “goodness” of the model (“fitness in Genetic Algorithm and “reward signal” in Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning). These measure of model “goodness” may include objective function value, parsimony penalties, importance of successful covariance step. Within the scope of this project, these measures will be objective and numerical. Future projects may include the addition of subjective evaluations of model “goodness” in the model selection algorithm. CONFIDENTIAL Page 1 of 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE The current project is intended to improve both the efficiency and robustness of Population Pharmacokinetic analysis. These improvements are expected to have an impact of both the timeline for Population Pharmacokinetics models (resulting in getting new drug to patients more quickly) and the value of the models in drug development decision making. We feel that the rapidly evolving field of machine learning can be leveraged in drug development, reproducing the gains made in other fields including drug discovery and diagnostics.

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10372262,R01GM131491,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gases ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ions ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Smoking ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Stress ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' data quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' cohort ', ' validation studies ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' NMR Spectrometer ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Metabolite Interaction ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical effect ', ' interoperability ', ' user-friendly ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' metabolome ', ' metabonome ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' lipidomics ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,431464

"Enabling Next Generation Machine Learning for Large Scale Image Analysis Project Summary/Abstract Deep learning has transformed medical image analysis by delivering clinically meaningful results on challenging problems like prostate cancer detection and lung screening. In pathology, industry is making signiﬁcant invest- ments to develop deep learning tools for diagnostic use in clinical labs. FDA approval of whole-slide digital pathology images (WSIs) for use in primary diagnosis is further increasing interest, adoption, and investment in this technology. Judgments made by pathologists are the basis for the treatment of many diseases, yet in- terobserver variability among pathologists is signiﬁcant, and errors can lead to overtreatment or even treatment of healthy patients. Pathology is also facing workforce issues as demand for pathologist services is outpacing growth of trained pathologists. Computational pathology tools based on deep learning can help address these problems by providing reproducible diagnoses, performing ”second reads” for human pathologists, automating tasks to improve pathologist efﬁciency, and helping general pathologists evaluate challenging cases. GPU accel- erators have played a signiﬁcant role in advancing deep learning methods to build computational pathology tools, with machine learning frameworks (MLFs) like Pytorch and Tensorﬂow providing researchers with abstractions to quickly develop models that utilize GPUs. Evolution of GPUs and MLFs has been driven by analysis of small images, and so these tools cannot be easily applied directly WSIs or other large medical images like three dimen- sional MRI or CT. Adapting medical imaging problems to small image paradigms supported by GPUs and MLFs leads to suboptimal performance and increased implementation effort and complexity. More recent approaches that use streaming or ”uniﬁed memory” allow direct analysis of entire WSIs and have demonstrated performance advantages. These approaches can be slow, complex to implement, and are highly speciﬁc to a choice of network architecture which limits exploration and development of new architectures. More general-purpose, efﬁcient, and user-friendly frameworks are required to allow the development of WSI scale deep learning.  This project will develop techniques to automatically map deep learning networks implemented in common MLF architectures to one or more GPUs for arbitrarily large input images and activation layers. The proposed software will include a performance modeler to estimate the runtime of a given network on available GPU acceler- ators. These strategies will enable a new paradigm in deep learning for medical images, allowing the development of novel networks that are purpose-built for medical applications. Developers will be able to rapidly create and evaluate these networks using familiar MLF packages. This project will provide approaches to overcome GPU memory bottlenecks, a scheduler to map the network to available GPUs, integration with common MLFs, and demonstration using computational pathology use cases. Narrative The proposed tools will help software developers overcome the limitations of current computing hardware to design more accurate deep learning models for use in clinical diagnostics. These models will be able to analyze very large digitized images of glass slides to aid pathologists in tasks like cancer detection. The ability to analyze these images in their entirety instead of in small parts will improve the diagnostic accuracy of models and will accelerate algorithm development efforts.",Enabling Next Generation Machine Learning for Large Scale Image Analysis,10384903,R41EB032722,"['Adoption ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Glass ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Industry ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Investments ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' detect prostate cancer ', ' prostate cancer detection ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Imaging problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' screening ', ' network architecture ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' algorithm development ', ' implementation efforts ', ' ']",NIBIB,"RNET TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R41,2021,239827
"Phospholipid antimetabolite lipid ether amines for topical treatment of chronic wounds and associated biofilms. ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect over 2.5 million patients in the US alone, lasting on average 12-13 months and recurring in 60-70% of patients. These occur primarily in lower extremities and vascular disease, diabetes, nephropathy, and metabolic dysfunction are prevalent co-morbidities. These wounds frequently harbor bacterial infections as mixed Gram-negative (e.g. P. aeruginosa, PA) and Gram-positive biofilms (e.g. S. aureus, SA), conferring resistance to antibiotic therapy and inhibiting resolution. The heterogenous biofilm barrier, composed of lipids, proteins, and polysaccharides, presents a robust physiochemical barrier and substrate for persistent infection. Transition of planktonic bacteria to the distinct biofilm state requires a suitable substrate for specific adhesin receptors, such as those found in host membranes and extracellular matrix (ECM), or nonspecific physiochemical binding, enabling aggregation and biofilm ECM organization. This includes changes in microbial lipid composition, secretion of lipid quorum signals and lipase virulence factors, and shift to oxidative lipid metabolism to enable persistent colonization and high-density proliferation. Recent advances in ultra-high- performance liquid chromatography, high resolution mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics technologies have enabled detailed and accurate definition of the bacterial lipidome, aiding in identification of lipid pathways and targets for antimicrobial activity using a systems biology approach. Wound healing is further complicated by pro-inflammatory endogenous phospholipase activities. We propose that lipid ether amines (LEA) represent a platform for novel topical wound treatments with phospholipid anti- metabolite activity, counteracting both host and pathogen pathogenic mechanisms. As preliminary data, we demonstrate >3-log (>1000x) colony forming unit reductions in multiple in vitro cultured, antibiotic resistant biofilms and optimization of anti-metabolite activity. Phase I will synthesize additional candidates, screen for biofilm reduction and activity in host cells, selecting a platform lead to determine in vivo wound healing effects using biofilm infected db/db diabetic mouse model. LC-MS/MS analysis will be used to characterize bacterial or host lipidomes and treatment effect in each Aim. In Aim I, LEA candidate compounds will be screened for antimicrobial effect using clinically relevant, drug resistant ESKAPE (E. faecium, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) pathogens in cultured biofilms, including a translatable wounded ex vivo pig skin explant model. In Aim II, LEA effects on migration and proliferation will be assessed using in vitro full thickness skin construct. In Aim III, the lead compound will be applied in a diabetic mouse wound healing model infected with PA or SA biofilms, to assess in vivo microbicidal and wound closure effects. In Phase II, we will escalate in vivo model complexity by inoculating with mixed bacterial biofilms, refine mechanism using in vitro binding and knock-down/out, evaluate potential adaptive resistance mechanisms, conduct comprehensive ADME-T study, and begin in vivo large mammal Proof of Concept for IND submission. NARRATIVE Chronic wounds are a ubiquitous healthcare problem, particularly as diabetic foot ulcers, often resulting in amputation. Treatment-resistant biofilm colonization inhibits resolution, combined approach of eliminating bacterial biofilm pathogens while correcting host wound dysfunction has the potential for enhancing resolution of chronic wounds.

"Spatial omics technologies to map the senescent cell microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Cellular senescence is a biological program whereby cells exit the cell cycle, typically as a consequence of DNA damage accumulation. After exerting their beneficial effects in young individuals by playing a role in tissue homeostasis, wound healing and tumor suppression, senescent cells are recognized and cleared by the immune system in response to their senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). With age, immunosurveillance becomes increasingly dysregulated, senescent cells accumulate in tissues and their SASP leads to chronic inflammation which has been linked to many age-associated diseases including neurodegeneration, diabetes, osteoarthritis, fibrosis, heart disease and cancer. In addition, radiation and chemotherapy cause the accumulation of senescent cells in both normal and cancer tissues and create a microenvironment which can promote tumor relapse. Hence, methods to characterize the diversity of senescent cells in tissues are critical to improve our understanding of their roles in both normal physiology and disease and to develop more precise and effective senolytic and senostatic interventions. We propose to develop new technologies and integrative solutions to map the spatial epigenomic, transcriptome and proteomic states of senescent cells and their microenvironment in complex tissues. In the UG3 phase, we will develop spatial genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics methodologies to delineate senescent cells in a diverse set of murine tissues, including brain, liver and adipose tissue. We will also perform feasibility studies in a limited number of human samples available through tissue banks and collaborators, and in human cell culture. Our goal is to provide a proof of principle and evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of our proposed tools, technologies and methods (TTM) to identify and characterize the heterogeneity of senescent cells in multiple tissues. In the HG3 phase, we will optimize and expand our methodology to a variety of human tissues obtained from normal samples available from tissue banks, and via collaborations with other SenNet Tissue Mapping Centers (TMCs). Project Narrative Identification of senescent cells in tissues is particularly challenging as it requires detection of sets of markers that can be cell type specific. Our goal is to develop single cell multi-omic imaging technology to measure proteins, RNA and the DNA’s 3-dimensional conformation in senescent cells and in their microenvironment, in a diverse set of tissues. This new technology will allow us to better understand the heterogeneity of the senescent phenotype in tissues, and to study how senescent cells affect the status of neighboring cells.",Spatial omics technologies to map the senescent cell microenvironment,10384585,UG3CA268202,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunologic Surveillance ', ' Immune Surveillance ', ' Immunologic Surveillances ', ' Immunological Surveillance ', ' Immunological Surveillances ', ' Immunosurveillance ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intrinsic factor ', ' Laboratories ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Relapse ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue repository ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Dissociation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Nuclear ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Transcript ', ' Tumor Suppression ', ' Molecular Tumor Suppression ', ' Molecular ', ' epigenomics ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Imaging technology ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Chemotherapy and/or radiation ', ' Chemotherapy and Radiation ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,UG3,2021,357900
"MADIVA  (Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application) Project summary – MADIVA: Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application Research Hub Our research hub will develop data science to address the complex interplay, individual and public health challenges, and rising prevalence of multimorbidity in Africans. Epidemiological transition in Africa has greatly changed health risks at both individual and public health levels. Trauma, infectious & non- communicable diseases are major health challenges; multiple occurrences multiply burdens for individuals and communities. The inherent value from the increasingly rich and varied existing data has not been exploited. We have rich longitudinal epidemiological data sets, partial but increasingly available clinical and laboratory records, and genomic data. The data, as is common in the domain, is highly heterogeneous, and in parts, fragmented and incomplete. The Hub will be led by the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg collaborating with the African Population and Health Research Center (Nairobi, Kenya), IBM Research Africa, the South African Population Research Infrastructure Network and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The initial sites are an urban population in Nairobi, and a rural, transitioning, site in Bushbuckridge, South Africa: each has rich longitudinal data of >100,000 individuals. Although incomplete, clinical records are increasingly being captured digitally. Notably there is genomic data from a subset of individuals at each of the sites. Multimorbidity is inherently multi-factorial — fragmented unlinked data retards solutions. Project 1 focuses on linking. Integrated data sets will aid in understanding these communities, representative of many in Africa, and protocols developed will be applicable elsewhere. A researcher dashboard will allow researchers to find data and plan projects. A clinic dashboard will help clinic managers and health officials to monitor and plan effectively. Project 2 will be solution-oriented to develop novel data science methods to provide actionable insights. We will develop robust methods for risk profiling of individuals and communities using heterogeneous data. We pioneer the use of polygenic risk scores in Africa. Key data science questions are explicability of results and managing high-dimensional data without loss of power. An innovative aspect of our grant will be translational work with public precision health to provide insights into drug dispensing, pharmacogenomics, and behavioral or possible social interventions. The Capacity Development & Pilot Project Core will support a tiered set of pilot projects for African researchers at different career stages, leveraging our strong research platforms and networks. We aim to build capacity in key areas including incubation and cost modelling for data science. The Administrative and Leadership Core will provide the necessary leadership and project management and linking to other DS-I components. The Data Management and Analysis Core will develop protocols for the responsible sharing of data, data quality control, technical support as well as innovate new analysis techniques. The MADIVA Research Hub will develop data science techniques and solutions to tackle the problem of multimorbidity in Africa – the problem of multiple co-occurring diseases significantly adding to the health burden in Africa. Our primary research sites in rural Bushbuckridge, South Africa and urban Nairobi, Kenya each have rich data sets from longitudinal studies collected by the health and demographic surveillance systems based there, together with a nascent set of clinical health records and genomic data. We will develop and apply data science techniques to link the different data sets, build dashboards for different stakeholders and apply new machine learning techniques to automatically stratify populations for risk profiles to different diseases, including the use of polygenic risk scores.","MADIVA  (Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital innovation, visualisation and application)",10314291,U54TW012077,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Africa ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Kenya ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' South Africa ', ' Technology ', ' Universities ', ' Urban Population ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' data quality ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' data sharing ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' clinical risk ', ' public health intervention ', ' data visualization ', ' Network Infrastructure ', ' Data Science ', ' South African ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' dashboard ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' population stratification ', ' Precision Health ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' risk prediction model ', ' social interventions ', ' Visualization ', ' heterogenous data ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' data infrastructure ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' metadata standards ', ' Data Store ', ' ']",FIC,"WITS HEALTH CONSORTIUM (PTY), LTD",U54,2021,1299340
"Development of Nanomembrane Electronics and Machine-Learning Algorithms for Quantitative Screening of Dysphagia Therapeutics Project Summary Dysphagia is an impairment of the swallow reflex's neurological and muscular functions that causes a debilitating and potentially deadly condition such as choking, malnutrition, dehydration or pneumonia during swallowing. Dysphagia afflicts almost 15 million Americans, particularly individuals 50-60 years or older with up to a 20% chance of dysphagia. However, regardless of the cause of dysphagia, currently there are no available therapeutic treatments. Limitation of preclinical tools and methods to study dysphagia is one of the biggest reasons for the lack of therapeutic treatment for dysphagia. Video-fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) has been used to diagnose dysphagia in a clinical study as well as research with animal models for drug development. However, the VFSS method in clinical study relies on the active cooperation of a human subject, such as ingestion of food with barium (oral contrast agent) and movement immobilization during X-ray imaging. The VFSS tool shows the severe issue in an animal study due to uncontrollable target, which results in poor image quality and unreliable drug development. Overall, none of the existing commercial systems can offer a portable, real-time, continuous monitoring of swallowing with either humans or animals. Here, this project will develop a novel, nanomembrane electronic system that offers a continuous, quantitative assessment of swallowing activities in a non-invasive way on the skin of rat models, which will help to develop potential dysphagia drugs. Specifically, we will develop soft, ultrathin, lightweight, miniaturized wearable electronics to monitor time-dependent changes of swallowing muscle functions via wireless, real-time recording of electromyograms on swallowing muscles of a dysphagia rat model. In this project, our initial study in the evaluation of dysphagia therapeutics will focus on ALS-related dysphagia since there are well-established animal models (transgenic superoxide dismutase; SODG93A) with severe dysphagia at a young age. SODG93A animal models have been widely used to screen potential therapeutic compounds, including two FDA-approved ALS drugs: edaravone and riluzole. Collectively, if successful, the newly developed nanomembrane electronics will be a game-changer in the therapeutic evaluation of candidate drugs for ALS-related dysphagia as well as other diseases- related dysphagia. The research outcome is expected to provide a new drug for an effective treatment of dysphagia, which will eventually reduce mortality and improve the quality of life of dysphagia patients. Project Narrative Dysphagia afflicts almost 15 million Americans, particularly individuals 50-60 years or older with up to a 20% chance of dysphagia. However, there is no available therapeutic treatment for dysphagia. Although ongoing research is focusing on the development of new drugs, none of the existing systems provides a quantitative, continuous evaluation of drug efficacy with animal models and human subjects.

"Development of a high throughput system for molecular imaging of different cell types in mouse brain tissues Development of a high throughput system for molecular imaging of different cell types in mouse brain tissues Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for developing detailed molecular maps of biological tissues with high specificity and sensitivity. This label-free technique enables simultaneous imaging of multiple classes of molecules including lipids, metabolites, and proteins thereby advancing the understanding of tissue organization and function. In this project, we will advance brain cell census research by developing an innovative platform for the acquisition of a comprehensive spatially-resolved cell-specific atlas of lipids, metabolites, and proteins in mouse brain tissue. The platform will combine MSI with immunofluorescence imaging to place the detailed molecular maps into the spatial cellular context within the brain tissue, which will facilitate image registration to the common coordinate system. Furthermore, we will develop deep learning and data mining approaches to enable automated assignment of molecular signatures to different cell types and efficient data sharing and comparison with other techniques. This research will address the existing bottlenecks in the experimental throughout and molecular coverage of the current MSI technologies along with the limitations of data analysis tools. Furthermore, our approach will compensate for signal suppression during ionization also called ‘matrix effects’, which is particularly severe in imaging of brain tissue. Such matrix effects common to all the MSI modalities including commercial MALDI MSI instruments interfere with the accurate measurement of the spatial localization of molecules. To overcome these challenges, we will advance the capabilities of nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI) - an ambient ionization technique, which efficiently compensates for matrix effects and thereby enables accurate and sensitive imaging of chemical gradients for hundreds of metabolites and lipids in biological tissue sections. Nano-DESI MSI does not require sample pretreatment, has a sub-femtomole sensitivity, and high spatial resolution. The new nano-DESI MSI system will provide a 5-fold increase in the experimental throughput and improve the spatial resolution of protein imaging in whole tissue sections from ~80 µm to ~10 µm. Coupling nano-DESI MSI with a high- resolution ion mobility mass spectrometer will substantially enhance molecular coverage. Meanwhile, co- registration of MSI with immunofluorescence data will be used to generate comprehensive 3D molecular maps of the mouse brain tissue. Collectively, these efforts will establish a robust imaging platform, which will transform our ability to generate detailed molecular maps of different cell types in brain tissues. Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for the high- throughput cell-specific imaging of molecules in brain tissue using mass spectrometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and advanced data mining and deep learning tools.

"The Nature and Function of Genomic Imprinting in Monoaminergic Neurons Mental illnesses are complex, affected by stressors and metabolic factors and involve changes to multiple behavioral components and decision-making processes. Thousands of genetic variants with small effects are typically involved. Thus, we lack a coherent genetic, cellular and evolutionary model for understanding and modifying important behavioral components affecting decision-making, activity and stress. If such a fundamental model of control could be uncovered for conserved, naturalistic behavior, our capabilities for understanding and therapeutically modifying behavioral disorders would be improved. Foraging has been studied for decades to uncover the basic principles and mechanisms of decision-making. Studies typically use simplified binary choice tests. However, we recently published a naturalistic foraging assay and unsupervised machine-learning methods to study complex, naturalistic decision patterns in mice. We discovered that foraging is composed of reproducible, genetically controlled behavioral sequences that we call “modules”. Using these methods, we investigated roles for maternally and paternally imprinted genes in controlling naturalistic decision patterns in males and females. Canonical imprinting involves complete silencing of one parent’s allele; however, we previously described genes with “noncanonical imprinting effects” that involve parental allele expression biases at the tissue level. We now have evidence that noncanonical imprinting effects at the tissue level involve allele silencing in subpopulations of cells. Moreover, we uncovered important roles for noncanonical imprinting effects in controlling naturalistic foraging and risk-reward-effort decision patterns. Currently, we do not fully understand the behavioral roles for different noncanonical imprinted genes. MEGs (maternally expressed genes) and PEGs (paternally expressed genes) are postulated to have opposing functional roles, suggesting an enticing genetic and evolutionary model of mammalian decision control. Imprinting effects in different cell populations could regulate the form, expression, timing and/or sequential order of different behavioral components of foraging. Therefore, our proposed study tests the hypothesis that noncanonical MEGs and PEGs have opposing effects on discrete behavioral components of naturalistic foraging and their cell-type specific imprinting effects reveal cell populations controlling discrete behaviors. In Aim 1, we will determine how MEGs and PEGs co-expressed with Th (tyrosine hydroxylase) and Ddc (dopa decarboxylase) in monoaminergic brain cells affect naturalistic decisions. In Aim 2, we will define functional links between discrete cell populations with imprinting effects for particular genes and discrete behavioral components of naturalistic foraging and decision patterns. Our proposed study is significant because it will help define an important genetic, cellular and evolutionary model of behavioral and decision control. Our long-term objective is to define a new conserved mechanistic model of control over decision patterns that helps delineate targets for therapeutically modifying human behavior.

"Map Manager: Longitudinal image analysis with online editing and sharing. The increasing availability and ease of use of confocal, two-photon, and light-sheet microscopes coupled with rapid developments in fluorescent protein reporters have made 3D and functional imaging and its analysis a central component of modern Neuroscience research. Yet, the ease of acquiring 3D and functional images is creating progressively larger datasets, prompting the need for high-throughput image analysis algorithms and software that can be both rapid and accurate. Although software to analyze single time-point images has received substantial attention, tools to analyze multiple time-point longitudinal imaging datasets is currently lacking. This lack of longitudinal image analysis tools is a major barrier to scientific inquiry with individual labs devising their own analysis strategies creating a situation where it is difficult for others to verify and reproduce this analysis. What is needed is a community agreed upon longitudinal image analysis standard that promotes sharing.  Here, we propose to develop software to create and curate annotations in longitudinal imaging datasets. This software will solve a major problem by providing the needed rigor and reproducibility while making it easy for researchers to distribute their data and analysis. Making these important datasets findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. To achieve these goals, we propose to build intuitive web-browser and desktop graphical-user-interfaces (GUIs) that will work with cloud based data and analysis. These GUIs will be driven by a Python advanced-programming-interface (API) that is scriptable. For online editing and sharing we will work with the BRAIN funded Brain Image Library (BIL), and for interoperability with Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) and Neuroscience Data Interface. We will utilize the BRAIN Initiative NeuroMorpho.Org and Defining Our Research Methodology (DORY), to ensure our annotations of morphology, connectivity, and physiological signatures include accepted meta-data nomenclatures and vocabularies.  We will work closely with a group of ""seed"" BRAIN funded labs to obtain feedback and make rapid improvements in the functionality and usability of the front-end GUIs and the back-end API. This will be achieved by online forums, site visits, and a hack-a-thon hosted at UC Davis. During the Covid pandemic we have learned that these events work extremely well when done virtually and are prepared to continue this model. We are committed to providing thorough documentation for the web-browser, desktop GUIs, and Python API as well as constantly refined and simple to follow recipes with interactive web-based use cases. To ensure community adoption and use, this proposal also includes working with a number of ""seed"" labs to run their data through the entire pipeline from analysis to online sharing.  The long range goal is to have Map Manager act as a catalyst for data analysis, exploration, and sharing. Effectively creating a community based approach, akin to other disciplines such as astronomy, where data is widely and publicly shared allowing effective data mining and model building to advance new discoveries. A major bottleneck in the interpretation of longitudinal imaging data is the availability of useful analysis software tools. The purpose of this proposal is to develop a rigorous and easy to use software ecosystem for the annotation, curation, and sharing of longitudinal imaging datasets. We will provide cloud-based editors and viewers that allow collaboration and dissemination of this critical data.",Map Manager: Longitudinal image analysis with online editing and

"Modeling the Coupled Dynamics of COVID-19 Transmission and Protective Behaviors Project Summary/Abstract A growing number of COVID-19 transmission models have been developed to help forecast the on-going epi- demic and compare outcomes of different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in terms of cases, deaths, and medical supply needs. Most of these models do not include adaptive behavioral effects describing how risk perceptions and fatigue inﬂuence engagement with social distancing and transmission reduction. Decisions on mask-wearing, levels of social contact, and vaccination will deﬁne whether the epidemic is controlled or enters annual circulation. We propose the development of population-based (PBM) and agent-based (ABM) transmis- sion models to study the interplay between individual behavior and transmission dynamics, while considering the many uncertainties which still surround the virus, such as seasonal effects and the loss of immunity. Addition- ally, our models will be used to study how COVID-19 and seasonal inﬂuenza and respective behaviors interact, exacerbate outcomes, and potentially overwhelm the health care system. These models will build upon our prior research. Since Fall 2016 we have conducted regular longitudinal surveys investigating attitudes towards, risk perceptions of, and propensity to vaccinate for seasonal inﬂuenza. The ABM models constructed from these data account for adaption and memory of past experiences, peer effects, and population heterogeneity. Using machine learning methods, we have augmented a synthetic network representative of a small US city with this behavioral data. We have continued to conduct modiﬁed versions of these surveys to track how these beliefs translate to COVID-19. In parallel, we have developed a compartmental population-based model of COVID-19, which models transmission and the effects of NPI intensity and timing on both health and economic outcomes. We propose to extend our current compartmental PBM and build a new individual-level ABM, informed by longitudinal surveys. We will conduct a four-year longitudinal panel survey to construct an empirical behavioral model for decisions to socially distance, engage in transmission reduction measures (such as mask-wearing), and vaccinate. This information will be combined with our existing synthetic network data-set to enable us to build an individual level ABM of the spread of COVID-19 in a representative US city, integrated with our inﬂuenza ABM. This model will capture both how individual behaviors impact macro-level disease transmission and how inﬂuenza and COVID-19 could interact. Insights and data from our individual-level model will be used to inform and parameterize adaptive behavior within our compartment-level model, allowing for policy comparisons across a range of US states. In addition, we will consider which policies are robust to key behavioral and technological uncertainties, such as the extent of behavior change in response to perceived risk and the timing and effectiveness of vaccines. Finally, we will develop web-based interactive tools that allow for the exploration and comparison of different policies in a variety of potential futures. Project Narrative The trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic is shaped by individual behavior. We propose the development of new transmission models of COVID-19 and seasonal inﬂuenza that study the interplay between individual behavior and transmission dynamics, while considering important uncertainties, such as seasonal effects and the loss of immunity. Building on our prior work on vaccination behaviors for inﬂuenza and the transmission of COVID-19, these models will be informed by tailored longitudinal surveys, observed behavior, and case data from the ongoing pandemic, and we will develop tools that run our models and allow users to identify the effects of behavioral factors on policy effectiveness, evaluate the potential impact of vaccine availability, and identify strategies that are robust to a wide range of uncertainties.",Modeling the Coupled Dynamics of COVID-19 Transmission and Protective

"Next-generation clinical phenotyping and pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and voice tremor PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Laryngeal dystonia (LD) and voice tremor (VT) are hyperkinetic neurological disorders that significantly impair voice and speech production and negatively impact the patient’s quality of life, extending beyond speech motor alterations and often causing occupational disability and life-long social isolation. The standards of clinical care of LD and VT are not established; that is, the differential diagnostic criteria remain vague, leading to a high rate of misdiagnosis, whereas treatment is largely limited to temporary symptom management with botulinum toxin injections into the affected laryngeal muscles. One of the major causes of suboptimal clinical care of these patients is the limited understanding of their distinct clinical characteristics and neural pathophysiology. We propose a multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary Center research program that will focus on the delineation of unique clinical and pathophysiological features of LD and VT in order to establish the fundamental framework for the enhanced clinical management of these disorders, including their accurate diagnosis and disorder-specific therapies. The Center research goals will be accomplished through collaborative clinical research studies at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Massachusetts General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, and University of Utah, which will include three Center Projects, a Scientific Core that incorporates the Clinical Research and Data Science components, and an Administrative Core that provides an overall organizational infrastructure to the Center activities. The overall Specific Aims of this Center will be (1) Characterization of clinical phenotypes of LD and VT; (2) Understanding disorder-specific neural pathophysiology in LD and VT; (3) Deep brain stimulation in LD and VT, and (4) Machine-learning platforms for differential diagnosis of LD and VT. We expect that our cross-disciplinary and collaborative Center, encompassing the expertise in otolaryngology, speech-language pathology, neurology, neurosurgery, brain and larynx imaging, invasive neurophysiology, and clinical neuroscience and applying complementary multimodal methodologies across these fields, will have a significant positive impact on developing new knowledge about the links between symptomatology and pathophysiology of LD and VT, which will help define the new standards of enhanced clinical care of these disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall goals of this Center are to (1) identify integrated features of clinical, behavioral and neural characteristics that reflect overlapping and distinct pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and voice tremor, and (2) develop predictive analytics for differential diagnosis of these disorders. This research is relevant to public health because it is expected to advance the understanding of the disorder pathophysiology and help define new approaches for their clinical management. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Next-generation clinical phenotyping and pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and voice tremor,10340118,P50DC019900,"['Affect ', ' Botulinum Toxins ', ' Botulin ', ' Clostridium botulinum Toxins ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' California ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dystonia ', ' Muscle Dystonia ', ' Ear ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laryngeal muscle structure ', ' Laryngeal Muscles ', ' larynx muscle ', ' Larynx ', ' Laryngeal ', ' Larynx Head and Neck ', ' voice box ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurology ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Otolaryngology ', ' otorhinolaryngology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social isolation ', ' Spasm ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Acoustics ', ' Speech-Language Pathology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Tremor ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Spastic Dysphonias ', ' Laryngeal dystonia ', ' spasmodic dysphonia ', ' Essential Tremor ', ' Benign Essential Tremor ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Occupational ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' treatment planning ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' research study ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Stratification ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical care ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' symptomatology ', ' Injections ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical examination ', ' clinical exam ', ' ']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,P50,2021,2478460
"Quantifying heterocellular communication and spatial intratumoral heterogeneity from high dimensional spatial proteomics data The tumor microenvironment (TME) is composed of malignant and non-malignant cells, each contributing to spatial intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and heterocellular communication altering the composition and architecture of the TME. A high degree of ITH is correlated to metastatic progression and therapeutic response. Previous studies investigating spatial ITH have been limited due to a steep trade-off between cellular resolution, spatial context, and dimensionality of biomarkers. A recent explosion of multi to hyperplexed imaging modalities (e.g., fluorescence imaging, mass-spec imaging) enable the quantiﬁcation of greater than 7 and up to > 100 biomarkers through sequentially multiplexed imaging of 2 to 3 biomarkers using iterative cycles of label-image-dye inactivation. The generation of this new type of data poses both unique opportunities and challenges. There are no state-of-the-art methods for harnessing the complexity of spatial data to infer tumor biology with a high dimensionality of biomarkers. In this project, we will probe the spatial complexity of a TME in hyperplexed immunofluorescence (HxIF) based spatial proteomics colorectal carcinoma (CRC) data (51 biomarkers + DAPI, 356 patient samples) to elucidate the heterocellular communication networks promoting spatial ITH through cellular phenotyping, microdomain extraction, and network biology inference algorithms. We will demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms to cancer types beyond CRC with multiplexed immunofluorescence breast cancer tissue samples  In Aim 1, we will continue to develop unsupervised learning algorithm for cellular phenotypic heterogeneity (LEAPH) to identify specialized, rare, and transitional cell populations. Initial results applying LEAPH on the HxIF CRC data have revealed cellular heterogeneity patterns consistent with CRC literature (STEM cell differentiation, immune evasion, macrophage evolution). We will incorporate machine learning- based methods into LEAPH to measure spatial distribution patterns of each phenotype and correlate them with CRC progression (e.g., recurrence). In Aim 2, we will quantify spatial ITH in greater detail by identifying differentially expressed pair- or group-wise spatial relationships based on outcome data (e.g., recurrence vs no-recurrence within 5 years) to reveal phenotypic domains, microdomains, with prognostic potential. We expect improvement of prognostic power with pair- or group-wise spatial interactions in comparison to the single-phenotype based spatial ITH characterization of Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will dissect the microdomain- specific heterocellular communication dynamics with causal inference network models. We expect to identify emergent signaling networks conferring malignant phenotypes, such as known features from CRC consensus molecular subtypes. The algorithms constructed in this project will be implemented and disseminated through the Tumor Heterogeneity Research Interactive Visualization Environment (THRIVE), an open source tool to assist cancer researchers in interactive hypotheses testing and guiding the design of therapeutic strategies. The recent explosion of next-generation, high-content, high-throughput spatial imaging technologies for intact tissues measuring protein expressions, DNA and RNA probes has attracted the interest of NIH and other international agencies in funding precision medicine efforts (e.g., HTAN, IOTN, HuBMAP, HCA, HPA).

"DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API. The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1]. Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets (listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules: (1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2) DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values, and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line, Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites, proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed? How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time? Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domain-agnostic data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration). Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular, will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the Standards component to maximize success.

"Validation and early development of a blood-based rapid diagnostic test for sepsis endotypes ABSTRACT Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory condition, occurs as a complication of infection and in severe cases may be associated with acute and life-threatening organ dysfunction. In the US alone, sepsis claims ~270,000 lives each year among ~1.7 million patients diagnosed annually, and globally, sepsis-related mortality is estimated to account for 20% of total deaths. Although improvements in the treatment protocol for sepsis and timely administration of antibiotics have reduced mortality rates, not a single drug for sepsis has ever been successfully brought to market, despite over 100 interventional trials, and it is treated today as 60 years ago: antibiotics and supportive care. Sepsis is unusual in that a great deal of the immune response is actually adaptive (beneficial) vs. disease-causing (maladaptive), so reversing the inflammatory response can cause the infection to go unchecked. We believe that a treatment should reverse the maladaptive (organ-damaging) components of the immune response, while keeping the adaptive (pathogen-fighting) components intact. We believe that to achieve impactful progress, new approaches are required that harness immune sub-groups. In this project, we propose a precision medicine approach to subdivide sepsis patients into treatable subclasses or “endotypes” using a companion diagnostic test, HostDx-Endotypes. We anticipate that classifying sepsis patients into such endotypes may allow us to identify improved treatment regimens, leading to the discovery of new targets or pathways for endotype-specific therapies and/or repurposing of available drugs. In Phase 1 work we already demonstrated proof-of-concept by identifying 3 sepsis endotypes (Inflammopathic, Adaptive, and Coagulopathic) and validated across multiple external data sets. We have shown that our HostDx Endotypes can stratify patients into novel, potentially treatable subgroups across 3 publications using several retrospective cohorts, and two prospective cohorts. We have also demonstrated the clinical utility of this paradigm with InSepTM, our robust classifier for acute infectious disease, based on our HostDx point of care test system platform. To bridge our proof-of-concept work to product development for HostDx-Endotypes, we will (Aim 1) employ rigorous machine learning algorithms and processes to finalize and lock an optimal classifier; (Aim 2) apply an innovative approach of drug repurposing to identify and rank-order endotype-specific drug candidates for clinical studies on sepsis treatment, and (Aim 3) translate the final mRNA panel to Inflammatix’s qLAMP cartridge and platform. At Phase II completion we will have produced the HostDx Endotypes research-ready cartridge, together with a list of repurposed drugs for intended clinical trials, and will be ready to enter the formal product development phase; we will have initiated the FDA pre-submission. Ultimately, the goal of this product will be to definitively link a patient sepsis endotype with a therapeutic intervention, to enable better therapy selection and resource allocation. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a significant public health crisis, but despite over 100 interventional drug trials, effective sepsis treatments have proven elusive; emerging data suggests that this may be related to immune sub-groups of sepsis, wherein some components provide beneficial responses, while others are disease-causing. Inflammatix believes that to achieve impactful progress, new approaches are required that harness these immune sub- groups, and our proposed HostDx-Endotypes test offers a precision medicine approach that would subdivide sepsis patients into treatable subclasses or “endotypes”. This point-of-care cartridge-based blood test will enable clinicians to make timely and precise determinations of sepsis endotype that would definitively link a patient sepsis endotype with a therapeutic intervention, to enable better therapy selection and resource allocation.",Validation and early development of a blood-based rapid diagnostic test for sepsis endotypes,10324978,R44GM142428,"['Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Complication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Infection ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Safety ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Cohort Analysis ', ' Cohort Analyses ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' fighting ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Immunomodulation ', ' immune modulation ', ' immune regulation ', ' immunologic reactivity control ', ' immunomodulatory ', ' immunoregulatory ', ' immunoregulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' drug action ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Sepsis ', ' blood infection ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' product development ', ' drug candidate ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' clinically actionable ', ' companion diagnostics ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' genetic signature ', ' gene signatures ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' septic patients ', ' sepsis patients ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning classifier ', ' Phase I/II Clinical Trial ', ' Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial ', ' Rapid diagnostics ', ' drug repurposing ', ' repurposing agent ', ' repurposing medication ', ' rapid test ', ' rapid assay ', ' rapid tests ', ' biomarker signature ', ' point of care testing ', ' ']",NIGMS,"INFLAMMATIX, INC.",R44,2021,677117
"Differential diagnosis of Parkinson's and multiple system atrophy in non-human primate models using a novel a-synuclein retinal contrast agent and AI-assisted analytics Project Summary Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease, and a major cause of disability in individuals over 65 years of age. PD belongs to a spectrum of diseases termed the “synucleinopathies”, defined by the progressive aggregation of insoluble fibrillary a-synuclein, and includes other disorders such as multiple system atrophy and Lewy body dementia. Currently, there are no objective tests that can be used to definitively diagnose PD. In addition, differential diagnosis of synucleinopathies is very challenging and relies heavily on a physician's clinical evaluation. A critical goal in the field is to reliably identify synucleinopathies at early, asymptomatic stages of the disease, to allow the best chance for correct disease modifying or preventative treatments to be effective. This proposal aims to develop a small molecule fluorescent retinal contrast agent as a novel diagnostic for PD and other related synucleinopathies. Project Narrative Parkinson’s disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are age-related synucleinopathies defined by the presence of α-synuclein deposits.

"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder.

Though the most effective treatment, prolonged levodopa use leads to 1) the debilitating side effect, levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), and 2) diminished levodopa efficacy which leads to fluctuations of PD symptoms, known as “wearing-off”. These concerns are two of the greatest unmet needs in PD and affect how doctors prescribe dosages and treatment options, impacting the efficacy of the necessary medications for PD. After 5 years of levodopa usage, 40% of PD patients will develop LID and/or fluctuations. Not only having a clinical impact, but PD patients with such complications require nearly $60,000 of additional therapeutics every year. Using Sinopia Biosciences’ computational platform, we studied gene expression changes due to levodopa administered to 6-OHDA lesioned PD-like mice. Applying our computational workflow, we identified a small molecule (SB-0107) that was selected based on: 1) having one of the top scores from our platform, 2) its novel mechanism of action, 3) previous clinical exposure to elderly patients, 4) its predicted CNS penetration properties, and 5) its potential for patent protection. Subsequently, we demonstrated the compound’s unique and potentially transformative pharmacology for treating both the symptoms of PD and complications of levodopa (i.e. LID). In both rodent and primate models, SB-0107 shows large effect sizes. Further, we observed in a cognitive deficit primate model of PD that SB-0107 improves performances in the tested cognitive tasks. Thus, SB-0107 represents a promising candidate for advancement to the clinic for PD. In this Fast-Track proposal, we will advance the compound by completing preclinical development studies for anticipation of IND submission. Project Narrative Levodopa is the primary treatment for Parkinson’s Disease, a neurodegenerative disease that afflicts 1 million Americans. Unfortunately, levodopa has serious side effects and loses its efficacy over time. Using Sinopia Biosciences’s computational drug discovery platform, we identified a small molecule that we subsequently tested and validated in relevant rodent and primate models, providing a unique mechanism for treating Parkinson’s Disease. This proposal will complete preclinical drug development for this compound in order to advance to the clinic.",Preclinical development of a novel therapeutic for Parkinson's disease,10324284,R44NS124398,"['Affect ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Climacteric ', ' life change ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Germany ', ' Gold ', ' Half-Life ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Levodopa ', ' L-Dopa ', ' Literature ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Liver Microsomes ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Safety ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Oxidopamine ', ' 6-OHDA ', ' 6-hydroxydopamine ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Funding ', ' Agonist ', ' MPTP Poisoning ', ' 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine Poisoning ', ' MPTP Neurotoxicity Syndrome ', ' MPTP injury ', ' MPTP lesion ', ' MPTP lesioning ', ' MPTP neurotoxicity ', ' MPTP toxicity ', ' MPTP-Induced Parkinsonism ', ' toxic effects of MPTP ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' mGluR4 ', ' metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' drug discovery ', ' Neural Stem Cell ', ' neural precursor ', ' neural precursor cell ', ' neural progenitor ', ' neural progenitor cells ', ' neuron progenitors ', ' neuronal progenitor ', ' neuronal progenitor cells ', ' neuronal stem cells ', ' neuroprogenitor ', ' nerve stem cell ', ' small molecule ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Pre-clinical Drug Testing/Development ', ' Preclinical Drug Testing/Development ', ' pre-clinical drug development ', ' Preclinical Drug Development ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Cardiac ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' preclinical efficacy ', ' pre-clinical efficacy ', ' candidate selection ', ' L-DOPA induced dyskinesia ', ' Levodopa dyskinesia ', ' levodopa induced dyskinesia ', ' Secure ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive task ', ' symptom treatment ', ' symptomatic treatment ', ' treat symptom ', ' motor symptom ', ' efficacy study ', ' clinical development ', ' preclinical development ', ' pre-clinical development ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' side effect ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2021,539778

"Antibody repertoire characterization in the context of coronaviruses Project Summary. SARS-CoV-2, or the 2019 novel coronavirus, is a significant pandemic threat that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of diagnosed cases and tens of thousands of mortalities as of March 2020. The development of preventive and therapeutic measures that can counteract the ongoing, and any future, coronavirus pandemics is therefore of utmost significance for public health worldwide. The S protein is the immunodominant region of coronaviruses (CoV) recognized by the immune system and serves as the target for a number of neutralizing antibodies. Passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies has been shown to prevent coronavirus infection in animal models. Further, engineered prefusion-stabilized S protein immunogens have been shown to elicit high titers of coronavirus-neutralizing antibodies in animal models, in the context of MERS. Together, this prior work establishes a strong premise for targeting the identification and characterization of neutralizing antibodies in the context of SARS-CoV-2. More generally, a better understanding of the human antibody response to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other related CoV members can help inform therapeutic antibody optimization and accelerate vaccine design efforts.  Our laboratory recently developed the LIBRA-seq technology (LInking B-cell Receptor to Antigen specificity through sequencing) for antibody discovery and characterization of antigen-specific antibody repertoires. Unlike other B cell approaches, LIBRA-seq is the first to enable the simultaneous determination of BCR sequence and antigen specificity for a large number of B cells against a theoretically unlimited number of diverse antigens, at the single-cell level. LIBRA-seq therefore provides a unique opportunity for characterizing the types and specificities of antibodies that can recognize the S protein from SARS-CoV-2, as well as other CoV viruses.  Here, we propose to utilize the LIBRA-seq technology in the context of SARS-CoV-2, with two major goals: (1) To identify cross-reactive antibodies that recognize multiple antigen variants associated with human coronavirus infection, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV, and (2) To evaluate the ability of current lead CoV vaccine candidates to engage with antibody repertoires from healthy individuals.  Taken together, the efforts proposed in this application will be of high potential translational/clinical impact for SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV pathogens of biomedical significance. The types of antibody repertoire characterization that we propose to develop here will also be readily generalizable to other pathogens, and as such, will have a broad and lasting impact on the development of countermeasures for established and emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative  The development of preventive and therapeutic measures that can counteract the ongoing, and any future, coronavirus pandemics is of utmost significance for public health worldwide. Here, we propose to focus on the identification of coronavirus-specific antibodies as potential countermeasures against coronaviruses, by utilizing a powerful antibody discovery technology recently developed by our group.

"Building protein structure models for intermediate resolution cryo-electron microscopy maps Project Summary Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an emerging technique in structural biology, which is capable of determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules. Compared to conventional structural biology techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and NMR, a major advantage of cryo-EM is its ability to solve large macromolecular assemblies. Moreover, recent technical breakthroughs in cryo-EM have enabled determination of 3D structures at nearly atomic-level resolutions. Cryo-EM will undoubtedly become a method of central importance in structural biology in the next decade. With the rapid accumulation of cryo-EM structure data, it has become crucial to develop computational methods that can effectively build and extract 3D structures of biological macromolecules from EM maps. The goal of this project is to develop computational methods for modeling both global and local structures and for interpreting 3D structures embedded in EM maps of around 4 Å to medium-resolution. Recently, we have developed a new de novo protein structure modeling method, MAINMAST, which can model protein structures from an EM density map without using existing template or fragment structures on the map. Based on the successful development of MAINMAST, we further extend the capability of MAINMAST toward more accurate modeling and for multiple-chain modeling. In addition, we will also develop novel modeling methods for medium-resolution EM maps, which combine a coarse-grained protein structure modeling technique, methods in protein structure prediction, and a low- resolution image processing approach with deep learning, a state-of-the-art powerful machine learning method. The proposed project capitalizes on the tremendous efforts and progress made in structural determination with cryo-EM by developing computational tools that allow researchers to perform efficient and reliable structure analyses for 3D EM density maps. The project will greatly facilitate investigation into the molecular mechanisms of macromolecule function by providing an efficient means of 3D structure modeling.

"Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1 PROJECT SUMMARY Previous studies showed discrepancies of health and behavior prevalence between American Indians (AI) population and other racial or ethnic groups. Most health surveys have certain limitations when studying AI population due to the small sample sizes for AI population. Data collected by AI Tribal Epidemiology Centers (TECs) provides an excellent opportunity to conduct research for AI population due to sufficient sample size and extensive information. However, most surveys conducted by TECs used non-probability sampling design (e.g. convenient sample) due to its lower cost and increased time efficiency. Non-probability sample may suffer from sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors without further proper adjustments. Such difficulties greatly hampers the analysis of AI population in health and behavior research. Our general hypothesis is that data integration by combining information from non-probability and probability samples can reduce sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors in original non-probability sample. The Goal of this project is to develop an accurate and robust data integration methodology for AI population analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research. During the past years, we have 1) studied data integration using calibration and parametric modeling approaches; 2) investigated machine learning and propensity score modeling methods in survey sampling and other fields; and 3) assembled an experienced team of multi-disciplinary team of experts. In this project, we propose to capitalize on our expertise and fulfill the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a data integration approach using machine learning and propensity score modeling We will develop machine learning and propensity score based data integration approaches to combine information from non-probability and probability samples. Compared to existing methods (i.e., Calibration, Parametric approach), our proposed approaches are more robust against the failure of underlying model assumptions. The inference is more general and multi-purpose (e.g. one can estimate most parameters such as means, totals and percentiles). Simulation studies will be performed to compare our proposed methods with other existing methods. A computing package will be built to implement the method in other settings. Aim 2. Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in AI health and behavior research We will use real data to validate the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to the various data types. The performance will also be assessed by comparing with results from existing data integration methods such as calibration and parametric modeling approaches. The planned study takes advantage of a unique data source and expands the impact of the Indian Health Service (IHS)-funded research. We expect this novel integration method will vertically advance the field by facilitating the analysis based on non-probability sample, which can provide in-depth understanding regarding the AI population health and behavior studies. Project Narrative The overall goal of this R21 project is to develop an accurate, robust and multi-purpose data integration methodology for AI population (non-probability sample) analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research such as diabetes and smoking. The code implementing the proposed method will be released and is general enough to be applied to AI population studies of other fileds. The success of this study will vertically advance the field by facilitating the AI population analysis, which can provide a better guidance and new insights on the future precision personalized prevention and treatment of certain diseases.",Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1,10271402,R21MD014658,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Calibration ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Health Fairs ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Kansas ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Probability ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' data quality ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' BRFSS ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' tribe health ', ' tribal health ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Behavioral ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' cluster computing ', ' data grid ', ' datagrid ', ' distributed computing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy development ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' population health ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' individualized prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R21,2021,109613
"Fast and flexible Bayesian phylogenetics via modern machine learning Project Abstract/Summary The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic underlines both our susceptibility to and the toll of a global pathogen outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes provides key insight into disease pathophysiology, spread and po- tential control. However, if these methods are to be used in a viral control strategy they must reliably account for uncertainty and be able to perform inference on 1,000s of genomes in actionable time. Scaling Bayesian phylogenet- ics to meet this need is a grand challenge that is unlikely to be met by optimizing existing algorithms.  We will meet this challenge with a radically new approach: Bayesian variational inference for phylogenet- ics (VIP) using ﬂexible distributions on phylogenetic trees that are ﬁt using gradient-based methods analogous to how one efﬁciently trains massive neural networks. By taking a variational approach we will also be able to integrate phylogenetic analysis into very powerful open-source modeling frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. This will open up new classes of models, such as neural network models, to integrate data such as sampling location and migration patterns with phylogenetic inference. These ﬂexible models will inform strategies for viral control.  In Aim 1 we will develop the theory necessary for scalable and reliable VIP, including subtree marginal- ization, local gradient updates needed for online algorithms, convergence diagnostics, and parameter support estimates. We will implement these algorithms in our C++ foundation library for VIP. In Aim 2 we will develop a ﬂexible TensorFlow-based modeling platform for phylogenetics, enabling a whole new realm of phylogenetic models based on neural networks to learn phylodynamic heterogeneity with minimal program- ming effort. We will provide efﬁcient gradients to this implementation via our C++ library. In Aim 3 we will use the fact that VIP posteriors are durable and extensible descriptions of the full data posterior to enable dynamic online computation of variational posteriors, including divide-and-conquer Bayesian phylogenetics. This work will enable a cloud-based viral phylogenetics solution to rapidly update our current estimate of the posterior distribution when new data arrive or the model is modiﬁed. 1 Project Narrative We have seen in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as for all major pathogen outbreaks in the last decade, how phylogenetic (i.e. evolutionary tree) methods are required to use viral genomic information to under- stand large-scale transmission patterns. However, current phylogenetic methods have two major limitations as a tool for viral control: ﬁrst, rigorous Bayesian probabilistic methods cannot scale to 1,000s of genomes, and second, models incorporating phylogenetic trees must be expressed in specialized phylogenetics pack- ages, making modern machine-learning approaches impossible. In this proposal, we develop variational ap- proaches to phylogenetics, which will allow fast inference and procedures to rapidly update inferences when new data arrives, as well as making phylogenetic trees a ﬁrst-class inferential object in major machine-learning packages. 1",Fast and flexible Bayesian phylogenetics via modern machine learning,10266670,R01AI162611,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Genome ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' Work ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' theories ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo computational algorithm ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo method ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo technique ', ' Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Update ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Modification ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' scale up ', ' pathogen ', ' migration ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' mathematical algorithm ', ' math algorithm ', ' mathematic algorithm ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' mathematical methods ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' cloud based ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' viral transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' high dimensionality ', ' TensorFlow ', ' neural network ', ' viral genomics ', ' virus genomics ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID crisis ', ' COVID epidemic ', ' COVID pandemic ', ' COVID-19 crisis ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID-19 global health crisis ', ' COVID-19 global pandemic ', ' COVID-19 health crisis ', ' COVID-19 public health crisis ', ' COVID19 crisis ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 global health crisis ', ' COVID19 global pandemic ', ' COVID19 health crisis ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' COVID19 public health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis ', ' SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 epidemic ', ' SARS-CoV2 pandemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic ', ' Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis ', ' coronavirus disease crisis ', ' coronavirus disease epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease pandemic ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis ', ' severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic ', ' ']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,797370
"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and

"Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology and to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation therapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory effects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across multiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and animal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of projects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT (HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and durvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast carcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the mechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining dendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of resistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in Projects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a state-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to drive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer. Overall Narrative Our goal is to demonstrate that the immune stimulatory effects of radiation therapy (RT) can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with CTLA-4 and PD-1 across multiple histologies. Our approach involves two immediate clinical trials, mechanistic studies in human samples, mechanistic and discovery studies in mouse models, and sharing of data and scientific insight between 3 Projects and 3 Cores. The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and

"Collaborative multi-site project to speed the identification and management of rare genetic immune diseases Summary  The subject of this proposal is a new, collaborative approach to improve the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). These patients have individually rare, monogenic disorders leading to severe infections, autoimmunity, and inflammation. The prevalence of PIDs is ~1:10,000 and approximately half have antibody deficiencies as their main immunological phenotype. Most doctors are unaware of these diseases and many patients go years without a diagnosis, costing the system tens of thousands of dollars per patient yearly and unnecessarily increasing morbidity and mortality. There is a tremendous, untapped opportunity to advance the diagnosis of patients with PIDs.  We propose to utilize new machine-learning approaches to algorithmically identify patients with PIDs from their electronic health records (EHR). To accomplish our goals, we have built a coalition of computational genomics groups at UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt (Computational team), and clinical immunology groups at the five University of California medical centers (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Irvine, San Diego, and Davis) (Immunology team). We propose to: Identify patients with rare immune diseases by phenotype risk scoring (Aim 1). We will speed the identification of patients with rare immune diseases by surveilling the EHR using a phenotype risk scoring approach, building upon recently published work in Science. We will apply this approach to the UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt clinical data repositories to identify potential cases. We will improve risk scoring by considering gender, age, and race/ethnicity. We will classify patients by whether they have an infection phenotype or immune dysregulation phenotype. Subsequently, we will expand to the larger, UC Health-wide Data Warehouse (UCHWDW), entailing 15+ million patients across all UC medical centers. We will then Identify the genetic immune diseases for these newly found subjects (Aim 2). We will follow the state-of-the-art approach employed by the UCLA and Vanderbilt Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) sites. We will start by sequencing all the known antibody deficiency patients across the Immunology team sites while collaboratively pre-reviewing identified cases from Aim 1 on monthly video-calls. For selected subjects, we will perform whole genome and RNA sequencing. Clinical and research laboratory testing will bring closure to the diagnostic odyssey for these subjects.  The overall impact of this work accelerates the diagnosis and cure of PIDs. This project will also serve as a demonstration of how immunology sites can work together sharing electronic medical records and genomic data to advance care. Narrative A major challenge for patients with immune diseases is the delay in diagnosis that leads to morbidity and mortality. This proposal combines teams from the five medical centers of the University of California and Vanderbilt to apply advanced computational, machine-learning approaches to identify patients with genetic immunodeficiency diseases.

"Inverted Spectroscopic Infrared Microscope (ISIM) for High Throughput Multi-Dimensional Cell Assays Abstract The goal of this research is to develop a novel spectroscopic cellular assay that will enable us to measure the real-time intra-cellular response of a cell to various extra-cellular stimuli. The uniqueness of our approach relies on several innovations. We will construct an Inverted Spectral Infrared Microscope (ISIM) based on Fourier- transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and combining it with a novel biosensor based on plasmonic nanostructures (metasurfaces). The biosensor will be integrated with multi-well plates to enable high- throughput. The proposed assay will detect biochemical and morphological changes of the cell, with the emphasis on the reorganization of the cellular membrane and its cytoskeleton. The multi-dimensional nature of the spectroscopic data will enable the application of machine learning techniques and improve its sensitivity in comparison with traditional one-dimensional real-time assays. To our knowledge, this will be the first real-time cellular assay that satisfies all of the four requirements below: (i) high throughput, (ii) multi-dimensionality of the collected time-dependent data, (iii) specific focus on biochemical changes of the cell, and (iv) focus on the changes occurring in close proximity of the cellular membrane. The assay will be validated using very common external stimuli of the cell, such as small-molecule compounds acting on G-protein coupled receptors. Relevance Statement: The goal of our program is to develop a novel multi-dimensional real-time cell assay. This will be accomplished by constructing an FTIR-based inverted spectral infrared microscope (ISIM) and combining it with a novel biosensor. The biosensor is based on the integration of plasmonic metasurface fabricated on an infrared-transparent glass with multi-well microtiter plates.

"Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models Project abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. A critical gap in the treatment of PD patients is that there is no clinically adopted method to predict an individual's progression rate. A predictor would enable the enrichment of disease modifying drug trials with fast progressors likely to show changes in the short duration of a clinical trial and enable a more informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops a composite biomarker of progression rate using the connectivity information provided by resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and deep learning. Deep learning (DL) is well suited to form predictive models because it learns both an optimal hierarchy of features and how to combine them for accurate prediction. In rs-fMRI the blood-oxygen level dependent signal can be analyzed to infer connectivity throughout the brain. Traditionally, connectivity has been computed as the correlation between average regional activation time courses. However correlation based connectivity is prone to inferring spurious connections due to its inability to distinguish indirect from direct connectivity and inability to distinguish bidirectional from unidirectional connectivity. A causal connectivity approach can discern these differences and thereby provide a more faithful characterization of the true neurobiological connectivity. The existing literature suggests connectivity, particularly causal connectivity, from rs-fMRI can inform the estimation of PD progression, but the attempt to predict progression rate with causal connectivity in a DL model is unique to this project.  This research develops several distinct approaches for building a progression rate predictor and apply them to three datasets including: the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) dataset, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's prospective imaging extension to the NINDS PBDP. In these studies, individual progression rates have been tracked over multiple years using multiple clinical measures. First, causal and correlative measures will be generated regionally and used with a DL model to create a baseline predictor of progression rate. Second, voxel- level causal measures will be generated as the increased granularity is expected to improve prediction accuracy. Third, since purely data-driven DL methods can be sensitive to dataset limitations, such as insufficient subjects and noise, these limitations will be addressed by developing a new structural connectivity regularization approach that constrains causal connectivity by the subject's own diffusion MRI. This regularization method will be general and likely applicable for building predictors for other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. This proposal will yield both DL models for predicting progression rate and a novel method to calculate constrained causal connectivity. All predictive models, composite neuroimaging biomarkers of progression rate and software will be publicly disseminated for ready incorporation by the scientific and clinical communities. Project narrative Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and this debilitating and incurable disease has no known cure. A cure for PD remains elusive due to the lack of clinically adopted predictors of progression rate, which if constructed would 1) hasten the discovery of disease modifying drugs by enriching clinical trials with fast progressors who likely will show changes over the trial, 2) allow for stratification of patients by progression rate in those trials, and 3) enable an informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops and validates distinct approaches to predict PD progression rate, identifies new biomarkers of progression rate, and yields a generalizable framework for constraining causal measures from fMRI with the subject's own structural connectivity that is readily repurposable for other neurological disorders with connectivity changes such as stroke and Alzheimer's.",Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models,10227044,F31NS115348,"['Adoption ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Florida ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Noise ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' progression marker ', ' progression biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' learning community ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' tractography ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', "" Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale "", ' MDS-UPDRS ', "" MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale "", ' UPDRS ', "" Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale "", ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2021,35546

"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,10134401,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biology ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Histone Deacetylase ', ' HDAC ', ' HDAC Proteins ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mucous body substance ', ' Mucus ', ' mucous ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ', ' CFTR ', ' CFTR Protein ', ' cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' success ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' Cell surface ', ' Proteome ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' HDAC7 ', ' mHDAC7 ', ' HDAC7 histone deacetylase ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Deacetylation ', ' HDAC Agent ', ' HDAC inhibitor ', ' Histone deacetylase inhibition ', ' Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' cystic fibrosis patients ', ' CF patients ', ' individuals with CF ', ' individuals with cystic fibrosis ', ' patients with CF ', ' patients with cystic fibrosis ', ' Population ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench to clinic ', ' loss of function ', ' spatial relationship ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' phenome ', ' phenomics ', ' epigenome ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' epigenetic profiling ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' genomic platform ', ' healthspan ', ' health-span ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' ']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,483750
"AI-driven biomarker analysis of intact whole brains imaged at micron and sub-micron resolution Abstract. Whole-organ 3D immunohistochemistry is revolutionizing the field of neuroscience, enabling unprecedented insight into the distribution of neural cells and neurological markers throughout the brain in health and disease. LifeCanvas Technologies is at the forefront of the new field of spatial proteomics, providing a complete workflow for whole-organ preservation, tissue clearing, immunohistochemical labeling, and imaging. Nevertheless, an ongoing challenge for such studies is the need to rapidly, reproducibly and rigorously quantify terabyte-sized datasets from whole-organ imaging efforts. While progress has been made in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to enable detection of cellular and sub-cellular markers in neural tissue, one-size-fits-all algorithms are inadequate for analyzing complex, information-rich brain datasets due to varying biomolecular expression patterns (e.g. nuclear, cytoplasmic, membrane-bound) and region-specific heterogeneities in cell density and neural cell types. However, AI-driven algorithms targeting a subset of labeling patterns can be effective provided the availability of adequate training data. LifeCanvas Technologies LCT is optimally positioned to develop highly accurate algorithms serving a wide range of detection tasks through its access to high volumes of whole-organ image data containing a variety of label expression patterns via its Contract Research Organization and user base. LCT proposes to develop a data analysis program, SmartAnalytics, which will embed a suite of AI algorithms within a user-friendly software package to identify labeled cell locations and characterize morphological features across the whole brain at cellular and sub-cellular resolution. Specifically, LCT will use intact, 3D immunolabeled mouse brains to design AI algorithms to detect labeled cells imaged at cellular resolution and generate further algorithms for the segmentation of labeled features imaged at sub-micron resolution. Data from LCT’s Contract Research Organization and academic collaborations will be continually fed back to improve and expand the library of detection algorithms available within SmartAnalytics, and these developments will drive further customer adoption and enhancement of future versions of the software. SmartAnalytics will guide users through model application, quality-control testing, and the generation of output products such as figures and summary statistics. In summary, SmartAnalytics will be an evolving and user- friendly workflow execution program that enables neuroscientists to take full advantage of their 3D image data, driving new discoveries in brain function, development and disease. Narrative. The ability to readily and accurately quantify proteomic expression patterns that define neural cell- type specific distributions and morphologies across intact brains will enable unprecedented and unbiased insights into studies of brain function. LifeCanvas Technologies’ state-of-the-art tissue processing pipeline provides uniform clearing, labeling, and imaging of whole brains at cellular and sub-cellular resolution. By developing Artificial Intelligence algorithms to detect labeled cells and determine morphologies and by packaging these algorithms in a user-friendly software ‘SmartAnalytics’, LifeCanvas will enable neuroscientists to quantify image data and derive critical results towards a more complete understanding of brain function in development, health and disease.",AI-driven biomarker analysis of intact whole brains imaged at micron and sub-micron resolution,10139966,R43MH125512,"['cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' submicron ', ' sub micron ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' user-friendly ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biomarker-driven ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' terabyte ', ' algorithm development ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Astrocytes ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astroglia ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Cytoplasm ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein ', ' Astroprotein ', ' GFA-Protein ', ' GFAP ', ' Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein ', ' Glial Intermediate Filament Protein ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Institutes ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Organ Preservation ', ' Proteins ', ' Quality Control ', ' Rosaniline Dyes ', ' Fuchsins ', ' Magentas ', ' Triphenylmethane Aniline Compounds ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Cell Density ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Collaborations ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' extracellular ', ' Nuclear ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' neural cell body ', ' soma ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Proteomics ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' tissue processing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Contracts ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' ']",NIMH,"LIFECANVAS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2021,211920
"Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses The natural immune response to foreign pathogens involves a complex coordination of cells, including an adaptive response to select and secrete antibodies into circulation. Individuals who have recovered from a pathogenic infection retain immune memory and continue to circulate pathogen-specific antibodies. For many infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola, and poxviruses, antibodies with neutralizing activity to multiple viral strains have been discovered from human survivors. The discovered antibodies are highly valuable as potential biologic therapeutics for the broader population, as the antibodies have been naturally optimized to defend against human pathogens.  Efforts to discover antibodies from humans recovering from coronavirus infection are underway, SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but are hampered by the limitations of existing antibody discovery platforms. Current approaches require screening for live B cells actively producing pathogen-specific antibodies, which are sensitive to cell death and rarely found in blood. In contrast, antibody protein is stable and pathogen-reactive antibodies are abundant in serum. While protein is the ideal material to start with, characterization of polyclonal antibody (pAb) protein presents new challenges.  Recent advances in mass spectrometry and analysis have shown individual antibody candidates can be derived from affinity-purified pAb proteins when a sufficiently matched B-cell genetic antibody repertoire is provided. We aim to develop algorithms to supplant the need of a genetic antibody repertoire, and de novo identify antibody candidates from limited complexity pAb samples. This is achieved by improvements to de novo peptide sequencing using machine learning, and targeted assembly of specificity determining regions (CDR3s) and antibody frameworks using de Bruijn graphs. The proposed software will provide estimates of clonal diversity and candidate sequences that can be synthesized and tested for reactivity. In addition to addressing needs for infectious diseases, as demonstrated with an urgent unmet need to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the software also applies to clinical and biomedical research needs in autoimmune disease, and commercial interests in replacing polyclonal antibody reagents with highly reproducible monoclonal antibody equivalents. The antibody repertoire circulating in serum is the most active component to an immune response, yet is unable to be directly queried without aid from the genetic antibody repertoire from cells.

"Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention Abstract Pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, more commonly known as bedsores are a huge problem affecting 2.5 million patients every year in the US and causes 60,000 deaths every year. Pressures exceeding 32 mm of Hg in the bony prominences in the back of the patient body lead to bedsores. Despite the existing low air loss mattresses, alternating pressure mattresses and the state-of-the-art air fluidized beds, bedsores prevail, and its prevention remains a huge healthcare challenge. Current hospital protocol is to turn patient every two hours. This is very disturbing and cause of pain to a resting patient who is dealing with other co-existing health conditions besides bedsores. Caregivers and nurses must turn heavy patients around, which sometimes lead to hurting their backs in the process. When not performed adequately and frequently (every 2 hours) as required, it is considered as negligence of care and causes litigation against nursing homes and hospitals causing huge financial losses to them. We propose a compliant-mechanism- based mattress that will obsolete the current clinical protocol of nurses and caregivers having to turn the patient every two hours. It will operate with minimal power, make small clicking noise when changing from one stable state to another using amount of force required to open a desk drawer. This switching of states can be further automated and can include a simple counter for documented evidence of alternating pressure to support against litigation of negligent care. In specific aim 1, machine learning using trained neural network will determine the functional requirements of the mattress (e.g., optimal amplitude and pitch for the undulation of the pressure points) by conducting a cohort pressure profile study that involves a bed that intentionally applies pressure on resting bodies. In specific aim 2, ideal topology with pitch and amplitude of undulations discovered in aim 1 will be developed using FACT and optimized using BLOT to create a prototype bi-stable compliant-mechanism-based mattress as a new approach for shifting pressure points on a patient’s body. FACT is advanced technique using freedom and constraint topologies for topology synthesis of the mattress and BLOT provides boundary layer optimization of the topology. Proposed mattress is innovative, disruptive, affordable, lightweight, does not use noisy air pumps, has no leakage issues and will eliminate the scourge of bedsores in the existing immobile and aging population. Project Narrative Numerous currently marketed alternating pressure mattresses have not received recommendations from reviewers due to poor correlation and unconvincing outcomes for bedsore prevention. Our approach of using neural network based machine learning will bring a new methodical approach to discerning the pitch and amplitude of undulations required to prevent dead pressure zones that exceed safe pressure of 32 mm of Hg on the patient’s back, which is fundamental to preventing bedsores. This will further serve as input to designing the prototype compliant-mechanism-based mattress using the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) approach and the boundary learning optimization tool (BLOT) with end effect of developing an innovative mattress for preventing bedsores in the immobile and aging population.",Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention,10138288,R41NR019721,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pressure ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Beds ', ' Body Weight ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' decubitus ulcer ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Bedsore ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' pressure injury ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mattresses ', ' Methods ', ' Negligence ', ' Noise ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Recommendation ', ' Rest ', ' Shoulder ', ' Work ', ' Litigation ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Nursing Protocols ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' tool ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Molds ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Width ', ' Height ', ' cohort ', ' Scourge ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Network-based ', ' prototype ', ' aging population ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' Geometry ', ' Injections ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' ']",NINR,K MEDICAL LLC,R41,2021,251440
"Rule-based machine learning to address heterogeneity in high-dimensional survival data Project Summary In the post-genomic era, researchers are met with an abundance of data to analyze and interpret. Genome- wide association analyses (GWAS) often boast millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), alongside increasingly large epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic (multi-omic) and other data sets. While the current standard in genetic epidemiology emphasizes increased sample sizes, we propose that substantial progress can be made by developing improved methods to analyze the vast amount of multi-omic data that currently exists. A number of methodological challenges including dimensionality and the multiple testing burden have limited the success of many approaches thus far. Furthermore, only considering simple, linear associations leaves out the more likely scenario of complex genetic and multi-omic relationships driving risk and outcomes in common diseases. Heterogeneity is just one of the complex mechanisms that underlies disease risk and outcomes, but is arguably among the most difficult to model and detect. This project tackles this and other challenges in glioma, a highly heterogeneous cancer type. Improving upon available treatment strategies in cancer and glioma specifically will undoubtedly require a full characterization of genetic heterogeneity and epigenetic mechanisms. In addition to confronting the dimensionality of genetic and epigenetic data using a feature selection strategy that can detect both main effects and interaction and preserve heterogeneity, we will modify an existing method for detecting heterogeneity to accommodate censored survival data. First, in Aim 1, we will use simulated genetic survival data to establish the utility of a Relief-based feature selection algorithm in capturing complex genetic architectures (i.e., main effects, heterogeneity, and epistasis). We will compare it against standard approaches for high-dimensional feature selection of survival data. Aim 2 updates a learning classifier system (LCS), a type of rule-based machine learning that uses IF/THEN rules to model complex and heterogeneous problem spaces. To our knowledge, no LCS that handles censored survival data has been developed to date. After testing our survival LCS on simulated data and comparing it to standard survival methods, in Aim 3 we will implement it using somatic mutation and methylation data from the TCGA glioma dataset. Finally, as part of Aim 3, we will perform a pathway analysis using the LCS output in an effort to identify common biological pathways underlying heterogeneous associations. We will also utilize a network visualization tool to better understand interactions between features and provide a visual interpretation of the results. Findings from this project will lay the foundation for precision care and treatment of glioma. Our innovative approach to high-dimensional, heterogeneous survival data will be both generalizable and interpretable, qualities that are missing from current machine learning approaches. This project and the accompanying training plan undeniably provide an ideal setting to develop the skills and experience necessary to become and independent investigator at the forefront of genetic epidemiology and informatics. Project Narrative Current approaches to analyzing genetic and other large data sets fail to suitably model heterogeneity – a phenomenon where different mechanisms give rise to the same disease; these methods similarly struggle with capturing interactions and other complex patterns of association. A full characterization of this complexity is necessary to fully understand and predict risk and outcomes in common diseases. Using both simulated and publicly available survival data, this proposal will develop and evaluate a machine learning method for identifying important variables and making predictions in the context of complex associations.",Rule-based machine learning to address heterogeneity in high-dimensional survival data,10141575,F31LM013583,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alkylating Agents ', ' Alkylators ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cox Models ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' Epistasis ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' genetic epistases ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Glioma ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' Head ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histones ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Persons ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' genetic promoter sequence ', ' promoter sequence ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' temozolomide ', ' Temodal ', ' Temodar ', ' methazolastone ', ' forest ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research.

"Predicting Substance Use among Military Veterans with a Positive MST Screen: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Military sexual trauma (MST) is a serious and pervasive problem among military populations, affecting approximately 16% of military personnel and veterans [1]. Substance use disproportionately affects individuals with a history of MST. Individuals with (vs. without) a history of MST are twice as likely to misuse substances [2-4]. Substance use among military samples has been linked to higher rates of negative consequences across several domains (e.g., health, occupational, legal [5, 6]), including death (e.g., overdose [7], traffic accidents [8], suicide [7, 8]). Further, while understudied among individuals with a history of MST in particular, negative substance use outcomes have been shown to be more severe among trauma-exposed populations, including more severe clinical presentations and poorer treatment prognosis [9, 10]. These findings emphasize the importance of clarifying the association between MST and substance use among military populations. Despite the clinical relevance and public health significance of substance use among military populations, research in this area has relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional designs. Moreover, the vast majority of studies in this area have utilized traditional statistical methods, which are limited in scope and capabilities. These limitations have important clinical implications, as they restrict our ability to specify the exact nature and directionality of the relationship between MST and substance use, thereby affecting how findings are translated into prevention and intervention efforts. The proposed research aims to fill these critical gaps by utilizing the Army STARRS pre/post-deployment study, a large, prospective military dataset to: (1) explicate the directional relation between MST and substance use using a longitudinal dataset, and (2) employ machine learning methods to develop an algorithm to optimize detection of substance use in military personnel with a history of MST. These findings will assist in elucidating the etiology of substance use among this high-risk group, as well as provide a prediction model for clinical use to better target at-risk individuals in this population. This research project will take place within the Department of Psychology at the University of Rhode Island; an institution with a strong history and commitment to health behavior research and methodology. The applicant will have access to sponsors and consultants with expertise in MST, substance use, advanced methodology, and statistical analysis that will facilitate her career objectives to develop increased knowledge and proficiency in (a) sexual trauma (e.g., MST) and substance use in military veterans; (b) grant/manuscript development; (c) statistical and methodological capabilities (i.e., machine learning); and (d) big data. The proposed project uses a timely and innovative approach to advance science on the relation between MST and substance use in military personnel. Addressing substance use in this population is necessary to improve the health of our nation's veterans, and aligns with the mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Project Narrative Military sexual trauma (MST) is highly prevalent among military personnel and is associated with disproportionate rates of substance use. By explicating the directional relation between MST and substance use, and utilizing machine learning to develop high-quality prediction models for clinical use, the proposed study will inform prevention and intervention efforts for this high-risk group. Findings will be used to improve clinical outcomes among military personnel with exposure to MST, and reduce the onset and maintenance of problematic substance use and associated negative consequences.",Predicting Substance Use among Military Veterans with a Positive MST Screen: A Machine Learning Approach,10140573,F31DA051167,"['Traffic accidents ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health related behavior ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' military population ', ' Mission ', ' Overdose ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Medication ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Affairs ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Sexual Harassment ', ' Sexual Harrassment ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Distress ', ' sexual assault ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' sexual attack ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Occupational ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' high risk behavior ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' intervention for prevention ', ' prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' preventive intervention ', ' To specify ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' sexual trauma ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' substance misuse ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Service provision ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' military veteran ', ' veteran population ', ' military service ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,F31,2021,41003
"Development of a pipeline for parallel elucidation of protein structures Advances in biophysical technologies have accelerated our ability to probe the mechanisms of even the most complex cellular systems, and such studies have enabled researchers to design modifications to known protein structures and design completely new proteins. This “protein design” technology has given rise to an ability to manipulate protein structures as a means of improving on or introducing new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. The bases of these studies rely on computational modeling of protein candidates, although the accuracy of protein structure prediction, protein de novo design, and single-mutation effects prediction remain below the threshold for many use cases, such as structure-guided drug design and rational enzyme engineering. Thus, success of a protein engineering effort relies on high-resolution structure determination, which involves laborious screening and optimization in order to obtain stable proteins or active enzyme variants. However, our ability to observe protein structure using common structure determination strategies (X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)) lags far behind our ability to design and produce new sequences, creating a knowledge gap that prevents biochemists from accessing the range of protein functions seen in nature. While current technologies enable rapid synthesis of hundreds of proteins with varied sequences, there do not exist technologies for rapid structural characterization of these generated proteins. The ability to obtain high- resolution structural information for hundreds of sequences in parallel would provide invaluable insights in protein engineering methods. Importantly, rapid structure determination would enable structural characterization of genetic variation in the human genome underlying disease by enabling the structural and mechanistic interpretation of rare and de novo disease-related variants. Cryo-EM enables numerous high-resolution structures to be determined from a small amount of sample without requiring homogeneity, an aspect of this method that we plan to exploit for parallel elucidation of protein structures. We will establish the feasibility of this technique for rapidly investigate the structures of engineered protein libraries, where the molecular weight range is near or below the lower detection limit of cryo-EM. We will also probe the limits of our ability to identify the location and structural impact of tested mutations at limited structural locations, such as active sites. We will explore the feasibility of our parallel structure determination approach in two aims: Aim 1 will identify the limit of current single-particle analysis methods to discriminate between structurally similar protein complexes. Aim 2 will implement machine learning algorithms to push the current limits of classification using a combination of synthetic and real data. These exploratory studies will pave the way to rapid structure determination of multiple protein complexes from a single cryo-EM experiment, providing the ability to rapidly obtain high-resolution structures for many engineered proteins, thereby enabling unprecedented design and testing feedback cycles to help treat human disease. Narrative Our understanding of structure-function relationships has matured to the point that we can now manipulate the composition of proteins as a means of producing diagnostics or therapeutics for human disease. However, in order to fully elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of function that drive these protein design studies, structures of the designed proteins must be determined. However, structure determination is a massive bottleneck, which we plan to overcome by establishing a platform for massively parallelized structure determination of protein targets that is commensurate with the rate of protein production involved in protein design studies.",Development of a pipeline for parallel elucidation of protein structures,10231713,R21GM142196,"['Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' protein sequence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Crystallography ', ' Crystallographies ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Engineering ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Heart ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Weight ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Names ', ' Production ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Active Sites ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' particle ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Proteomics ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' protein complex ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Biochemical Process ', ' Data ', ' Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Protein Biochemistry ', ' Resolution ', ' Preparation ', ' Modification ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' human disease ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' screening ', ' variant of unknown significance ', ' unclassified variant ', ' variant of uncertain clinical significance ', ' variant of uncertain significance ', ' variant of undetermined significance ', ' Structural Protein ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' classification algorithm ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' de novo mutation ', ' de novo variant ', ' detection limit ', ' ']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2021,221875
"Deep learning and topological approaches to identify kidney tissue features associated with adverse outcomes after nephrectomy ABSTRACT Pathologic assessment of kidney biopsy tissue remains the best predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with kidney diseases. These features are largely independent of disease etiology and are not well reflected in non- invasive tests (e.g. serum creatinine and albuminuria). Quantitative assessment of these parameters is time consuming and maybe flawed by heterogeneity of pathologic features within kidney tissue. We propose to evaluate and optimize computational image analysis approaches to support pathologic analysis of large pieces of cancer-free kidney tissue from patients who underwent nephrectomy which we have collected (n > 220). Computer-assisted analysis of glomerular phenotypes in these samples show that morphometric features in glomeruli without obvious pathology precede established pathologic changes. We hypothesize that evaluation of cancer-free kidney tissue will inform about subclinical damage in the remaining kidney which is associated with relevant pathologic and clinical parameters. We propose to assess glomeruli, arteries and tubuli, and determine the spatial inter-relationship of the assessed features within the kidney tissue. The examination of significantly larger pieces of kidney tissue than those obtained by needle biopsy allows to include 20 times more glomeruli (nephrectomy samples: avrg. 256 glomeruli/sample; needle biopsy: avrg. 13/sample) with the vast majority considered “normal appearing” as per standard pathologic criteria. In addition, these samples include a significant larger number of blood vessels (nephrectomy samples: avrg. 18 arteries/sample; needle biopsy: avrg. 1/sample) allowing a more robust evaluation of the vasculature. We propose to apply and optimize our detection and segmentation approach to detect glomeruli, arteries and tubular segments to train convolutional neural networks and use topological image analysis to automate the identification of visual and sub-visual features. In addition, we will assess the spatial relationship between individual features (glomeruli, arteries and tubular segments and features of the same category, i.e. globally sclerosed glomeruli, arteries with hyalinosis, atrophied tubuli) within the section. To determine reproducibility of our approach, we will assess a second tissue section from a separate part of the same samples. Specifically, we propose an algorithmic detection and characterization of kidney features using deep learning, a topological image analysis for discovery of novel sub-visual features in kidney tissue images and to determine spatial relatedness of these features. If successful, we will validate our analytical approach in future independent studies. For this purpose, we are already prospectively collecting kidney tissue and longitudinal clinical data from consented patients undergoing nephrectomies, allowing association of specific features with clinical relevant outcomes. LAY NARRATIVE Patients who have one kidney removed because of cancer or other reasons, are at risk of experiencing kidney failure after the surgery due to damage to the remaining kidney, but it is difficult to know why the kidney fails and how to prevent or treat it. Evaluation of kidney tissue is the best way to determine how strong or weak the kidney is at time of surgery and how to best manage kidney-related complications afterwards. We propose a detailed analysis of pieces of tissue not affected by the tumor from the removed kidney using advanced computer-assisted analysis methods (“convolutional neural networks” and “topological image analysis”) to more accurately evaluate the status of the kidney, predict what will happen to the kidney function in the future and thereby guide therapy.",Deep learning and topological approaches to identify kidney tissue features associated with adverse outcomes after nephrectomy,10229784,R21DK126329,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arteries ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Creatinine ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetic Nephropathy ', ' Diabetic Kidney Disease ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Glomerulonephritis ', ' Bright Disease ', ' Heymann Nephritis ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Needles ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Nephrotic Syndrome ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' glomerulosclerosis ', ' glomerular sclerosis ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' kidney imaging ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Tubular ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' Scanning ', ' Contralateral ', ' Distant ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' interstitial ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Sampling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' user-friendly ', ' spatial relationship ', ' tumor ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' histological stains ', ' histologic stains ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal biopsy ', ' renal damage ', ' damage to kidney ', ' kidney damage ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2021,234000
"A data-driven approach towards generation of permeable peptide therapeutics Project Summary  A staggering number of potential targets for combating diseases fall into a category called undruggable, targets that are not accessible to two commonly used drug modalites: antibodies and small molecules. These undruggable targets often reside inside the cells and cannot be accessed by antibodies, which are too large to cross the cell membrane. Their flat surfaces deviate from the common deep pockets that are often hit by small molecules. To untap the potential of these targets, we need a therapeutic modality that can target shallow pockets and cross the cell membrane. Peptides are at the size range and composition that can be an ideal choice as this alternative modality.  Despite efforts in developing high affinity peptide binders, generating permeable binders has been a long-standing challenge. The few examples of cell permeable functional peptides are often developed through error and trial or via many rounds of modification and testing. The challenge in obtaining permeable binders is mainly due to lack of high throughput methods to screen for permeability, which has not only limited the power of library-based screening for obtaining permeable binders, but has also resulted in a limited amount of experimental data from which one can deduce rules that govern a peptide permeable. Thus, the use of peptides as therapeutics to drug the undruggable has remained largely underdeveloped.  This proposal uses an interdisciplinary approach to address this challenge. We generate a network to represent the peptide space in a meaningful manner. We then cluster this network and select for experimental testing a set that is truly representative of the peptide space. The results of our tests, which include both artificial membrane analysis and cellular uptake in bacterial and mammalian cells, can thus be generalized to the entire space. This unprecedented dataset will then be used as a starting point to gain better understanding of peptide permeability and to develop experimental and computational methods for rapid identification of permeable peptide binders that can be used as leads for therapeutic development. We will use this dataset to develop an automated generative algorithm that computationally designs permeable peptides that can target a target interface of interest.  This proposal is a leap in the field of peptide therapeutic development. The dataset generated during this work and methods we develop will be the stepping stone for many researchers interested in drug discovery, physics-based models of permeability, and peptide therapeutics. Project Narrative  A large portion of potential drug targets are inaccessible to the most widely used therapeutic modalities: small molecules and antibodies. Peptides are powerful alternatives for drugging these targets; however, their use has been hugely underexplored due to challenges in the way of obtaining cell-permeable peptides that can access intracellular targets. In this proposal, we use a novel data-driven approach that combines state-of-the-art computational techniques, such as peptide design and machine learning, with experimental data generation to develop methods and datasets that will pave the way for the development of next generation cell-permeable peptide therapeutics.",A data-driven approach towards generation of permeable peptide therapeutics,10241206,DP2GM146249,"['Antibodies ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Libraries ', ' Artificial Membranes ', ' Methods ', ' Peptides ', ' Permeability ', ' Physics ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Surface ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' uptake ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' drug discovery ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' peptide drug ', ' therapeutic peptide ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,DP2,2021,1301850
"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10245285,R01HG010881,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genetic profiling ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' modifiable risk ', ' malleable risk ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical risk ', ' risk variant ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' genetic predictors ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' genetic information ', ' variant of unknown significance ', ' unclassified variant ', ' variant of uncertain clinical significance ', ' variant of uncertain significance ', ' variant of undetermined significance ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' support tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' feedforward neural network ', ' feed forward neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' feature extraction ', ' data standards ', ' data standardization ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' ']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,761822
"A Preclinical Program for Targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis KasA ABSTRACT  We present herein a grant application focused on the late-stage development of preclinical candidate JSF-3285. Per our recently published research, we have disclosed the genesis of this program that led to the hit compound DG167 and identification of the essential β-keto acyl synthase KasA as its target. Building on this effort, our preliminary data detail the optimization to arrive at JSF-3285 which is efficacious in the acute and chronic models of M. tuberculosis infection in mice at doses as low as 5 mg/kg once-daily oral. This proposal seeks to build on this data by conducting the requisite drug combination and relapse studies to achieve clinical status and begin IND-enabling studies. In addition, we propose a second generation program based on preliminary data consisting of a structurally distinct amide series with promising in vitro efficacy, mouse PK, and X-ray structural data. The grant's second aim will evolve this series, leveraging our extensive X-ray structural data, SAR, and machine learning models, to produce at minimum novel early lead compounds if not compounds equal to or surpassing JSF-3285. The sum total of the two aims, featuring JSF-3285 and second generation candidate/s, will lend a high probability to a KasA inhibitor becoming clinically relevant in the next 5 years. PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT  This proposal will develop a new therapy that will help to cure drug-susceptible and drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis. It will also have the potential to reduce the length of time need to treat tuberculosis and inhibit new resistance from occurring.

"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation in assisting radiologists for tasks such as segmentation of cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data.

His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",10208938,K08HL141601,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Critical Care ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy Project Summary  Radiotherapy (RT) aims to deliver tumoricidal dose to clinical target volume (CTV) while sparing organs at risk (OAR), for which proton and photon beams are naturally complementary to each other: protons are generally better for OAR sparing, while photons are more robust to delivery uncertainties for CTV coverage. The hybrid proton-photon RT has a long history. However, as it generates proton and photon plans separately without fully utilizing joint proton-photon optimization during the planning stage, current hybrid RT is pseudo- hybrid and very limited in plan quality, treatment sites, and broad applicability. The key to leapfrog from pseudo-hybrid to truly-hybrid RT is new joint proton-photon optimization method that synergizes complementary proton and photon beams. The hypothesis is that truly-hybrid RT via appropriate joint proton- photon optimization will be more favorable than proton or photon-only RT, in terms of CTV coverage robustness and OAR sparing optimality.  Broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT to patients: (A) Clinical applicability: unlike pseudo-hybrid RT that is limited in plan quality and treatment sites, truly-hybrid RT may become a new paradigm for general cancer RT, owing to its superior plan quality and thus potentially clinical outcomes to proton-only or photon-only RT. (B) Clinical workflow: our truly-hybrid plans can be individually and safely delivered on existing proton and photon machines, and this effort envisions patients being treated in an integrated cancer center like ours with both proton and photon equipment, under the direction of a single physician, using shared immobilization devices, simulation procedure and structure set, and integrated treatment planning and delivery system. (C) Patient coverage: truly-hybrid RT can be made broadly available to many cancer patients through existing infrastructures in US, since (1) most hospitals with proton centers also have photon centers; (2) 76% of cancer patients live in the states with operational proton centers, while 85% are within 100-mile (2-hour-driving) distances to these proton centers; (3) cancer patients are more willing to travel for advanced treatment options.  Proposed effort: Inspired by unprecedented plan quality and broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT via our joint proton-photon optimization method, the next step is to test the hypothesis prospectively via clinical trials. However, a missing prerequisite to advance truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic is a treatment planning system (TPS) that can generate clinically-deliverable hybrid plans. To meet this urgent need, this effort will develop novel optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT, which is a radical step towards prospective clinical trials for testing the hypothesis.  Aim 1: Optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT.  Aim 2: Optimization methods for accurate and efficient MCO truly-hybrid planning.  Aim 3: Deep learning based optimization methods for efficient truly-hybrid planning. Project Narrative  This project will develop truly-”2D” proton-photon joint optimization methods for clinically-deliverable truly- hybrid RT with unprecedented superior plan quality to proton-only and photon-only RT, and first-of-its-kind TPS to bridge truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic. This hybrid TPS can facilitate prospective clinical trials of a broad spectrum of treatment sites for many patients. If succeed, truly-hybrid RT via this first-of-its-kind TPS will likely warrant improved clinical outcomes with reduced OAR toxicities, and potentially become a new paradigm for cancer RT in general, with compelling benefits in both treatment cost and clinical outcomes.",Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy,10207870,R37CA250921,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Equipment ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Immobilization ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Photons ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Cancer Radiotherapy ', ' cancer radiation therapy ', ' Dose ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Radiotherapy Research ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' treatment site ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,4193
"Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa Project Summary/Abstract Background: A major challenge in evolutionary genomics is to characterize the forces shaping present-day patterns of genetic variation. For instance, the extent and manner in which natural selection affects genetic diversity remains highly controversial. Researchers have largely addressed this problem by developing statistical tests or summaries of genome sequence variation that provide insights into the evolutionary forces at play. However, because such approaches typically rely on a single univariate summary of the data, valuable discriminatory information present in the original dataset is lost. A more fruitful strategy would thus be to use multidimensional summaries of genomic data (e.g. a large vector of summary statistics) or even the totality of the input data (e.g. a matrix-representation of a sequence alignment) to make more accurate inferences. An even more powerful approach is to utilize data sets in which the same population is sampled at multiple time points, allowing one to observe evolutionary dynamics in action. Although such genomic time-series data are becoming more prevalent, the development of appropriate computational methodologies has lagged behind the proliferation of such data. Proposal: The Schrider Lab seeks to develop and apply powerful machine learning methods for evolutionary inference. Our work over the next five years will yield powerful software tools leveraging novel representations of genomic datasets, including time-series data. These efforts will dramatically improve researchers' ability to make accurate evolutionary inferences from both population genomic and phylogenetic data. Indeed, preliminary results demonstrate that our methods vastly outperform current approaches in evolutionary genetics. More importantly, we will use these tools to answer pressing evolutionary questions. In particular, our use of time-series data will reveal loci responsible for recent adaptation with much greater confidence than currently possible. Our efforts will help to resolve the controversy over the role of adaptation in shaping patterns of diversity across the human genome. This research has important implications for public health as well, as genes underlying recent adaptations are enriched for disease-associations. Moreover, we are constructing a time-series dataset in the mosquito vector species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We will interrogate these data for evidence of recent and ongoing adaptation—this work will reveal loci responsible for the evolution of resistance to insecticides and other control efforts. Encouraging preliminary data also suggest that our work in phylogenetics will substantially improve inferential power in this important research area. More broadly, the success of the novel approaches described in this proposal has the potential to transform the methodological landscape of evolutionary genomic data analysis. Project Narrative The work proposed here seeks to develop and apply powerful machine-learning based software tools for evolutionary genetic inference in humans, mosquito vectors, and other species. Such efforts have important health implications, as they can identify genes involved in adaptation, which in humans are often associated with disease and in mosquitos are often associated with resistance to insecticides and other control efforts.",Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa,10207692,R35GM138286,"['Aedes ', ' Affect ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecticides ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' vector mosquito ', ' vector ', ' time use ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2021,382894
"Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation Project Summary: It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical princi- ples that govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as penetration of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or conformational rearrangements near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As a result, our understanding in factors that dictate the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of enzyme catalysis remains in- complete, especially regarding contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our ability to design highly efﬁcient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying mechanism of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to what degree the chem- ical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to develop an efﬁcient QM/MM framework to compute free energy proﬁles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of computational speed and accuracy; further integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning techniques and modern computational hardwares enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling be- tween the chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique position to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact of transient metal ion recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of peripheral membrane enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a transcription factor; an emerging research direction is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our project integrates computational method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental ad- vances, such as time-resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution. The research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory mech- anisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus the project will have both fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and allostery in biomolecules. Narrative: The computational methodologies we develop will be applicable to a broad set of metalloen- zymes and proteins of biomedical relevance. In particular, we target fundamental mechanistic problems in enzymes that catalyze nucleic acids synthesis/modiﬁcation and lipid metabolism, since mutations in these en- zymes are implicated in numerous human diseases such as cancer, insulin resistance and diabetes. Although our project does not focus on design of drugs, the mechanistic insights into enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation will broaden strategies that can be used to target various enzymes of biomedical signiﬁcance.",Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation,10206585,R35GM141930,"['Allosteric Regulation ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Catalysis ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Crystallography ', ' Crystallographies ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Drug Design ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Ions ', ' Metals ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Tweens ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' method development ', ' Peripheral ', ' Distal ', ' Penetration ', ' Active Sites ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' enzyme mechanism ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' fat metabolism ', ' lipid metabolism ', ' Speed ', ' Free Energy ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' human disease ', ' mutation screening ', ' mutation scanning ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R35,2021,295591
"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades.

"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",10203751,K01AI141616,"['Affect ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' anti-malarial agents ', ' anti-malarial drugs ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biomass ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' California ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Filarial Elephantiases ', ' Bancroftian Elephantiasis ', ' Lymphatic Filariasis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Insecticides ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Falciparum Malaria ', ' Plasmodium falciparum Malaria ', ' Maps ', ' Masks ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Namibia ', ' South West Africa ', ' Southwest Africa ', ' Onchocerciasis ', ' onchocercosis ', ' volvulosis ', ' Parasites ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' Poliomyelitis ', ' Acute Poliomyelitis ', ' Polio ', ' Public Health ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Smallpox ', ' Variola ', ' small pox ', ' variola major ', ' Swaziland ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trachoma ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' TB infection ', ' disseminated TB ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Zambia ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Interruption ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Modification ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Anti-malarial drug resistance ', ' Anti-malarial drug resistant ', ' Antimalarial drug resistance ', ' Antimalarial drug resistant ', ' anti-malarial resistance ', ' antimalarial resistance ', ' resistance to anti-malarial drug ', ' resistance to antimalarial drug ', ' resistant to anti-malarial drug ', ' resistant to antimalarial drug ', ' infectious disease model ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' chemotherapy ', ' trial comparing ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' malaria transmission ', ' low income country ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' ']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,146767
"Mouse Models of Human Cancer Database PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The laboratory mouse is the preeminent animal model system for investigation into the biology and genetics of human cancer. Mouse models have provided key insights into cancer susceptibility, the molecular genetics of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, and therapy response in pre-clinical and co-clinical studies. Human tumors engrafted into immune compromised and humanized mice (aka, Patient Derived Xenografts) are playing an increasingly important role as a powerful preclinical platform for testing new cancer treatments. The Mouse Models of Human Cancer (MMHC) database is a unique on-line compendium of mouse models for human cancer. MMHCdb provides electronic access to expertly curated and harmonized information on diverse mouse models for human cancer along with tools for accessing and visualizing associated data from these models. This in turn, facilitates the selection of appropriate strains of mice for cancer genetics research. MMHCdb integrates data derived from peer-reviewed literature and from direct submissions from researchers. Data in MMHCdb are also obtained from other bioinformatics resources including PathBase, HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature database, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress. In this proposal we describe our plans for the continued development of MMHCdb with an emphasis on expanded support for analysis of tumor genomic data and drug response data from Patient Derived Xenograft models. To accomplish these goals we will build on successful collaborations to develop data standards for PDX models that are now widely adopted. The major goals for the project renewal include the following: · continue to populate MMHCdb with data on strain-specific patterns of tumorigenesis in inbred, mutant, and  genetically engineered mice, · leverage collaborations with Seven Bridges and PDXNet to analyze genomic data for PDX models using a  common analysis pipeline, · develop a platform for the analysis of PDX genomic and drug response data, and · support the infrastructure of MMHCdb and our user community through ongoing database maintenance,  development of new software components, user support services, and community outreach activities.

"Long Acting Injectable Depots for TB Therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patient dosing adherence is often compromised by the complex pill regimes and long duration of current TB drug therapies. These challenges are exacerbated in settings for patients in many social and global settings where TB co-therapy with HIV positive patients is stigmatized. Long-acting drug delivery products should therefore play an important role to increase patient adherence and increase drug efficacy. This project will develop a new injectable depot technology that address a general target product profile that includes multiple-month delivery from a single injection, low volume and low viscosity formulations to reduce patient pain, combination drug formulation where required, sustained drug release with designable PK profiles, minimal initial and run-out burst release to increase safety and prevent drug resistance, and for global settings has low cost of goods and lowered cold-chain requirements. This depot technology also has the important translational product attributes of streamlined CMC and cGMP manufacturing that could lead to more rapid clinical development achievement. A new injectable depot product for TB therapy will be developed that is differentiated from current dispersal based formulation approaches by being a fully synthetic depot. The proposal is structured around 2 specific aims in the R61 phase and two further aims in the R33 phase: (1) Prodrug monomers made by synthetic chemistry are directly polymerized in a second synthetic step to create “drugamer” depot therapeutics that have the drugs built into the depot itself. Compared to current dispersion formulation approaches, the drugamers exhibit higher drug loading efficiencies, the ability to co-formulate drugs of different lipophilicities, and linear, individually tailorable PK profiles that minimize first- and last-week burst release. These PK profiles are kinetically controlled by the linker properties that are tied to the individual drugs, along with polymer architectural design. This aim will exploit a unique high throughput polymer library and screening platform at CSIRO Melbourne to identify lead injectable depot designs using bedaquiline and moxifloxicin as initial drug examples. Sophisticated LC-MS/MS PK characterization will assess the sustained PK profile together with PK/PK modeling. (2) Evolve and optimize depot lead candidates through efficacy in an initial TB model that allows higher throughput imaging characterization of activity. This will be followed by an Mtb model assessment and selection to a lead depot candidate; (3) Test and optimize the two lead drug depot candidates in an A/BSL3 Mtb model, by the criteria of PK/PD, efficacy and dose dependence, and dosing duration. The lead depot will also be characterized in accelerated stability studies to test whether they can avoid cold-chain storage. (4) Evaluate iterated up-selected depots in combination depots from mixing optimized bedaquiline and moxifloxacin depots, including dual PK profiling and PK/PD modeling. This same approach could also be expanded to develop future therapeutic products based on other combination drug depot designs. These favorable platform attributes motivate this this project as a potential new addition to the repertoire of anti-TB patient products. Project Narrative This project will provide TB therapy products that make patient adherence to monotherapy and combination drug therapy more effective. The new technology will provide drug dosing from a single injectable product that can be tailored to 2-3 month dosing from single injections. Patients will experience lower pain and the product will reduce the need for refrigeration to increase impact globally.",Long Acting Injectable Depots for TB Therapy,10236790,R61AI161820,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automation ', ' Chemistry ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Dimethyl Sulfoxide ', ' DMSO ', ' Demasorb ', ' Demeso ', ' Dimethylsulphinyl ', ' Dimethylsulphoxide ', ' Domoso ', ' Dromisol ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Combination Drug Therapy ', ' Polychemotherapy ', ' combination chemotherapy ', ' combination pharmacotherapy ', ' combined drug therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' Freeze Drying ', ' Freeze Dryings ', ' Lyophilization ', ' Future ', ' Cyclic GMP ', ' Guanosine Cyclic Monophosphate ', ' cGMP ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' M tb ', ' M tuberculosis ', ' M. tb ', ' M. tuberculosis ', ' mtb ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Polymers ', ' Powder dose form ', ' Powders ', ' Prodrugs ', ' Drug Precursors ', ' Pro-Drugs ', ' Refrigeration ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Solubility ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Viscosity ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Weight ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Injectable ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Cold Chains ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' therapy duration ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Moxifloxacin ', ' experience ', ' monomer ', ' solid state ', ' drug efficacy ', ' lipophilicity ', ' Structure ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' HIV therapy ', ' pill ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Polymer Chemistry ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Virulent ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' biosafety level 3 facility ', ' BSL-3 facility ', ' BSL3 facility ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Implant ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' tuberculosis drugs ', ' Antitubercular Drugs ', ' TB drugs ', ' anti-TB drugs ', ' anti-tuberculosis drugs ', ' antituberculosis drugs ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' product development ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' co-infection ', ' coinfection ', ' Formulation ', ' HIV/TB ', ' HIV/Mtb ', ' HIV/mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' HIV/tuberculosis ', ' M. tuberculosis/HIV ', ' clinical development ', ' Injections ', ' lead candidate ', ' chronic infection ', ' persistent infection ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' drug release profile ', ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' PK/PD ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R61,2021,686389
"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals. These novel ultrasound techniques will be initially applied to improve liver imaging in overweight and obese patients in a pilot study, though the benefits of this new high-quality imaging technology will extend to all other areas of clinical ultrasound imaging.",Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients,10236260,R01EB027100,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Noise ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' improved ', ' liver imaging ', ' liver scanning ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Lesion ', ' Subcutaneous Tissue ', ' Hypodermis ', ' Subcutis ', ' Superficial Fascia ', ' Tela Subcutanea ', ' subdermal tissue ', ' Attenuated ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' fetal ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Modeling ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prototype ', ' patient population ', ' elastography ', ' elastic imaging ', ' elasticity imaging ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' imaging system ', ' clinical imaging ', ' neural network ', ' Patient imaging ', ' obese person ', ' obese individuals ', ' obese people ', ' obese population ', ' obese subjects ', ' high body mass index ', ' high BMI ', ' obese patients ', ' patients with obesity ', ' ']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,585234
"Profiling the Functional Genetics of Health and Disease using BrainGENIE: The Brain Gene Expression and Network Imputation Engine Abstract The pathophysiology of brain disorders remains unknown because we cannot study the relevant tissue in living human subjects. Postmortem brain tissue is useful, but expensive, rare, and critically confounded by antemortem and agonal factors. These two facts have inspired the search for alternative strategies, such as the use of surrogate markers like blood-based gene expression. To improve the rigor of this widely used approach, we developed a novel computational method called the Brain Gene Expression and Network Imputation Engine (BrainGENIE) that leverages biological comparability between blood and brain gene expression to predict transcriptome profiles for brain tissue based on blood gene-expression profiles. BrainGENIE is fundamentally different from other transcriptome-imputation methods, and captures a much larger proportion of the variance in—and larger fraction of—the brain transcriptome. BrainGENIE is capable of predicting approximately 9–57% of the brain transcriptome, which yields an approximate 1.8-fold increase in coverage relative to the “gold standard” method PrediXcan, and which greatly improves our statistical power to detect genes and pathways associated with disease. Our proposal contains three Specific Aims to improve our method and shed light on biological pathways underlying neuropsychiatric disorders. Aim 1: Refine BrainGENIE to capture additional genes that are not currently well predicted by our method. Aim 2: Apply BrainGENIE to our collection of publicly available and in-house data to predict brain-region-specific gene expression profiles for over 8,000 living persons, and discover region-specific gene-expression patterns associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Aim 3: Disseminate BrainGENIE as stand-alone software for other researchers to use freely. Guided by recent genetic and genomic studies, we hypothesize that comparable patterns of gene dysregulation will be found across neuropsychiatric disorders among pathways involving innate immunity, chromatin remodeling, neurodevelopment, and neurotransmission. Inclusion of neurodegenerative disorders in our analysis will allow us to determine whether gene expression patterns are shared across a broader range of brain disorders. We also expect to identify disorder-specific and brain-region-specific transcriptomic associations. Our project will enable new lines of inquiry into biological changes that emerge in the brains of living persons, and create opportunities to improve diagnostics, intervention, and treatment. Project Narrative There is a critical need for a method that would allow us to safely study the living human brain so that we can answer centuries-old questions about mental illness, and accelerate progress to improve diagnostics, treatments, and interventions. To accomplish this, we developed a new prediction tool called BrainGENIE that uses correlations between blood and brain tissue to allow us to approximate gene expression levels in the living human brain, and identify molecular mechanisms underlying mental illness. We propose to apply our method to generate brain- region-specific gene expression profiles in over 8,000 individuals (the largest dataset of its kind) and discover genes and biological pathways associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, which will deepen our understanding of pathophysiology.",Profiling the Functional Genetics of Health and Disease using BrainGENIE: The Brain Gene Expression

"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biologicalpathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network

"Non-Invasive Single-Cell Morphometry and Tracking in Living Bacterial Biofilms Project Summary/Abstract  Biofilms are cohesive, multicellular microbial communities that are able to adhere to biotic or abiotic surfaces. The human microbiome contains numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species that help maintain normal human physiology. On the other hand, more than half of the 1.7 million hospital-acquired infections in the US are caused by biofilm-forming bacterial pathogens. The biofilm lifestyle is advantageous, because phenotypic diversity and coordination of cellular behaviors within biofilms provide bacterial populations with emergent capabilities beyond those of individual cells. For example, biofilms are orders of magnitude more tolerant towards physical, chemical, and biological stressors, most notably long-term treatments with antibiotic drugs or clearance attempts by the immune system. However, it remains largely unknown how such remarkable capabilities emerge from the behaviors of individual cells and the interactions between them. A critical barrier to rapid progress is the inability of conventional microscopes to resolve micrometer-sized bacterial cells in thick (>10 micrometers) biofilms in a non-invasive manner. The proposed research addresses this challenge by developing integrated experimental and computational technologies that enable non-invasive, 3D fluorescence imaging of pathogenic biofilms by lattice-light sheet microscopy, accurate single-cell segmentation and 3D shape measurements based on the acquired images, and simultaneous 3D tracking of thousands of cells inside biofilms. The ability to make single- cell measurements in dense microbial populations will enable researchers to correlate the spatial trajectory of each cell with that cells’ gene expression and behavioral phenotype. Such information will provide an integrated understanding of how bacteria coordinate gene expression and social behaviors in 3D space and time. A fundamental understanding of biofilm biology will help inform new strategies for harnessing the emergent functional capabilities of microbial populations and for removing pathogenic biofilms from undesired environments. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance  Bacterial biofilms are responsible for a large number of hospital-acquired infections, and currently used antibiotic and disinfection treatments are unable to cope with this epidemic. An integrated understanding of how individual bacterial cells act and interact with each other inside biofilms is necessary to inform new strategies for controlling biofilm growth. This project enables high-resolution, single-cell measurements inside living biofilms by developing new technologies for non-invasive biofilm imaging and computational tracking of thousands of bacterial cells in crowded environments.",Non-Invasive Single-Cell Morphometry and Tracking in Living Bacterial Biofilms,10247048,R01GM139002,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' bacteria infection ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disinfection ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Industrialization ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Microscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Linear Programming ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' seal ', ' Shigella flexneri ', ' S flexneri ', ' S. flexneri ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Measures ', ' Microbial Biofilms ', ' biofilm ', ' Myxococcus xanthus ', ' M xanthus ', ' M. xanthus ', ' Custom ', ' Cell Shape ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' morphometry ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' institutional infection ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' environmental stresses ', ' environmental stressor ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' microbial ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Property ', ' model design ', ' cell dimension ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' human-associated microbiome ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' Population ', ' microbial community ', ' community microbes ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' public health relevance ', ' Geometry ', ' imaging platform ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' live cell imaging ', ' live cell image ', ' live cellular image ', ' live cellular imaging ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' antibiotic tolerance ', ' tolerance to antibiotics ', ' tolerate antibiotics ', ' bacterial community ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' human pathogen ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Immersion ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,302199
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia The American Cancer Society estimates that 48,330 new cases of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx will be reported this year. When diagnosed at early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83%. However, when diagnosed at intermediate or advance stages, the 5-year survival rate drops to 62% and 38%, respectively. In addition, while early stage treatment may only require minor surgery to remove the localized tumor, later stage treatment could require surgical removal of parts of the face and neck, hence drastically reducing the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, benign oral lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or early invasive cancer even for healthcare professionals. As a result, only 31% of patients are diagnosed at early stages despite the fact that the oral cavity is easily accessible for direct examination. Hence, there is a critical need for new clinical technologies for reliable early diagnosis of oral cancer and dysplasia. Several screening tools for oral cancer have been commercially available, including exfoliative cytology, vital staining, salivary test, and optical interrogation; however, none of them have been demonstrated to be capable of clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that several biomarkers for oral cancer and dysplasia can be accurately quantified by endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) thus enabling levels of sensitivity and specificity adequate for early detection. This bioengineering research grant focuses on developing and validating a cost-effective wide-field multispectral FLIM endoscope for noninvasive in situ detection of oral cancer and dysplasia. To that end we have developed three specific aims. Aim 1: To design and build a cost-effective multispectral FLIM endoscope for in vivo imaging of epithelial tissue in the oral cavity. Aim 2: To develop algorithms for fast and automated FLIM based early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. Aim 3: To quantify prospectively in a pilot clinical study the capability of the proposed FLIM endoscopic tools for noninvasively early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. The successful completion of these aims will result in a novel, accurate and cost-effective clinical tool for noninvasive in situ early detection of cancer and dysplasia. Such a tool could potentially help to improve significantly both the life expectancy and the quality of life for the more than 33,000 oral cancer patients being diagnosed each year at intermediate and advance stages. Beyond early diagnosis, this tool could also assist at every step involved on the clinical management of oral cancer patients, including treatment guidance and monitoring of disease recurrence. Finally, the demonstrated success of this clinical tool in oral epithelial cancer will herald future success with other cancers of epithelial origin, which accounts for more than 80% of all cancers. Early detection of both new and recurrent oral cancer holds great promise for improving both the survival rate and the quality of live of these patients. The proposed work is to develop a clinical tool capable of quantifying noninvasively different biomarkers associated to oral epithelial cancer progression and detecting early stage oral cancer and dysplasia. Such tool will revolutionize oral epithelial cancer management by allowing not only early screening and diagnosis, but also treatment guidance and monitoring for disease recurrence.",Endogenous

"A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images Abstract  The ability of accurate localize and characterize cells in light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) image is indispensable for shedding new light on the understanding of three dimensional structures of the whole brain. In our previous work, we have successfully developed a 2D nuclear segmentation method for the nuclear cleared microscopy images using deep learning techniques. Although the convolutional neural networks show promise in segmenting cells in LSFM images, our previous work is confined in 2D segmentation scenario and suffers from the limited number of annotated data. In this project, we aim to develop a high throughput 3D cell segmentation engine, with the focus on improving the segmentation accuracy and generality. First, we will develop a cloud based semi-automatic annotation platform using the strength of virtual reality (VR) and crowd sourcing. The user-friendly annotation environment and stereoscopic view in VR can significantly improve the efficiency of manual annotation. We design a semi-automatic annotation workflow to largely reduce human intervention, and thus improve both the accuracy and the replicability of annotation across different users. Enlightened by the spirit of citizen science, we will extend the annotation software into a crowd sourcing platform which allows us to obtain a massive number of manual annotations in short time. Second, we will develop a fully 3D cell segmentation engine using 3D convolutional neural networks trained with the 3D annotated samples. Since it is often difficult to acquire isotropic LSFM images, we will further develop a super resolution method to impute a high resolution image to facilitate the 3D cell segmentation. Third, we will develop a transfer learning framework to make our 3D cell segmentation engine general enough to the application of novel LSFM data which might have significant gap of image appearance due to different imaging setup or clearing/staining protocol. This general framework will allow us to rapidly develop a specific cell segmentation solution for new LSFM data with very few or even no manual annotations, by transferring the existing 3D segmentation engine that has been trained with a sufficient number of annotated samples. Fourth, we will apply our computational tools to several pilot neuroscience studies: (1) Investigating how topoisomerase I (one of the autism linked transcriptional regulators) regulates brain structure, and (2) Investigating genetic influence on cell types in the developing human brain by quantifying the number of progenitor cells in fetal cortical tissue. Successful carrying out our project will have wide-reaching impact in neuroscience community in visualizing and analyzing complete cellular resolution maps of individual cell types within healthy and disease brain. The improved cell segmentation engine in 3D allows scientists from all over the world to share and process each other’s data accurately and efficiently, thus increasing reproducibility and power. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a next generation cell segmentation engine for the whole brain tissue cleared images. Our proposed work is built upon our previous 2D nuclear segmentation project using deep learning techniques. However, we found that our current computational tool is limited in 2D segmentation scenario and insufficient of annotated training samples. To address these limitations, we will first develop a cloud-based semi-automatic annotation tool with the capacity of virtual reality. Our annotation tool is designed to be cross- platform, which allows us to partner with “SciStarter” (the largest citizen science projects in the world) and acquire large amount of cell annotations from the science enthusiastic volunteers. Meanwhile, we will develop next generation 3D cell segmentation engine using an end-to-end fully connected convolution neural network. To facilitate 3D cell segmentation, we will also develop a super resolution method to impute an isotropic high- resolution image from a low-resolution microscopy image. After the development of 3D cell segmentation engine, we will continue to improve its generality by developing a transfer learning framework which enables us to rapidly deploy our 3D cell segmentation engine to the novel microscopy images without the time-consuming manual annotation step.

"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,10242915,U01HL142518,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aorta ', ' Aortic Rupture ', ' Arteries ', ' ascending aorta ', ' Attention ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Carotid Arteries ', ' Charge ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Dilatation - action ', ' Dilatation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Foundations ', ' Glycosaminoglycans ', ' Mucopolysaccharides ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Platelet aggregation ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Thrombus ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' mucoid ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Tunica Adventitia ', ' Adventitia ', ' disability ', ' normotensive ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Video Microscopy ', ' Videomicrography ', ' Videomicroscopy ', ' Collaborations ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Event ', ' intracranial artery ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' particle ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' blunt force trauma ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Scheme ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Thoracic aorta ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' healing ', ' virtual ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Rupture ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' Heritability ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' Geometry ', ' microSPECT ', ' micro SPECT ', ' micro single photon emission computed tomography ', ' µSPECT ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' in silico ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,559400
"Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Summary: Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Current investigation of mechanisms underlying many diseases relies on the acquisition of multi-dimensional genomics data. The utility of these data is, however, offset by the lag in development of tools and models to fully interrogate them. In the context of infectious diseases, such data contains molecular information including gene transcription, regulation, and variations from both the infecting pathogen and the host cell, providing a snapshot of the host and pathogen interactions (HPIs). These HPIs determine infection outcomes. For instance, when a pathogen evades, or evolves resistance to defensive host immunity via a multifaceted HPI, it can result in persisting infection, chronic inflammation, malignant transformation, and/or elevated mortality. Recent successes in overcoming immune-evasion of infected tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the clinical gains that can be made by identifying and specifically targeting essential mechanisms of HPIs. Hence, precisely identifying new mode(s) of HPIs is critical for development of effective and personalized interventions. The molecular mechanisms of HPIs underpinning disease can be identified from genomics data. For example, information on whether a transcription factor (TF) regulates genes from either host or pathogen, or both, can be captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of infected host cells. This means that integrative analysis of genome-scale data can provide a platform for large-scale and unbiased detection of often multi- dimensional and novel facets of HPIs in host cells. However, there is a lack of data mining tools and models to extract such information. More importantly, the available analysis tools typically focus on data from either the host or the pathogen and not on the interactions occurring between the two, excluding us from investigating the full HPI spectrum. Thus, novel methods to determine HPIs by simultaneously modeling both host and pathogen data are critical for understanding key cellular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies. My lab specializes in developing computational models to construct HPI maps and to experimentally validate them. As proof-of-principle, we produced a comprehensive HPI map from sequencing samples from large numbers of tumors caused by Epstein–Barr virus. This map delivered unprecedented insights, identifying novel viral integrations, mutations linked to viral reactivation and providing molecular classification of tumors expected to yield individualized cancer therapy. Therefore, my lab is uniquely positioned to uncover mechanistic insights from HPIs. Our program seeks to develop new models and machine learning tools to construct HPI maps in several diseases by focusing on the following major questions: 1) how do expression, integration, and mutational landscapes of host and pathogen affect pathogenesis of disease?; 2) what is the nature of physical HPIs and cross-regulation by major host and pathogen factors that modulate gene expression, such as TFs and RNA binding proteins?; 3) how do HPIs define molecular subtypes to guide personalized treatments? We expect to identify novel HPIs and provide systems-level understanding of mechanisms critical to cell biology. Narrative Understanding how host cells and pathogens interact is key to developing new and individualized therapeutics. Here, we will develop novel computational tools and models to analyze existing and newly generated high throughput data and construct multi-dimensional host pathogen interaction maps. These maps will provide detailed mechanisms underpinning multi-faceted interactions occurring between host and pathogen and will delineate molecular subtypes that can be utilized for novel and personalized treatment options.",Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics,10241946,R35GM138283,"['Affect ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' EB virus ', ' EBV ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' HHV-4 ', ' HHV4 ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Immunity ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Virus Integration ', ' viral integration ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting Initiative ', ' Molecular Profiling Initiative ', ' Molecular Classification of Tumors ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' tool development ', ' tumor ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' genome analysis ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' Immune Evasion ', ' Immune checkpoint inhibitor ', ' Checkpoint inhibitor ', ' immune check point inhibitor ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' ']",NIGMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,381824
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,10254284,R01EB028337,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Calibration ', ' Crystallization ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Gamma Rays ', ' Gamma Radiation ', ' γ-Radiation ', ' γ-Ray ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Portugal ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Production ', ' Neurotransmitter Receptor ', ' Neurohumor Receptors ', ' Neuromediator Receptors ', ' Neuroregulator Receptors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' Staging ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' millimeter ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' photomultiplier ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' brain size ', ' response ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' prototype ', ' Geometry ', ' human imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Rod ', ' ']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2021,237471
"Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis, nanosensing, and deep-learning Project Summary Overview of research: The Reuel Group at Iowa State University (founded Fall 2016) seeks to develop new materials, methods, and measurement devices for biomanufacturing, biotherapeutics, and biosensors. We have active work-streams in 1) optical nanosensors for protein binding, enzymatic activity, and cell membrane disruption, 2) scalable and reliable cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) methods for protein prototyping (extract and genetic template improvements), 3) microfluidics for droplet generation and measurement of CFPS products, interrogated by nanosensors, 4) algorithms for `big data' generated from nanosensors (machine learning and deep learning methods), 5) engineered endospores for time-delayed synthetic biology circuits, and 6) resonant radio frequency sensors for biomanufacturing, wound healing, and water quality. The overall vision of the research program is to simplify and improve the design and manufacturing of biological products (cells and proteins) for applications in therapies, advanced materials, and bio-electronics. Protein based therapies have demonstrated in clinic to be a potent tool in the treatment of many diseases. In recent years, the design, build, and test cycle to find therapies for new disease targets has improved dramatically using techniques such as surface display coupled to evolutionary selection. However, these mutagenic approaches have a few limitations, namely: 1) they require a suitable, naturally occurring sequence as a starting point, 2) they frequently optimize solely on a single desired feature, and 3) they operate as a `black box', meaning that generalizable design rules for in silico prediction of future products is not possible. It is the purpose of this MIRA for ESI research plan to design a closed-loop system that allows for unsupervised design and discovery of protein therapeutics that overcomes these limitations. Over the next five years we will build and integrate the system components which include enzymatic DNA synthesis coupled to cell free protein synthesis to rapidly prototype libraries of custom proteins in micro-droplet reactors. These proteins will then be characterized in the micro-droplets using optical nanosensors, to test for desired features such as stability, binding affinity, selectivity, hydrolytic activity, and/or membrane penetration. This will produce a large labeled data set (tying sequence to phenotypic properties) that can be used to train a deep learning neural network to self-determine sequence patterns for specific properties. Once the tuning coefficients of the network are found, the algorithm will then predict next best sequences which will be synthesized, tested, etc. such that the design loop progresses unsupervised until optimization criteria are met. This new approach will result in faster development of protein therapies that are optimized based on multiple criteria and not tied to existing, natural sequences. For patients this translates to more efficacious therapies with less side effects and a potential for reduced cost (due to shortened design timeline). At the end of the five-year project we will seek to translate this technology, via NIH SBIR funding, such that the new technology can make an impact on actual therapies. Project Narrative This project seeks to develop advanced tools to enable faster discovery and design of protein-based drugs for new disease targets. These tools would enable optimization of multiple parameters simultaneously, creating more potent therapies with less side effects. Thanks to speeding up the development cycle and reducing the time to market, these tools also have the potential to reduce end cost to patients.","Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis, nanosensing, and deep-learning",10252011,R35GM138265,"['Algorithms ', ' Biological Products ', ' Biologic Products ', ' Biological Agent ', ' biopharmaceutical ', ' biotherapeutic agent ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Engineering ', ' Future ', ' In Vitro ', ' Iowa ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Genetic Template ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' TimeLine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Penetration ', ' Training ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Synthesis ', ' protein synthesis ', ' Protein Biosynthesis ', ' water quality ', ' DNA Replication ', ' DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA biosynthesis ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Speed ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' Property ', ' native protein drug ', ' pharmaceutical protein ', ' protein drug agent ', ' therapeutic protein ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' Affinity ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' nanosensors ', ' nano sensing ', ' nano sensors ', ' nanosensing ', ' Coupled ', ' Biomanufacturing ', ' synthetic biology ', ' prototype ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' treatment optimization ', ' therapy optimization ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' side effect ', ' in silico ', ' efficacious treatment ', ' efficacious therapy ', ' ']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,363953
"Machine learning for analysis of walking patterns and physical activity in knee osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) exhibit altered walking patterns that cause repetitive, abnormal forces on the knee joint, leading to disease progression. Existing interventions to reduce knee loading during walking have not resulted in meaningful change in knee OA symptoms or joint structure. A key limitation of existing research has been the use of simplified metrics to describe walking patterns and not accounting for walking amount and intensity (i.e. physical activity). The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize walking patterns and activity in people with and without knee OA and to assess the associations of walking with 2-year change in knee OA outcomes. Machine learning approaches will be used to analyze ground reaction force (GRF) data and accelerometer-derived physical activity metrics in an existing, large, well- characterized cohort (n=2575) from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Machine learning approaches that use selected features and those that are agnostic and utilize all available information from time-varying GRFs will be used in combination with physical activity metrics to classify symptomatic and structural change. The results from machine learning approaches will be compared to those of common statistical approaches. This research will allow for characterization of the complex relationships between walking patterns and activity, providing novel insights into OA disease processes. Further, this research will provide valuable training in applying machine learning approaches to biomechanics data and may inform patient-specific strategies to optimize walking patterns and physical activity for personalized knee OA management.  The principal investigator will leverage prior training in biomedical engineering applied to OA research to further advance her skills in traditional and agnostic machine learning approaches for analyses of biomechanics and physical activity data. The sponsor and co-sponsor at Boston University (BU) will provide mentorship in clinical aspects of OA, implementation of the proposed studies in a large cohort, grantsmanship, and career development. The team will work with a collaborator in computational biomedicine at BU with expertise in machine learning to achieve the scientific and training goals of this project. In addition to hands-on training, the principal investigator will enroll in didactic coursework and workshops at BU related to machine learning and computer programming. Other key aspects of training include participation in research and networking opportunities at BU and other local Institutions, as well as national and international meetings. The sponsors and the Institution provide an environment where the PI will work and learn as a part of a diverse and interdisciplinary team of OA researchers across rehabilitation, rheumatology, epidemiology, computational methods, and imaging specialties. This postdoctoral training environment will prepare the principal investigator for a career as an independent researcher with expertise in machine learning approaches as applied to biomechanics for the study of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis. Narrative This research will use machine learning to understand how walking patterns and physical activity in people with knee osteoarthritis are related to pain and disease worsening.

In such an instance, even with a known genotype a patient's phenotype has to be compared to that of all MCs caused by variants in a gene to determine which MC, if any, is the likely diagnosis or whether patient instead has a novel condition. This comparison is increasingly difficult because delineation of the ~5,100 MCs currently known has typically been based on subjective grouping of affected individuals by phenotypic similarity. We propose to develop a quantitative framework for assessing overlap among the distributions of phenotypes due to pathogenic genotypes the same gene and apply this framework genome-wide. NGS has enabled identification of causal genotypes in hundreds of thousands of individuals with MCs, providing a sufficiently large dataset that it is now feasible to use machine learning to quantitatively and systematically identify “clusters” of co-occurring genotypes and phenotypic features for each known gene. We will refine and validate our approach by comparing differences between conventionally-delineated and quantitatively-delineated MCs and by assessing the similarity of individuals with well-studied atypical phenotypes/genotypes to quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will then apply the optimal strategy across the genome to generate a “next- generation morbid map” based on quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will also apply machine learning approaches to identify genomic properties associated with the propensity for each gene to underlie multiple MCs (i.e., the numeric contribution of each gene to the morbid map or phenotropy). This will enable a more precise and complete understanding of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of each MC, enable more objective diagnosis of individuals with atypical phenotypes, and more robustly identify the existence of multiple MCs among individuals with non-specific “class” phenotypes (e.g., developmental delay, autism, hearing impairment). We will make all newly developed methods publicly available via interactive and programmatic web-based tools to facilitate extension of this work to other human and model organism datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of this project are to develop a quantitative framework that enables objective delineation of Mendelian conditions, apply the framework to systematically delineate conditions across all genes known to underlie a Mendelian condition, and predict the number of conditions due to each gene. This framework will provide a fuller, unbiased characterization of the genotypic/phenotypic spectrum for all Mendelian conditions, enable more precise diagnoses and counseling of individuals with difficult to diagnose phenotypes, and accelerate the detection of new Mendelian conditions.",A next-generation morbid map of the human genome,10251153,R35HG011297,"['Affect ', ' Counseling ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Work ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' hearing defect ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Detection ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' next generation ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' molecular diagnostics ', ' web-based tool ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2021,454043
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,10259833,K01DK110136,"['Abdomen ', '

"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed understanding of admixture is essential for effective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on phenotype are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simplified models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This proposal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to leverage this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate powerful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as effectively as homogeneous populations. The first step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statistical framework to infer fine-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop effective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major impact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to efficiently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human phenotypes, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on fine-scale genomic structure and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can benefit from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,10239056,R35GM125055,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Evolution ', ' Genome ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' structural genomics ', ' Population Group ', ' genetic evolution ', ' Admixture ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' reference genome ', ' reference assembly ', ' genetic architecture ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2021,332952
"CGMP Compliant Closed Cell Culture System for Reproducible De-differentiation of human somatic cells into iPSCs CGMP Compliant Closed Cell Culture System for Reproducible De-differentiation of human somatic cells into iPSCs Abstract The advancement of iPSC-based personalized cell therapies is currently hindered by the challenges in the biomanufacturing of therapeutic cells. Despite approaches that have made the derivation, growth and differentiation of iPSCs more efficient, there remains significant variability in reprogramming efficacy, genomic integrity and developmental potential of iPSCs derived from patient tissue samples. These variabilities include lot-dependent or technician-dependent differentiation efficiency, bacterial or fungal contamination risks, CO2 or O2 concentration level stresses during cell maintenance, high costs or cross- contamination risks with centralized biomanufacturing facility and requirement of cGMP criteria or regulatory compliance. The difference of iPSCs derived from the same sample in their in-vitro growth characteristics and their inability to re-differentiate into the desired tissue type will cause serious problems in therapy. The further advance of iPSC-based personalized medicine is currently limited by the difficulty to generate iPSCs for large populations and at an affordable cost. Therefore Biopico Systems Inc will solve such challenges by developing an automated cGMP Compliant Closed Cell Culture System for reproducible de-differentiation of human somatic cells into iPSCs. To commercialize Biopico's “CellsMX” system, optimization of closed media exchange system and integration of customized mRNA/ media formulation front-end for reprogramming will be performed in this Phase II research. The CellsMX system will provide quality assurance to the customers for mass production under cGMP guidelines, as operating license are issued to biological entities along with how cells are produced, tested, and released for therapeutic use. Further, even, if a large number of patients need iPSC-based personalized cell therapies, under CellsMX closed system, patient cells are not cross-contaminated and the system can be deployed at the point of care avoiding high costs and risks associated with the transportation, logistics, tracking, and recording. While patient-specific iPSC strategy's reduction of immunologic stimulus will drive the initial market segment for the CellsMX system, Biopico will develop a suite of products for several of such therapeutic culture processes. Narrative The stem cells can address diseases such as cancer or damaged or dysfunctional organs using tissues or cell therapies. The enormous transplant waiting lists results in many people die awaiting transplants. Further, to provide stem cells as a viable source of replacement cells to treat diseases, the manufacturing costs are presently not affordable keeping public expectations unrealistic. Biopico's CellsMX reprogramming platform can address these issues to generate large number of iPSC and supply cells for stem cell banking or stem cell therapy applications.",CGMP Compliant Closed Cell Culture System for Reproducible De-differentiation of human somatic cells into iPSCs,10239244,R44GM139413,"['Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Antibodies ', ' Automation ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carbon Dioxide ', ' CO2 ', ' Carbonic Anhydride ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Freezing ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Cyclic GMP ', ' Guanosine Cyclic Monophosphate ', ' cGMP ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Manuals ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stress ', ' Syringes ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Therapy ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transfection ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Transportation ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Film ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' quality assurance ', ' Microscope ', ' Pump ', ' Vial device ', ' Vial ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Stimulus ', ' wasting ', ' Individual ', ' Licensing ', ' Logistics ', ' Systems Integration ', ' cell mediated therapies ', ' cell-based therapeutic ', ' cell-based therapy ', ' cellular therapy ', ' Cell Therapy ', ' Therapeutic ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' meter ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' Sampling ', ' flasks ', ' stem cell based therapy ', ' stem cell mediated therapy ', ' stem cell therapeutics ', ' stem cell treatment ', ' stem cell-based treatment ', ' stem cell therapy ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' Differentiation and Growth ', ' Motor ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cell Culture System ', ' Cell Maintenance ', ' Cell Growth and Maintenance ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Monitor ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' cell morphology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Biomanufacturing ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' operation ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' genome integrity ', ' genomic integrity ', ' Formulation ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' pressure sensor ', ' ']",NIGMS,BIOPICO,R44,2021,577188

"Resolving Spatiotemporal Determinants of Cell Specification in Corticogenesis with Latent Space Methods Project Summary High-throughput profiling of hundreds of thousands of cells in the central nervous system (CNS) is currently underway. One of the goals of the BRAIN initiative is to build a census of cell types in the CNS, however previous work in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has demonstrated that reliance on small collections of marker genes for cell type/state/position classification is insufficient to account for the dynamic nature of and variation in cellular classes/states. Previous work from both myself and others has demonstrated that latent space methods identify low dimensional patterns from high dimensional profiling data can discover molecular drivers of cell types and states in scRNAseq. However, the use of algorithms untethered to biological constraints or not extensively functionally validated can lead to the arbitrary delineation of cell class/state and the trivial designation of “novel” cell types. As proper development of the CNS requires precise regulation and coordination of spatial and temporal cues, the overall objective of this application is to develop analytic and experimental methods that integrate spatiotemporal information with scRNAseq to learn meaningful latent spaces. Specifically, I will 1) generate a comprehensive collection of transcriptional signatures for spatial features of the brain, 2) build dimension reduction software to encode spatial and cell cycle information to account for the highly specific organization of cells in the CNS, 3) derive a statistic, projectionDrivers, that allows for quantification of the gene drivers of differential latent space usage, and 4) define a statistic, proMapR, that will tell you the probability of a cell existing in a particular location in the brain at a given point in time from the cell's transcriptional signature. The ability to define and validate biologically meaningful latent spaces not only enables multiOmic data integration and exploratory analysis of scRNA-seq data via the massive amount of publicly available data, but also lays the groundwork for multimodal data integration—a necessary next step to characterize how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. Resolving Spatiotemporal Determinants of Cell Specification in Corticogenesis with Latent Space Methods Applicant: Genevieve Stein-O’Brien, PhD MHS Proper development of the brain requires precise regulation and coordination of spatiotemporal cues. We hypothesize human genetic variation manifests phenotypic differences by introducing small biases in spatiotemporal determinants that have accumulated effect over development.

"Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a national and global public health emergency. Because the causative virus is novel, the present options for treatment are extremely limited, and an effective vaccine could be 1-2 years away. Thus, there is an urgent need for efficacious therapeutics against the disease. While development of new drugs is under way, that process is slow and resource-intensive. In the short- to-medium term, a superior strategy is to repurpose already existing drugs to treat the disease. Over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical effect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or the hyperinflammatory immune response it provokes. What is unclear is how many of these have a significant, protective effect on actual patients, as only a tiny fraction of these drugs is in clinical trials. Most of these agents are chronic medications, and thus there are millions of Americans who are already using them. The first aim of this study is to assess the degree of protection any of these drugs confers against the serious complications of COVID-19 while adjusting for known risk factors and confounders. The second aim is to search for additional interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and specific demographic and/or clinical subgroups that could be protective or harmful. The Change Healthcare Database, a part of the COVID-19 Research Database, contains up-to-date health insurance claims data for about one- third of all Americans. Using this database, this study will evaluate the impact of these drugs on the risk of four important outcomes in patients who are COVID-19-positive: need for hospitalization, use of mechanical ventilation, shock, and death. Results will be risk-adjusted for the risk factors already well established to predict poor outcomes in COVID-19. This study will further mine the data for second- and third-order interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and different subpopulations of patients using a novel machine learning method called the Feasible Solution Algorithm (FSA). The FSA enables the researcher to uncover higher-order statistical interactions in regression models, which leads to the identification of subgroups and complexities that are not always apparent with traditional regression models. If the results show candidate drugs with highly protective effects, these can be prioritized for prospective clinical studies. Drugs that show harmful effects can be considered for discontinuation in infected or high-risk patients. Project Narrative Repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is a much faster and more resource-effective approach than developing new drugs de novo. This holds promise because over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical activity against SARS- CoV-2 or the immune response it provokes. Using a large health insurance claims database, we will assess the potentially protective effects of each of these drugs on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and search for interactions between multiple drugs and specific demographic and clinical subpopulations via a novel statistical algorithm.","Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus

"Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) Methods for Studying Protein Stability Abstract. There is great interest in technologies that measure protein stability, because many devastating diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer’s disease) are linked to protein misfolding and instability. One especially promising way to treat these diseases is to use small molecules, termed “correctors” that bind to the damaged protein and partially restore its folding. Multiple correctors have received FDA approval (e.g. ivacaftor, tafamadis, migalastat), but there are hundreds of additional misfolding diseases. What are the hurdles to the rapid discovery of additional correctors? One important barrier is that previous correctors have been uncovered through prolonged searches, using specialized (i.e. target-specific) technologies that are not versatile enough for use across many proteins-of-interest (POIs). Here, we propose next-generation Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) to fill this gap. In a typical DSF experiment, a POI is heated in a qPCR instrument and its un-folding is monitored by its binding to a solvatochromatic dye (e.g. Sypro Orange, SO). The resulting temperature vs. fluorescence curves are then used to estimate the melting transition (Tm), with putative correctors identified by their effect on this value (DTm). DSF is versatile because it does not require protein labeling or structural knowledge. Moreover, unlike comparable platforms, such as circular dichroism (CD) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), DSF is amenable to 384-well plate format, facilitating large-scale chemical screens. While DSF has the potential to transform corrector discovery, there are major hurdles to overcome. For example, DSF often fails because SO does not bind the target protein or it binds to hydrophobic patches on the native state, obscuring the Tm. Further, for some POIs, the temperature-fluorescence curves are complex, with multiple transitions, and therefore not readily analyzed or fit using standard equations. Based on our preliminary screens of ~50 different proteins, these issues cause DSF to fail in more than 60% of cases. We propose to solve these issues through disruptive innovations: (SA1) Design and synthesis of next-generation dye libraries that significantly expand the scope of DSF and (SA2) Theory- and experiment-driven, dramatic improvements in data analysis, enabled by machine learning and made publicly available through a web portal (DSFWorld). Encouraged by preliminary success, we also propose to: (SA3) Expand the scope of DSF applications by pioneering studies of multi-protein complexes and conformational changes. Importantly, we will benchmark each of these innovations against current state-of-the-art approaches, with a focus on a critical understanding of strengths and weaknesses. Together, these studies are expected to dramatically expand the scope of DSF technology. PROJECT NARRATIVE. Protein instability is the cause of many devastating and untreatable human diseases.

"Neuromodulation of maternal immune adaptations in pregnancy PROJECT SUMMARY Pregnancy relies on finely-tuned adaptations of the maternal immune system to establish and maintain immune-tolerance to the semi-allogeneic fetus, which appear to be imbalanced in women experiencing complications, such as preterm birth. Outside the pregnancy context, the central nervous system can modulate systemic immunity via the sympathetic nervous system, while its role in modulating maternal immune system adaptations during pregnancy remains unknown. Understanding the determinants of immune regulation throughout pregnancy is a prerequisite to advance the early risk assessment and treatment of pathological pregnancies. This research project proposes to target the interaction between the brain, pregnancy, and the immune system. State-of-the-art immunology (mass cytometry) and neuroscience (neuromodulation of discrete neuronal circuitry) approaches will be combined to comprehensively investigate neuroimmune regulation of human term and preterm pregnancies and mouse models of pregnancy. Specifically, we hypothesize that a hyperactive sympathetic (adrenergic) tone enhances systemic pro-inflammatory monocyte responses, thereby contributing to a compromised fetal tolerance in preterm pregnancies. The first aim of this proposal will monitor the responsiveness innate pro-inflammatory monocytes to adrenergic signals (using single-cell high-dimensional mass cytometry), and the nervous-system associated proteome (e.g., adrenergic analytes, Brice Gaudilliere lab) throughout the human third trimester. This aim is based on my current expertise in human pregnancy immunology and multi-parameter approaches, and a continuation of my prior in-depth analyses of the pre-labor plasma signature and immunome in the last 100 days of healthy pregnancy, which accurately predict the onset of labor. In aim 2, to understand brain-pregnancy communication on a mechanistic level, neuroscience approaches (fiber photometry and chemogenetics) will be used under supervision of the Luis de Lecea lab, who pioneered cutting-edge neuro-modulatory techniques. Here, I will manipulate discrete neural populations, known to either suppress or enhance peripheral immunity, throughout late gestation in mouse pregnancies with the aim to monitor their link to peripheral monocyte responsiveness. Reciprocally, fiber photometry will track pregnancy- specific alterations in activity of these neural populations. In the third and final aim 3, I will determine whether monocyte responses to sympathetic signals differ throughout preterm vs. term pregnancies by analyzing maternal blood collected in each trimester of pregnancy, using high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to train a model for preterm vs. term sample classification. In the independent R00 phase, I envision to apply techniques from immunology and neuroscience to understand pregnancy biology and pathology from a central nervous system perspective. Together, the set of proposed studies will answer fundamental questions in the nascent field of brain- peripheral immunity cross-talk, and elucidate understudied mechanism of neuroimmunomodulation in pregnancy, while significantly aiding in my career development and academic transition to independence.

"Heritability and cognitive implications of structural-functional connectome coupling The human brain is an unimaginably complicated system of interconnected neurons that is capable of complex thought, emotion and behavior. Macroscale white matter connections quantified via the structural connectome (SC) act as the backbone for the flow of functional activation, which can be represented via the functional con- nectome (FC). Our group and others have shown that quantifying properties of the brain’s structural and func- tional connectomes and their relationship can inform understanding of brain-behavior associations and disease mechanisms4-9. However, models that describe SC-FC relationships have only achieved moderate agreement with observations and have not been used to fully explore the heritability and cognitive implications of structure- function coupling in adult and developing populations. If we do not accurately understand how the brain’s anat- omy and physiology are linked across the human lifespan, then we will not be able to quantify the impact of disease or pathological developmental trajectories. Our long-term goal is to create computational tools for stud- ying the brain’s structure and function, particularly in the context of disease. The overarching objective of this project is to create a model that accurately {and interpretably} quantifies the coupling between the structural and functional connectomes in both sexes, which will in turn allow us to investigate the heritability and cognitive implications of SC-FC coupling across developing and adult populations. Our central hypothesis is that a {hybrid approach to predicting FC from SC, combining both biophysical modeling and deep learning,} will be more ac- curate than existing techniques. Based on the prior literature and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that SC- FC coupling will vary with sex, be heritable, associated with development, and explain inter-subject variability in cognition. Our hypothesis is supported by preliminary data from our group and others that show SC-FC relation- ships are heritable and vary with sex and cognition in patients7,18. The rationale for this work is that having an accurate model of the SC-FC relationship in healthy populations, which currently does not exist, will further our understanding of the complex relationship between anatomy, physiology, sex, genetics and cognition. We will test the central hypothesis via three specific aims: 1) identify the most accurate model for predicting FC from SC, 2) quantify the heritability of SC-FC coupling and its association with cognitive performance and 3) characterize the SC-FC coupling trajectory and its cognitive implications throughout development. We will use neuroimaging, genetic and cognitive data from the Human Connectome Project, including young adult (~1000 individuals, 22- 37 years) and developing populations (~650 individuals, 5-21 years). The approach is innovative, as it proposes to use model-driven, data-driven and hybrid approaches to model SC-FC relationships and that it poses to ex- plore sex effects, heritability, cognitive and developmental implications of SC-FC relationships. The proposed research is significant in that understanding structure-function relationships across typical development will allow quantification of the impact of disease and reveal avenues for novel treatments in various neurological diseases. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the relationship between brain anatomy, physiology, genetics and cognition throughout human development is paramount to understanding of how it can break down in disease. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NICHD's mission in that it seeks to understand human development and optimize abilities for all.",Heritability and cognitive implications of structural-functional connectome coupling,10189014,RF1MH123232,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' Hybrids ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Maps ', ' Mission ', ' Structural Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Ships ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Dissociation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Genetic ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Heritability ', ' brain behavior ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' biophysical model ', ' cognitive performance ', ' connectome ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,RF1,2021,1292521
"Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield, UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics]). NARRATIVE This proposed research is aimed at classifying novel subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by studying inflammation in the blood of patients (complex protein and genetic profiles) and using sophisticated computational methods (machine learning and systems-based network analysis) to find data patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. This research is relevant to public health as the burden of morbidity and mortality is high in PAH, and the current system used to classify patients does not inform treatment decisions. Our project has significant potential to improve public health, as it may yield a PAH classification scheme that sits closer to underlying pathobiology, provide a critical step toward identifying patients who will respond to specific therapies, help improve the design of forthcoming clinical trials, and create a framework for precision medicine.",Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning,10192823,K23HL151892,"['Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Critical Care ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Immunity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxin ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' chemokine ', ' Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Homologous Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Intercrines ', ' SIS cytokines ', ' chemoattractant cytokine ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Systemic disease ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' protein complex ', ' Address ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Immune Targeting ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mononuclear ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Transcript ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Immunomodulators ', ' IMiD ', ' Immune modulatory therapeutic ', ' immune modulating agents ', ' immune modulating drug ', ' immune modulating therapeutics ', ' immune modulators ', ' immune modulatory agents ', ' immune modulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulating agents ', ' immunomodulatory agents ', ' immunomodulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulatory therapeutics ', ' pulmonary arterial hypertension ', ' pulmonary artery hypertension ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' transcriptomics ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Network-based ', ' therapeutic target ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' differential expression ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Growth Agents ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' clinical subtypes ', ' public repository ', ' publicly accessible repository ', ' publicly available repository ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536
"Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD ABSTRACT End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies, with 25% dying within 1 year and 41% surviving at least 5 years. While providers recognize that patients are different – and ought to be differently – there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy and aid in treatment individualization. Instead, providers are left with often unclear or incomplete guidelines on how best to manage patients. In order to provide precision care for patients on hemodialysis (HD), there is a critical need to be able to (1) dynamically assess life expectancy for medical decision-making; and (2) identify distinct clinical phenotypes to enhance clinical monitoring and care planning. Our central hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in patient survivorship and disease trajectory that, when known, can be used to provide more personalized and effective care. By coupling novel machine learning approaches for survival prediction with granular clinical data on HD patients, we will be able to develop the analytic tools necessary to support precision care. At the completion of this proposal we will have tools to dynamically assess a patient's life expectancy and insights into heterogeneous disease phenotypes for patients with ESKD. These tools will allow providers to make informed treatment decisions as well as lay the groundwork for further precision research into optimized patient care. NARRATIVE End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies. However, there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy.

"OpenMM: Scalable biomolecular modeling, simulation, and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT OpenMM [http://openmm.org] is the most widely-used open source GPU-accelerated framework for biomolecular modeling and simulation (>1300 citations, >270,000 downloads, >1M deployed instances). Its Python API makes it widely popular as both an application (for modelers) and a library (for developers), while its C/C++/Fortran bindings enable major legacy simulation packages to use OpenMM to provide high performance on modern hardware. OpenMM has been used for probing biological questions that leverage the $14B global investment in structural data from the PDB at multiple scales, from detailed studies of single disease proteins to superfamily-wide modeling studies and large-scale drug development efforts in industry and academia. Originally developed with NIH funding by the Pande lab at Stanford, we aim to fully transition toward a community governance and sustainable development model and extend its capabilities to ensure OpenMM can power the next decade of biomolecular research. To fully exploit the revolution in QM-level accuracy with machine-learning (ML) potentials, we will add plug-in support for ML models augmented by GPU-accelerated kernels, enabling transformative science with QM-level accuracy. To enable high-productivity development of new ML models with training dataset sizes approaching 100 million molecules, we will develop a Python framework to enable OpenMM to be easily used within modern ML frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Together with continued optimizations to exploit inexpensive GPUs, these advances will power a transformation within biomolecular modeling and simulation, much as deep learning has transformed computer vision. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomolecular modeling and simulation is a key technology for leveraging the $14B global investment in biomolec- ular structure data in the protein databank to understand the basic molecular mechanisms underlying biology and disease and the development of new therapies. In this proposal, we aim to expand the development of OpenMM, a free and open source biomolecular modeling and simulation package that can exploit a wide range of consumer-grade and high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) to enable researchers and applications built on OpenMM to achieve high performance with extreme ﬂexibility. A key aspect of this proposal is to accelerate research in the emerging ﬁeld of biomolecular machine learning by tightly integrating OpenMM with modern ma- chine learning frameworks, enabling researchers to build, use, and deploy machine learning potentials, collective variables, and integrators to advance the state of biomolecular modeling.","OpenMM: Scalable biomolecular modeling, simulation, and machine learning",10100573,R01GM140090,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Biology ', ' Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Industry ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Chemical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Productivity ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Biological ', ' Pythons ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Sustainable Development ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' enzyme mechanism ', ' Performance ', ' physical model ', ' Speed ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' drug development ', ' molecular mechanics ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' model development ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' cluster computing ', ' data grid ', ' datagrid ', ' distributed computing ', ' next generation ', ' quantum ', ' interoperability ', ' Plug-in ', ' open source ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' operation ', ' small molecule therapeutics ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' software infrastructure ', ' protein data bank ', ' protein databank ', ' Home ', ' ']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,426294
"Pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cholangitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this proposal is to conduct the first multi-omics translational study of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), thereby identifying the systems-level networks driving pathological processes in this rare, autoimmune liver disease. Improved understanding of PBC pathogenesis is urgently needed to inform tailored care and the development of new effective therapies. Comprehensive assessments of immunity and the role of environmental influence in PBC are currently lacking. Such evaluations would provide critical knowledge to leverage recent advances in the field’s ability to pharmacologically alter the immune system, thereby providing new hope to PBC patients. Having made significant contributions to the understanding of the genomic architecture underlying development of autoimmunity in PBC, we propose a novel, patient-oriented, multi- omics approach. In this new application, we will decipher how peripheral cellular immunity and non-cellular circulating factors contribute to PBC pathogenesis. We hypothesize that multi-omic analyses integrating cellular and non-cellular factors will identify systems-level pathways driving PBC pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we develop an innovative platform that combines aspects of machine learning and quantum statistical mechanics to identify omics-based signatures of PBC that when integrated with clinical features will unveil biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis.  To perform this multi-omic study of PBC, we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team synergizing expertise in PBC biology and omics-scale analytics as well as resources across Mayo Clinic and Columbia University. With a new, in-hand collection of diverse biological specimens from 300 deeply- phenotyped PBC patients and 300 well-matched controls, our studies are already underway with preliminary data demonstrating measureable immunome, methylome, inflammatory protein, exposome, and metabolome differences between PBC patients and controls. In Aim 1, we thoroughly evaluate peripheral immune composition (the immunome) and activation state (methylome, transcriptome, inflammatory proteins) using mass-cytometry (CyTOF), sequencing- and proximity extension-based methods. In Aim 2, we perform a cutting-edge study of exogenous chemicals “the exposome” and endogenous metabolites “the metabolome” using ultrahigh resolution mass spectroscopy to discover pathogenic alterations in metabolism in PBC. We also develop an assay to quantify liver-specific cell-free DNA in blood as a measure of disease severity. In Aim 3, we integrate omic-specific signatures (Aims 1 and 2) using a novel approach to identify and prioritize PBC- associated features for further biological investigation. We then infer clinically-relevant subgroups of PBC patients by performing similarity network fusion analysis. In summary, using state-of-the-art, multi-omic analyses, we will discover systems-level networks driving PBC pathogenesis, spurring development of new hypotheses and studies designed to elucidate PBC pathobiology and identify novel therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will conduct the first multi-omics translational study of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), to improve understanding of the culprits driving this rare, autoimmune liver disease. By integrating multiple layers of omics data, we will better define the architecture of cellular networks driving PBC.

"Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased ~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls. Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months. Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision. R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.  Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials. Narrative  This proposal will perform RNAseq on blood of a derivation cohort of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients to determine those genes that best predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) between 4 and 14 days and that predict median Rankin Scores (mRS) outcomes at 90 days using cross-correlation. These genes are then measured in an independent validation cohort of SAH patients to predict who develops DCI by 14d, and to predict their mRS at 90 days after SAH. The studies will direct early treatment for DCI, identify treatment targets for DCI, and help stratify patients for future DCI treatment trials.",Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10105072,R61NS119345,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aneurysm ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Arteries ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' bloodbrain barrier ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Infarction ', ' cerebral infarct ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nimodipine ', ' Nimotop ', ' Patients ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Pulmonary Edema ', ' lung edema ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Societies ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Catheters ', ' Vasospasm ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrovascular Spasm ', ' Cerebral Artery Spasm ', ' Cerebral Vasospasm ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Myocardial depression ', ' cardiac dysfunction ', ' heart dysfunction ', ' Myocardial dysfunction ', ' Whole Blood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages ', ' Modeling ', ' Cerebral Ischemia ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Endothelin Receptor Antagonist ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Quantitative RTPCR ', ' qRTPCR ', ' Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' treatment trial ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' spreading depression ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' FDA approved ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' cerebral microvasculature ', ' brain microvasculature ', ' brain microvessels ', ' cerebral microvessels ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' care costs ', ' Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ', ' stroke patient ', ' support vector machine ', ' biomarker signature ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R61,2021,681385
"Novel imaging genetic biomarkers for sporadic frontotemporal dementia through machine learning Project Summary This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Iris Broce-Diaz, a neuroimaging genetics postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Diego and University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Broce-Diaz is establishing herself as a young imaging geneticist conducting clinical research on neurodegenerative disease. This K01 will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) gain proficiency in machine learning and computational modeling techniques, (2) gain proficiency in clinical and genetic research methodology for cognitive aging and complex spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including clinical characterization of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias, differential diagnosis, risk prediction, and biomarker development, and (3) develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Broce-Diaz has assembled an expert mentoring team, including her primary mentors: Dr Anders Dale (renowned computational neuroimaging genetics scientist) and co-primary mentor Bruce Miller (internationally recognized behavioral neurologist and leader in FTD), co-mentors: Drs. Jennifer Yokoyama (expert in FTD genetics) and Chun Chieh Fan (expert in epidemiology/biostatistics), and two collaborators: Drs. Adam Boxer (leader in clinical trials for FTD-spectrum disorders) and Wesley Thompson (expert in advanced statistics). The goal of the proposed project is to develop novel imaging genetics biomarkers for predicting individuals at risk of developing sporadic (non-familial) FTD and improving classification accuracy of sporadic FTD. Dr. Broce- Diaz will achieve this goal through the following specific aims: (1a) utilize a polygenic hazard approach to develop and validate a novel genetic biomarker for predicting age-specific risk of sporadic FTD; (1b) leverage pleiotropic information to increase accuracy of the genetic risk scores and derive biologically-based genetic risk scores; (2) use machine learning approaches to reliably and accurately classify FTD clinical subtypes and obtain personalized atrophy scores from these brain maps; and (3) improve FTD classification by integrating atrophy scores with genetic risk scores. This proposed study uses highly innovative methodological approaches for informing FTD prognosis, diagnosis, and, ultimately, clinical trial design. If validated, these biomarkers will make significant contributions by assisting clinicians in identifying patients at elevated risk for sporadic FTD and assisting in diagnosing sporadic FTD in its earliest stages—reducing diagnostic delays, accelerating the discovery of novel treatments, and improving recruitment accuracy in clinical trials. This K01 research project will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the protected research time and opportunity to train with leaders in the field she needs to master the skills required to establish an independent, patient-oriented, imaging genetics and biomarker development clinical research program that will inform diagnosis, prognosis, and guide treatments of FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Narrative The development and validation of predictive models is a critical step toward improving strategies for an early diagnosis of sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other neurodegenerative diseases and improving strategies for personalized treatment. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel imaging genetic biomarkers that can help clinicians with an early and accurate diagnosis and prognosis of sporadic FTD.

"Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at managing the optimal care for individual cases due to difficulties of accurately assessing the potential progression and its speed and magnitude. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large inter-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we propose novel agnostic data-driven deep learning approaches to detect glaucoma and accurately forecast its progression that are optimized to each individual case. We will use state- of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. Instead of relying on the conventional knowledge-based approaches (e.g. quantifying tissues known to be significantly associated with glaucoma such as retinal nerve fiber layer), the proposed cutting-edge agnostic deep learning approaches determine the features responsible for future structural and functional changes out of thousands of features autonomously by learning from the provided large longitudinal dataset. This program will advance the use of structural and functional information obtained in the clinics with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma. Furthermore, the developed methods have potentials to be applied to various clinical applications beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology. Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies using agnostic deep learning approaches that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression forecasting and monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes,10089451,R01EY030929,"['Atlases ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Color ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Retina ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' falls ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Visit ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' treatment planning ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Measurable ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' RNFL ', ' clinical practice ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' case-by-case basis ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' individual patient ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' preservation ', ' personalized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' ocular imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' feature selection ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,376028
"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These studies will create a new powerful technology for accelerated antibiotic development targeting diverse bacteria and give rise to new families of antibiotics.",Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development,10094184,R01AI136799,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Pharmaceutical Chemistry ', ' Medicinal Chemistry ', ' Pharmaceutic Chemistry ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Diffusion ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Infection ', ' Kinetics ', ' Libraries ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Permeability ', ' Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' P aeruginosa ', ' P. aeruginosa ', ' Pseudomonas pyocyanea ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Walkers ', ' Measures ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Multi-Drug Resistance ', ' Multidrug Resistance ', ' Multiple Drug Resistance ', ' Multiple Drug Resistant ', ' Resistance to Multi-drug ', ' Resistance to Multidrug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistant to multi-drug ', ' Resistant to multidrug ', ' multi-drug resistant ', ' multidrug resistant ', ' uptake ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' tool ', ' Antibiotic Treatment ', ' bacterial disease treatment ', ' bacterial infectious disease treatment ', ' Antibiotic Therapy ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' success ', ' cell envelope ', ' trait ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Drug Efflux ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Molecular ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' antibiotic efflux ', ' antibiotic export ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' experimental analysis ', ' efflux pump ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' clinical investigation ', ' multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' MDR P aeruginosa ', ' MDR P. aeruginosa ', ' MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ', ' multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa ', ' human pathogen ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' kinetic model ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2021,1106111
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",10075930,R01DK119860,"['Biopsy ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Laboratories ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' liver biopsy ', ' Liver lesion biopsy ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' liver imaging ', ' liver scanning ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Liver Fibrosis ', ' fibrotic liver ', ' hepatic fibrosis ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' chronic hepatic disease ', ' chronic hepatic disorder ', ' chronic liver disorder ', ' chronic liver disease ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Test Result ', ' Performance ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Therapeutic Clinical Trial ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Phase II/III Trial ', ' Phase 2/3 trial ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' screening ', ' liver injury ', ' Injury to Liver ', ' hepatic damage ', ' hepatic injury ', ' liver damage ', ' elastography ', ' elastic imaging ', ' elasticity imaging ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ', ' NAFLD ', ' non-alcohol fatty liver disease ', ' non-alcoholic liver disease ', ' nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ', ' recruit ', ' hepatocellular injury ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,448421

"Model-based credit assignment Abstract How the brain forms, tunes, and uses predictive models that specify the causal links between stimuli in the environment, our choices, and their outcomes is a fundamental question in Psychology and Neuroscience. A great deal of progress has been made identifying the neural computations theorized to form and update predictive models. This research has played a central role in the rise of computational psychiatry, but its relevance to clinical disorders has been limited in part by the use of relatively simple learning/choice paradigms that capture only a narrow subset of the structural complexity of real-world learning.  In order to make sound predictions in a complex world, the brain needs to attribute good and bad outcomes to their most likely causes, a problem known as “credit assignment”. There is little understanding of how outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in structured real-world environments. Most real-world learning occurs in complex and structured environments, such as hierarchical systems (e.g. seasonal events, social hierarchies, contextual rules, etc.). Recent evidence suggests that humans can use an understanding of the environment’s causal structure to attribute outcomes to their most likely causes (which I call “model-based credit assignment)”, rather than simply attributing them to the most recently experienced stimuli and choices that were made (which I call “model-free” credit assignment), as standard models have proposed.  The purpose of the present proposal is to develop the first neural model of model-based credit assignment. We hypothesize that the brain reinstates the cause when a reinforcement outcome is experienced to associate with the outcome. In other words, so that “fire-together/wire-together” plasticity mechanisms can link a choice with an outcome, the choice representation and the outcome representation must both be active at the same time even though the causal choice or event may have actually occurred some time beforehand.  To test this and other predictions, we will integrate mathematical descriptions of learning and decision making with “representational” analysis methods that allow inferences to be made about the information represented in brain areas, applied to fMRI and scalp EEG data. fMRI will reveal how neural learning signals update neural representations of likely causes during learning, while EEG will reveal the timing of the hypothesized reinstatement. These experiments will set the stage to apply the insights gained to investigate how the brain attributes outcomes to more abstract “latent” causes in hierarchically structured environments prevalent in the real world. The proposed project will thus move this general program of research strategy toward learning tasks that better reflect the complexity and structure in many real-world learning/choice situations important for both typical and atypical individuals. Project Narrative Research into how the brain forms and tunes predictive models that specify the causal relationships between stimuli in the environment, our actions, and their outcomes has made dramatic strides by identifying key learning computations in the brain in both typical and atypical individuals. However, the application of this research to clinical disorders has been limited by use of relatively simple learning/choice tasks that do not capture much of the structural complexity of real-world learning. The present project aims to develop the first neural model specifying how reinforcement outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in such structured environments.",Model-based credit assignment,10083230,R56MH119116,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clams ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Goals ', ' Social Hierarchy ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Shellfish ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Dominance ', ' Dominance Hierarchy ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Scallop ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Allergic Reaction ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' neural model ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Service delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' care delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography ', ' fMRI/EEG ', ' shellfish hypersensitivity ', ' allergic to shellfish ', ' allergy to shellfish ', ' shellfish allergy ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2021,384992
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Coupling and spread of molecular and functional pathology of Alzheimer's disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease resulting in loss of cognitive and bodily function, and no cure or effective treatment currently exists. While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein aggregation, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and metabolic defects, the exact mechanism of neuronal death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. The goal of this research project is to test whether molecular and cellular dysfunction can be transmitted from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To achieve this goal, we will first map the functional connectivity between regions of brain in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, observe how these connections change over the progression of the disease, and link these functional changes to behavioral phenotypes in animals. We will then profile levels of inflammatory cytokines and metabolites in tissue from several brain regions in these same mice, and observe whether changes in immunometabolic state coincide in time and space with the functional connections measured by MRI. Successful completion of this work will test a potential mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease spreading through the brain, and provide a map of coupling between immune, metabolic, and functional pathology that could open new directions for future development of early disease diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE While several pathological processes have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, including protein build-up, inflammation, decreased blood flow, and faulty metabolism, the exact mechanism of brain cell death and how the disease spreads from one region of the brain to another is unknown. We propose that the dysfunctional cellular state leading to brain cell death is transferred from cell to cell along their pathways of communication in the brain. To test this idea, we will map paths of brain activity using neuroimaging in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease, measure the corresponding levels of immune markers and metabolic function in each brain region, and then overlay these maps to understand how they correspond over the course of disease.

"Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use Project Summary Although enormous progress has been made in reducing cigarette smoking in the United States, large disparities remain across subpopulations such as racial minorities. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of disease and early death. However, African Americans (AA) are less likely to quit smoking successfully than are non-Hispanic Whites, and they are also three times more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than Whites. There is a remarkable variation in the incidence of lung cancer due to cigarette smoking among racial/ethnic groups in the United States, and African Americans have significantly greater risks than Whites at lower levels of smoking. Tobacco use landscape is changing among U.S. adults with an estimated 4.5% of adults aged 18 years and older reporting current use of electronic cigarettes (EC). Evidence suggests that e-cigarette aerosol is substantially less toxic than combustible cigarette smoking, but e-cigarette use may also post elevated risk for former smokers to relapse back to combustible cigarette smoking. Biomarker can play an important role in assessing the potential health effects of tobacco products and studies have found that AA have higher levels of serum cotinine per cigarette smoked, higher urinary amount of TNE and NNAL than Whites. However, evidence on the racial disparities of biomarker outcomes of EC use is scarce, especially whether and to what extent they are different from use of various EC devices, flavors, and transitions in EC ↔ cigarettes. The overarching goal of this study is to examine the racial disparities in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants in association with EC use by analyzing the restricted Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Wave 1-4 biomarker data. We will link the biomarker data with the PATH adult surveys to identify the between- person and within-person differences in biomarkers by use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition in EC and combustible cigarettes across different waves (Aim 1). We will further leverage machine learning algorithms to develop a composite bio (biomarker)-socio (socio-demographics) -psycho (psychosocial factors) risk index score for each racial/ethnic group to predict subsequent abstinence from cigarette smoking and relapse to cigarette smoking since these 2 outcomes represent the most meaningful transitions from a public health perspective. This study is innovative in its focus on racial disparities of biomarkers by leveraging the nationally longitudinal data, and on using machine learning algorithms to predict future smoking cessation and relapse behaviors in EC ↔ cigarette transition. Fulfillment of these aims will build a scientific base for maximizing the value of existing biospecimen collections. Findings from this R21 study are expected to inform regulatory strategies to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and set the stage for a future R01 application that will develop personalized intervention strategies that incorporate biomarker measures to reduce racial disparities in tobacco use and improve health outcomes. 1 Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine racial disparities in biomarkers of e-cigarette use by linking the PATH Waves 1-4 restricted biomarker data and adult survey data. The study will extend our knowledge on the heterogeneity in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants across racial and ethnic groups, including use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition between e-cigarettes and cigarettes. We will further develop a bio-socio-psycho risk index score to predict abstinence from cigarette smoking, relapse to cigarette use, and tobacco-related health outcomes using machine learning algorithms across racial and ethnic groups.","Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use",10232728,R21DA054818,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Menthol ', ' Metals ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Nicotine ', ' Play ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' airway symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' Hispanics ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' tobacco product use ', ' Tobacco use ', ' toxicant ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Cigarette ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Collection ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' urinary ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' 18 year old ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnoracial ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' smoking relapse ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' vaping ', ' racial disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health ', ' electronic cigarette user ', ' e-cig user ', ' e-cigarette user ', ' ecig user ', ' ecigarette user ', ' cigarette user ', ' combustible cigarette ', ' conventional cigarette ', ' traditional cigarette ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' tobacco toxicant ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' tobacco products ', ' e-cigarette aerosols ', ' e-cig aerosols ', ' e-cig vapor ', ' e-cigarette vapor ', ' ecig aerosols ', ' ecig vapor ', ' ecigarette aerosols ', ' ecigarette vapor ', ' electronic cigarette aerosol ', ' electronic cigarette vapor ', ' 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol ', ' NNAL ', ' former smoker ', ' ex-smoker ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,204739
"Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences Abstract A major approach in causal inference literature aimed at mitigating bias due to unmeasured confounding is the so- called instrumental variable (IV) design which relies on identifying a variable which (i) influences the treatment process, (ii) has no direct effect on the outcome other than through the treatment, and (iii) is independent of any unmeasured confounder. IV methods are very well developed and widely used in social and health science, although validity of IV inferences may not be reliable if any of required assumptions (i)-(iii) is violated. This proposal aims to develop (a) new IV methods robust to violation of any of (i)-(iii); (b) New negative control methods that can be used to detect and sometimes to nonparametrically account for unmeasured confounding bias; (c) New bracketing methods for partial inference about causal effects in comparative interrupted time series studies. The proposed methods will be used to address current scientific queries in three major substantive public health areas:(1) to understand the health effects of air pollution; (2) to quantify the causal effects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders; (3) To uncover the mechanism by which a randomized package of interventions produced a substantial reduction of HIV incidence in a recent major cluster randomized trial of treatment as prevention in Botswana, Africa. Our proposal will provide the best available analytical methods to date to resolve confounding concerns in these high impact public health applications and more broadly in observational studies in the health sciences. Summary This proposal aims to develop new causal inference methods to tame bias due to hidden confounding factors in obser- vational studies as well as in randomized experiments subject to non-adherence.

"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding.

"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (“tele- SUD”) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (“tele-SUD”) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,10152467,R01DA048533,"['Adoption ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Communities ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' Methods ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural location ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Internet ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' combat ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' methamphetamine use ', ' METH use ', ' METH using ', ' methamphetamine using ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' improved outcome ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,913112
"A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning SUMMARY Adaptive evolution (AE) is both a “force of good” as it can help to optimize biological processes in industry, but it is also a “force of frustration” when infectious diseases exploit AE to escape the host immune system or become resistant to drugs. It has long been assumed close to impossible to make predictions on AE due to the presumed predominating influences of random forces and events. However, the observation that evolutionary repeatability across traits and species is far more common than previously thought, suggests that AE, with the right data and approach, may become (partially) predictable. Indeed, we found through experiments with the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae on its response to antibiotics and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, that in order to make AE predictable a detailed understanding of at least two aspects of the bacterial system are required: 1.) the genetic constraints of the system (i.e. the architecture of the organismal network); and 2.) where and how in the system stress is experienced and processed. We showed that by mapping out ~25% of the bacterium's network, determining phenotypic and transcriptional antibiotic responses, applying network analyses to capture and quantify the responses in a network context, and exploiting experimental evolution to pin-point adaptive mutations in the genome it becomes possible, by means of machine learning, to uncover hidden patterns in the data that make AE predictions feasible. This means that the network in interaction with the environment shapes the adaptive landscape, it limits available solutions and makes some solutions more likely than others, thereby driving repeatability and enabling predictability. In this proposal we build on these exciting developments with the goal to map out the constraints of S. pneumoniae's entire network and develop a machine learning model that can forecast adaptive evolution a priori, and on a genome-wide scale. To accomplish this, we combine in aim 1 parts of Tn-Seq, dTn-Seq and Drop-Seq to finalize a new tool Tn-Seq^2 (Tn-Seq squared) that is able to map genetic-interactions in high-throughput and genome-wide. We use Tn-Seq^2 to reconstruct the first genome-wide genetic interaction network for S. pneumoniae in the presence of 20 antibiotics. In aim 2 we create 85 HA-tagged Transcription factor induction (TFI) strains and: a) Determine with ChIP-Seq the DNA-binding sites for all 85 TFs in S. pneumoniae; b) By overexpressing each TFI strain followed by RNA- Seq we determine each TFs regulatory signature; c) Use a Transcriptional Regulator Induced Phenotype screen in the presence of 20 antibiotics to untangle environment specific links between genetic and transcriptional perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes. Lastly, in aim 3, we train and test a variety of machine learning approaches to design an optimal model that predicts which genes in the genome are most likely to adapt in the presence of a specific antibiotic. The development of this predictive AE model, will not only be useful in predicting the emergence of antibiotic resistance, but the strategy should be valuable for most any biological field for which adaptive changes are important, ranging from biological engineering to cancer. NARRATIVE Adaptive evolution (AE) is the driving force behind the emergence of antibiotic resistance and if it were possible to predict AE before it happens, it could help in preventing resistance. Here we use cutting-edge existing and newly designed genomics tools and analytical approaches to develop a machine learning model that can predict AE a priori, and on a genome-wide scale.",A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning,10155396,R01AI148470,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bacteria ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biomass ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E coli ', ' E. coli ', ' Evolution ', ' Fermentation ', ' Frustration ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Industry ', ' Maps ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Photosynthesis ', ' Streptococcus pneumoniae ', ' D pneumoniae ', ' D. pneumoniae ', ' Diplococcus pneumoniae ', ' Pneumococcus ', ' S pneumoniae ', ' S. pneumoniae ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Yeasts ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' immune drugs ', ' immune-based therapeutics ', ' immunologic preparation ', ' immunologic therapeutics ', ' immunotherapeutics ', ' immunotherapy agent ', ' Immunotherapeutic agent ', ' Genomics ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacteria pathogen ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' driving force ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' process optimization ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' network architecture ', ' genomic tools ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' droplet sequencing ', ' Drop-seq ', ' genetic architecture ', ' emerging antimicrobial resistance ', ' anti-microbial resistance emergence ', ' antimicrobial resistance emergence ', ' emerging anti-microbial resistance ', ' emerging antibiotic resistance ', ' antibiotic resistance emergence ', ' transposon sequencing ', ' Tn-seq ', ' Tnseq ', ' transposon insertion sequencing ', ' ']",NIAID,BOSTON COLLEGE,R01,2021,391250
"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point.

"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10149998,R21EB027891,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Movements ', ' air flow ', ' airflow ', ' airway obstruction ', ' airflow limitation ', ' airflow obstruction ', ' airway limitation ', ' obstructed airflow ', ' obstructed airway ', ' Airway Resistance ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Forced expiratory volume function ', ' FEVt ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume ', ' Timed Forced Vital Capacity ', ' Timed Vital Capacity ', ' Goals ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pressure ', ' Probability ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' Emphysema ', ' emphysematous ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Smoking ', ' Spirometry ', ' Stents ', ' Testing ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Trachea ', ' Trachea Proper ', ' windpipe ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' expiration ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Smoker ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Exhaling ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhalation ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' respiratory ', ' simulation ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' FEV1 ', ' FEV1%VC ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume 1 Test ', ' Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second ', ' PFT/FEV1 ', ' Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1 ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Smoking History ', ' pack years ', ' sex ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' Geometry ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' clinical predictors ', ' individual patient ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' cartilaginous ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Visualization ', ' respiratory morbidity ', ' former smoker ', ' ex-smoker ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2021,185497
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"Deep learning for population genetics Project Summary The revolution in genome sequencing technologies over the past 15 years has created an explosion of population genomic data but has left in its wake a gap in our ability to make sense of data at this scale. In particular, whereas population genetics as a field has been traditionally data-limited, the massive volume of current sequencing means that previously unanswerable questions may now be within reach. To capitalize on this flood of information we need new methods and modes of analysis.  In the past 5 years the world of machine learning has been revolutionized by the rise of deep neural networks. These so-called deep learning methods offer incredible flexibility as well as astounding improvements in performance for a wide array of machine learning tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This proposal aims to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference.  In recent years our group has made great strides in using supervised machine learning for population genomic analysis (reviewed in Schrider and Kern 2018). However, this work has focused primarily on using more traditional machine learning methods such as random forests. As we argue in this proposal, DNA sequence data are particularly well suited for modern deep learning techniques, and we demonstrate that the application of these methods can rapidly lead to state-of-the-art performance in very difficult population genetic tasks such as estimating rates of recombination. The power of these methods for handling genetic data stems in part from their ability to automatically learn to extract as much useful information as possible from an alignment of DNA sequences in order to solve the task at hand, rather than relying on one or more predefined summary statistics which are generally problem-specific and may omit information present in the raw data.  In this proposal we lay out a systematic approach for both empowering the field with these tools and understanding their shortcomings. In particular, we propose to design deep neural networks for solving population genetic problems, and incorporate successful networks into user-friendly software tools that will be shared with the community. We will also investigate a variety of methods for estimating the uncertainty of predictions produced by deep learning methods; this area is understudied in machine learning but of great importance to biological researchers who require an accurate measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding an estimate. Finally, we will explore the impact of training data misspecification—wherein the data used to train a machine learning method differ systematically from the data to which it will be applied in practice. We will devise techniques to mitigate the impact of such misspecification in order to ensure that our tools will be robust to the complications inherent in analyzing real genomic data sets. Together, these advances have the potential to transform the methodological landscape of population genetic inference. Project Narrative Deep learning has revolutionized such disparate fields as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In this proposal we aim to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference. We will design, implement, and apply novel deep learning methods and provide open source software for others to both use and build upon, thereby producing valuable tools for the genetics researchers at large.",Deep learning for population genetics,10147906,R01HG010774,"['Algorithms ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biology ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Population Explosions ', ' Program Development ', ' Publishing ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' empowered ', ' Performance ', ' speech recognition ', ' success ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' computational chemistry ', ' Genomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' stem ', ' tool development ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' network architecture ', ' genetic information ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' learning classifier ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,417279
"A system for long-term high-resolution 3D tracking of movement kinematics in freely behaving animals PROJECT SUMMARY The aim of this proposal is to deliver an innovative and easy-to-use experimental platform for measuring and quantifying naturalistic behaviors of mammalian animal models used for biomedical research, including rodents and monkeys, across a range of spatial and temporal scales. This will require developing a method for tracking movements freely behaving animals with far higher spatiotemporal resolution and more kinematic detail than currently possible. To overcome the limitations of current technologies, a new solution is proposed that synergistically combines two methods - marker based motion capture and a video- based machine learning approach. First, using marker-based motion capture, the gold standard for 3D tracking in humans, the position of experimental subjects' head, trunk, and limbs will be tracked in 3D with submillimeter precision. An innovative marker design, placement strategy, and post-processing pipeline will ensure an unprecedentedly detailed description of rodent behavior over a large range of timescales. To make the system more efficient, robust, affordable and better suited for high-throughput longitudinal studies, the unprecedentedly rich and large 3D datasets generated by the motion capture experiments will be leveraged to train a deep neural network to predict pose and appendage positions from a set of 1-6 normal video cameras. To best capitalize on the large training datasets, the latest advances in convolutional neural networks for image analysis will be incorporated. Together, these advances will promote generalization of the high-resolution 3D tracking system to a variety of animals and environments, thus establishing a cheap, flexible, and easy-to use kinematic tracking method that can easily be scaled up and adopted by other labs. The large ground-truth datasets will allow the system to be benchmarked and compared against state-of-the art technologies in quantitative and rigorous ways. Preliminary studies have been very positive and suggest large improvements over current methods both when it comes to the range of behaviors that can be tracked and the precision with which they can be measured. Importantly, all new technology will be readily shared with the scientific community, thereby leveraging from this single grant the potential for numerous investigators to dramatically improve the efficiency of their research programs requiring rigorous quantitative descriptions of animal behavior. Narrative We will develop and disseminate innovative new technology for measuring precise 3D kinematics in freely moving animals over long time-periods. Our proposed experimental platform will illuminate how natural behaviors are organized and help us understand how they are controlled by the nervous system, and how this control goes awry in disease. The technological leap made possible by this grant will catalyze a host of studies on the neural mechanisms underlying motor control, learning, and mental disorders, and thus help in the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for afflicted patients.",A system for long-term high-resolution 3D tracking of movement kinematics in freely behaving animals,10120068,R01GM136972,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Callithrix ', ' Hapale ', ' Marmosets ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Cephalometry ', ' head measurement ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Learning Disorders ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Logic ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Deer Mouse ', ' deermouse ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurological function ', ' nervous system function ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' skeletal ', ' Neurologic Deficit ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Performance ', ' appendage ', ' computer science ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' expectation ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' motor control ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic strategies ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Nervous System control ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,411071
"Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing 7. Project Summary/Abstract Adult human skin heals by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth restriction, and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options, no current treatment strategies successfully prevent or reverse this fibrotic process, and scars and their sequelae cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Progress towards the development of new therapies has been significantly hindered by a lack of understanding of the specific cell populations responsible for scarring. In 2015, our group reported that Engrailed-1 (En-1) lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are responsible for the vast majority of dorsal scar production in postnatal mice. In early fetal gestation, mice heal scarlessly via skin regeneration, an ideal outcome mediated by En-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs; the predominant fetal fibroblast). However, it has not been established if ENFs contribute to postnatal wound healing. In this proposal, we explore for the first time the postnatal conversion of ENFs to pro-fibrotic EPFs (postnatally-derived EPFs; pEPFs) within the wound environment. First, histology, immunohistochemistry, and wounding in a novel transgenic mouse model will be used to study the conversion of ENFs to pEPFs during wound healing. By examining the behavior of ENF subpopulations (derived from papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and hypodermis) in the wound environment and confirming our findings in a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model of En-1 activation, we will precisely define the ENF population that gives rise to pro-fibrotic pEPFs. Second, we will establish the specific wound environment cues that drive ENF-to-EPF transition. Given that mechanical forces are known to modulate both scar burden and fibroblast activity, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to examine the effects of mechanical environment on En-1 activation. We will further use transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to explore the role of mechanotransduction signaling in ENF-to-EPF transition and pEPF function. Third, having established a mechanotransduction mechanism underlying En-1 activation in wound ENFs, we will inhibit mechanotransduction signaling with the goal of blocking ENF-to-EPF transition. Specifically, we will assess whether blocking mechanotransduction results in ENF-mediated wound healing with reduced fibrosis. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop therapeutics that target fibrogenic fibroblasts to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of cutaneous scarring, inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapies, and shed light on the cellular origin of dermal scarring fibroblasts. 8. Project Narrative Scarring is the end result of injury in adult human skin and results in an enormous financial and medical burden for our society. There are currently no effective molecular therapies that prevent scarring or its sequelae, and development of therapeutics has been hindered by lack of understanding of the precise cell populations that mediate fibrosis in wound healing. Therefore, we propose to explore the contribution of a specific fibroblast subpopulation (Engrailed-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts; ENFs) in fibrotic wound healing, in order to inform novel directions for targeted treatments that minimize scarring and promote regenerative wound healing.",Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing,10130573,R01GM136659,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Behavior ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Collagen ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Cues ', ' Dermis ', ' Corium ', ' Cutis ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Histology ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' In Vitro ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Microscopy ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Mechanical Stress ', ' Tamoxifen ', ' Time ', ' tissue culture ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 ', ' PTK2 Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 ', ' endogenous substrate pp120 ', ' focal adhesion kinase ', ' focal adhesion protein tyrosine kinase ', ' focal adhesion-associated protein tyrosine kinase pp125FAK ', ' Transposase ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting ', ' Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting Fractionation ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sortings ', ' Measures ', ' Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV ', ' Adenosine Deaminase-Binding Proteins ', ' CD26 ', ' CD26 Antigens ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Papillary ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Dermal ', ' Hair follicle structure ', ' Hair Follicle ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' analog ', ' Subcutaneous Tissue ', ' Hypodermis ', ' Subcutis ', ' Superficial Fascia ', ' Tela Subcutanea ', ' subdermal tissue ', ' Engraftment ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' BPD verteporfin ', ' BPD-MA ', ' Benzoporphyrin Derivative Monoacid Ring A ', ' Visudyne ', ' benzoporphyrin D ', ' verteporphin ', ' Verteporfin ', ' postnatal ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' fetal ', ' Hydrogels ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Protein Inhibition ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Anatomic Surface ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' cell assay ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' reconstruction ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' wound ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' functional loss ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' regenerative ', ' skin regeneration ', ' regenerate skin ', ' skin healing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanosensing ', ' mechanical force ', ' skin wound ', ' cutaneous wound ', ' dermal wound ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' wound environment ', ' wound bed ', ' ']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,317427
"Novel computational approaches to predict drug response and combination effects Summary Tailoring the most desired therapy to each individual patient is the primary goal of precision medicine. A reliable and robust predictive model of drug effectiveness based on patients' unique genomic background is the key. For decades, communities have been trying to establish the relationship between molecular characteristics and drug response in complex diseases. Over the last decade, a large amount of genomic and epigenomic data together with pharmacogenomics data and response to perturbations data has been generated for many human cell lines through collaborations in the research community. These projects have led to significant therapeutic discoveries and have provided unprecedented opportunities to predict drug response using molecular fingerprints. However, even with great interest and effort in developing computational methods for predicting drug response, the prediction accuracies are at best only moderate. A related but distinct question is to understand the mechanisms of action (MOA) of drugs. Understanding drug MOAs enables characterization of drug side effects and identification of old drugs for new uses (i.e. drug repositioning). The traditional experimental assays to identify MOAs of drugs are expensive and time- consuming. There are three key questions to be addressed in the study. 1. Can novel computational approaches largely improve prediction accuracy of response to single drugs using comprehensive genomic and chemical information? 2. Can computational approaches provide a systematic way to mine genomics and drug response data to generate biological insights into the mechanisms of actions of various drugs? 3. Is it possible to develop an interpretable and accurate computation model to predict drug combination effects using pharmacogenomics data? Inherent features make it very challenging to predict drug response accurately: High-dimensionality of input data, the complex relationship between input features and response data; and heterogeneous drug/compound response patterns across different genetic lineages. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been making remarkable strides in various applications owing to the rapid progress of “deep learning. In Aim 1 of this study, we will develop novel AI-based approaches to address the computational challenges of improving the prediction accuracy of drug response. In Aim 2 of the study, we will develop a novel computation framework to study of MOA of drugs. In Aim 3, we will develop an interpretable deep-learning based computational framework to predict drug combination effects.

"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next

"Adaptive evolutionary inference frameworks for understudied populations using generative neural networks PROJECT SUMMARY In the field of population genetics, machine learning methods are emerging as promising frameworks for understanding evolution. However, these algorithms rely heavily on simulated datasets, which currently fail to recapitulate the features of diverse natural genomes. Deep neural networks in particular are disconnected from evolutionary modeling, and their results are difficult to interpret in a biological context. In this project, we propose to develop simulation frameworks that automatically adapt to any population or species. The resulting customized synthetic datasets will be used to train neural networks that quantify the unique evolutionary histories of understudied human groups. By including genealogical and epigenetic information as auxiliary input, we will be able to link predictions back to genomic features. Our results will enable us to estimate the interactions between local phenomena such as natural selection, mutation patterns, and recombination hotspots. Taken together, outcomes from our work will allow us to create a detailed model evolutionary of processes, both along the genome and across human populations.

"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief.

"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,10116306,R01CA218094,"['Animals ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antibody Affinity ', ' antigen antibody affinity ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Budgets ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Oligo ', ' oligos ', ' Fc Receptor ', ' antibody receptor ', ' Research ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Training ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Test Result ', ' Services ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' immune drugs ', ' immune-based therapeutics ', ' immunologic preparation ', ' immunologic therapeutics ', ' immunotherapeutics ', ' immunotherapy agent ', ' Immunotherapeutic agent ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Phage Display ', ' Update ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' Molecular Machines ', ' human disease ', ' iterative design ', ' commercialization ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' mathematical methods ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' cloud based ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' Immunize ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' antibody test ', ' antibody based test ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,591130
"Single cell quantification of genomic instability in cancer as a determinant of therapeutic response PROJECT ABSTRACT Tumor genetic heterogeneity is an extensive feature of cancer biology and underlies patient response to therapy. One aspect of tumor heterogeneity that has been difficult to study is heterogeneity of large genomic aberrations, including high level amplifications a few megabases in size, whole or partial chromosomal gains and losses and whole genome duplications. This is because identifying these aberrations in subclonal populations (present in <100% of cells) is extremely challenging when sequencing tumors in “bulk”. Single cell genomics however, can resolve these alterations at cellular resolution enabling precise quantification of heterogeneity at these genomic length scales. To comprehensively investigate the extent and consequences of intra-tumor heterogeneity generated by these types of genomic aberrations I will leverage recent advances in robust highly scalable single cell whole genome sequencing and my expertise in computational modeling. In the K99 phase of the award I will investigate how differences in the ability of cells to repair their genomes results in different patterns of genetic heterogeneity, and how such cellular diversity can cause differential response to treatment in high grade serous ovarian cancer, a cancer driven by genomic instability. In the independent phase of the award I will focus on heterogeneity and evolutionary dynamics of extra-chromosomal DNA, small circular pieces of DNA that cause high level amplification of oncogenes. The results of this proposal have the potential to give fundamental new insight into the biology of genomic instability and enable better predication of patient response to therapy and identification of therapeutic vulnerability that may be exploited. This proposal also describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator, combining computational modeling inspired by evolutionary theory, machine learning and high-resolution genomics to quantify cancer evolution in order to better predict patient response to therapy and uncover the mechanisms driving cancer progression. During the K99 phase I will be supported by an interdisciplinary team of experts in single cell genomics, cancer evolution, ovarian cancer biology and genomic instability. I will broaden my knowledge of machine learning, genomic instability and scalable bioinformatics software engineering and improve my communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this research proposal we will study how the instability inherent to the genomes of cancer cells impact patient response to therapy. We envisage that the results from this proposal will enable better prediction of patient response to therapy and reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities that may be exploited to design more effective

"Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM Project Summary/Abstract My laboratory's research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms key to the regulation of membrane protein function and to the modulation of their output signaling. We use cryo-EM and advanced classification methods, such as manifold embedding, combined with modeling and molecular dynamics to study how ligands produce shifts in conformation equilibria and bias signaling output. We are currently studying two systems that allow us to study how different types of ligands influence the gating of ion channels. We are studying the role of lipids in triggering gating of mechanosensitive channels of the MscS family, a model system of membrane tension-sensing which can yield important information about the fundamental principles governing ion channel gating and the role that lipid-protein interactions play in this process. We have a longstanding interest in the mechanism and modulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a calcium release channel fundamental to heart and skeletal function. We are using manifold embedding, a machine learning-based method to analyze cryo-EM images, to better understand how small molecules and ions such as calcium and ATP affect the conformational energy landscape of the channel. We aim to shed light on the gating mechanism of this very large ion channel, a prerequisite to understanding of its modulation by protein ligands, post-translational modifications and drugs. Our approach to these fundamental problems is to use a commbination of cryo-electron microscopy, advanced image classification techniques, modelling and molecular dynamics simulations to delineate allosteric pathways mechanistically and then test proposed models with biophysical methods such as single-channel measurements, HDX-MS and mutagenesis. Our ultimate aim is to greatly increase our molecular understanding of the gating and allosteric modulation of ion channels. Progress towards such knowledge has the potential to open the way for the design of small molecule allosteric modulators with very well controlled effects on their targets, aiding the development of drugs with limited side effects. A longer-term aim is to further develp and use our tools towards gaining a better understanding of allosteric modulation in other classes of membrane proteins of therapeutic importance. In particular, G protein-coupled receptor ligands can induce the selective binding of different transducers in a process called biased signaling. The molecular mechanisms at play in this process are still poorly understood despite their fundamental importance for the development of safer drugs. Project Narrative Ion channels are involved in a large number of vital processes, such as heart and muscle function for the ryanodine receptor and function of kidneys and regulation of blood pressure for mechanosensitive channels. This work focuses on understanding the function and regulation of ion channels. Better understanding of small ligand and lipid-protein interactions in these channels can lead more generally to a better understanding of ion channels function and to the design of drugs treating the numerous diseases associated with their malfunction.",Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM,10178048,R35GM133598,"['Affect ', ' Calcium ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Heart ', ' Ion Channel Gating ', ' Ion Channel Gatings ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ions ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligands ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lipids ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Membrane Protein Gene ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Play ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Transducers ', ' Work ', ' Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel ', ' Ca Release Channel-Ryanodine Receptor ', ' Calcium-Ryanodine Receptor Complex ', ' Ryanodine Receptor ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' base ', ' Muscle function ', ' heart function ', ' cardiac function ', ' function of the heart ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' skeletal ', ' interest ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' native protein drug ', ' pharmaceutical protein ', ' protein drug agent ', ' therapeutic protein ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIGMS,ADVANCED SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER,R35,2021,392500
"Vectra Polaris microscope imaging system PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks funding for a Vectra® Polaris™ Automated Quantitative Imaging System (Polaris™), a state- of-the-art multispectral imaging microscope to serve multiple NIH-supported projects within the Mycobacteria Research Laboratories (MRL) at Colorado State University (CSU). Our collective mission is to develop effective chemotherapies and vaccines for mycobacterial diseases affecting millions worldwide. The biological activity and safety profile of candidate vaccines and treatments can only be fully understood through characterizing the host immune response, primarily by evaluating large networks of immune biomarkers through flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. MRL researchers are seeking to visualize the spatial expression of immune biomarkers by multiplex staining of intact tissue samples obtained from preclinical models of mycobacterial diseases. Until now, microscopic analysis of biomarkers through confocal and traditional immunofluorescence was drastically limited by autofluorescence in tissue (especially in formalin fixed and diseased tissue) and low signal-to-noise ratios. The Polaris™ system has a unique set of microscopic capabilities that combined with the inForm® workstation allows simultaneous identification and quantification of multiple targets and their spatial relationships in tissue sections and microarrays. A critical aspect of the PolarisTM multispectral technology is the ability to readily distinguish autofluorescence from positive biomarker signal, improving the signal-to-noise ratio substantially. This allows for a more sensitive and accurate analysis of samples and enables true cell-to-cell interactions to be revealed. The system is user-friendly, and its automated scanning system allows for high speed digital and whole-slide scanning between 10-40x in brightfield or fluorescence. The nature of the illumination system significantly decreases deleterious effects such as photobleaching and photodamage, and thus specimens can be imaged for longer periods of time than with, for example, a confocal microscope. Furthermore, the advanced machine-learning based approaches of the included software automatically segment and quantitate tissue structures. The Polaris™ system will be incorporated into our existing microscopy core facility in order to expand access to trainees and other research groups at CSU and in Northern Colorado, while prioritizing access for the major users. Incorporation into the foundational core will sustain long term operation and provide consistent oversight and training. In summary, this state-of-the-art imaging technology is of critical importance to development of chemotherapies and vaccines by the MRL and will add value to multiple other NIH-supported projects at CSU. Narrative Here we will use multiplex staining of intact tissue samples and advanced machine-learning based approaches to understand the spatial relationships of biomarkers of disease and therapy. This knowledge will help in understanding immune pathogenesis of disease and in defining the biological activity and safety profile of candidate vaccines and chemotherapies.",Vectra Polaris microscope imaging system,10175807,S10OD030263,"['Affect ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Colorado ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Foundations ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mission ', ' Genus Mycobacterium ', ' Mycobacterium ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immunological markers ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Microscopic ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immune system response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' System ', ' mycobacterial ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Sampling ', ' Formalin ', ' Vectra ', ' liquid crystal polymer ', ' Photobleaching ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Core Facility ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' Imaging technology ', ' user-friendly ', ' chemotherapy ', ' spatial relationship ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' operation ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' ']",OD,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,S10,2021,451750
"Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development Summary The pathways involved in embryonic development have been a rich resource for understanding disease in adults, as well as being critically important in tracing the effects of genetic lesions and environmental poisons in the fetus. Frog embryos have been particularly useful due to the large size of the frog egg and embryo. New tools we developed for measuring the expression of RNA at a single-cell level, and advances in protein and phosphopeptide measurement technologies, offer hope for dramatic progress in understanding how signals involved in the maturation of the embryo direct individual cells to adopt specific fates. Our first goal is to define cell types using single-cell transcriptomics, and to define the lineages that result in specific cell types using high resolution temporal mappings. Targeted transcriptomics and proteomics of important molecules involved in specifying cell fate, such as transcription factors, will provide an index of the levels of signaling activity in each individual cell. This will result in an unprecedentedly detailed molecular picture of the factors involved in producing the phenotypes, and their interconversions from the early cleavage stage to the middle of organogenesis. The Xenopus model system allows us to dissect out portions of the early embryo that differentiate to ectoderm if not disturbed, called the animal cap. In the context of the embryo the cells in the animal cap receive a number of developmental signals, including Nodal, BMP, and Wnt. Combinations of these three signals (in different proportions) are capable of generating many of the major tissues. We will expose animal caps to a matrix of these three signals and trace the differentiation pathways that result, using single-cell RNA sequencing. This study of the molecular roots of differentiation decisions will be used to develop a mathematical approach, based on machine learning, to predicting the results of an attempted perturbation of the development of Xenopus. We will ask whether cell types are carefully specified by tightly controlled combinations of ligands or whether there are default states that are hard to escape from (""basins of attraction""), that therefore form the majority of embryonic cell types. The answer to this question is central to our understanding of how the Xenopus embryo reliably develops into a frog, and will accelerate efforts to create computational methods to predict the behavior of other biological pathways such as those involved in cancer. Narrative The complexity of biology makes it hard to predict what effect a mutation or a drug will have. We will use new tools to measure when genes are expressed at the individual cell level throughout the course of development of a vertebrate embryo. This will give us new information on the cell types involved in tissue and organ formation, and will provide an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that we will use to develop a mathematical model of how the decision to become a specific cell type is made.",Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development,10174971,R01HD073104,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' blastomere structure ', ' Blastocytes ', ' Embryonic Cell ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Ectoderm ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Evolution ', ' Fetus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligands ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' notochord ', ' Peptides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphopeptides ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Poison ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' toxic compound ', ' Proteins ', ' Rana ', ' Frog ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Xenopus ', ' Xenopus sp.

"Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Prashant K. Purohit, John L. Bassani, Valeri Barsegov and John W. Weisel The goal of this proposal is to explore and understand the fracture toughness of blood clots and thrombi, thus providing a mechanistic basis for life-threatening thrombotic embolization. A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering. Project Narrative The research objective of this proposal is to measure, model and predict the mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi at the molecular and continuum length scales.

"EFFICIENT METHODS FOR CALIBRATION, CLUSTERING, VISUALIZATION AND IMPUTATION OF LARGE scRNA-seq DATA Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to conduct detailed cellular analysis of cell subpopulations. Fulfilling the promise of scRNA-seq for biomedical studies and biomarker discovery requires robust computational approaches to support detection of rare phenotypes and unanticipated cellular responses. Current approaches for imputation, calibration, clustering and visualizing of scRNA-seq data suffer from challenges such as erroneous imputing of non-expressed genes, limitation of linear assumptions in removal of multivariate batch effects, and inefficiencies of clustering and dimensional reduction methods of very large datasets. We have developed spectral, neural network, and Fast Multipole Methods (FMM) prototypes suitable for addressing these issues in the context of scRNA-seq and other high throughput data contexts and propose to further develop and adapt these methods to scRNA-seq data analysis. Our team of experts on data analytics and computational biology is currently funded through the NIH BD2K initiative to develop novel big data tools and methods that have broad applicability to biomedical science. This effort proved the feasibility of extremely efficient scalable prototypes of neural network, spectral, and harmonic analysis techniques suitable for calibrating, reducing the dimensionality and visualizing high dimensional data, finding intrinsic state-probability densities, and co-organizing cells, markers and samples. We propose substantial advances over existing analytical procedures used in single cell RNA-seq studies including matrix recovery approaches for the sparse and noisy scRNA-seq data by combining matrix completion and statistical techniques (Aim 1A), and calibration based on our unsupervised MMD-ResNet neural network prototype and optimal transport theory (Aim 1B). We will develop a variant of the FMM approach to speed up the calculation of the repulsion term of the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique, which will improve our current fastest t-SNE FFT-based FIt-SNE prototype, and develop new reliable approximate nearest neighbors approaches to speed up the computation of the attraction term of t-SNE and other clustering algorithms (Aim 2A). Our additional variants of t-SNE will be further developed to allow better separation between clusters of cell subpopulations (late exaggeration) and better visualization using 1D t-SNE for heatmap gene-cell representation (Aim 2A). We will adapt SpectralNet, our efficient neural network approach, for computing graph Laplacian eigenvectors for large datasets. This will enable computation of spectral clustering, diffusion maps and manifold learning that are utilized in many scRNA studies but are currently limited to a moderate number of single cells (Aim 2B). Finally, we will develop a kernel based differential abundance algorithm to characterize differences between biological conditions (Aim 2C). We will adopt appropriate sampling approaches to significantly improve current methods. This research plan aims at developing scalable spectral computational and neural network tools suitable for analyzing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets. Specifically, our team which is led by a computational biologist, two prominent applied mathematicians and two prominent biologists will develop and validate scalable and novel techniques for: (i) completing missing values prevalent in these measurements, (ii) removing batch effect, (iii) reducing dimensionality and visualizing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets and enabling detection of rare cell populations as well as detecting minute changes of cell populations between biological conditions.

"Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. Despite efforts to characterize the pathophysiology of PTSD and its heterogenity, no objective biomarker have been established to aid in diagnosis, and prediction of treatment response. This K01 presents a program for research and training that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an independent investigator, focused on utilizing a data-driven computational approach and machine learning techniques to identify multimodal neural biomarkers of PTSD (supervised) and multimodal biotypes of PTSD (unsupervised) and explore whether such biotypes could be used to predict response to prolonged exposure (PE), the first line treatment for PTSD. The training plan builds on the candidate’s prior training and experience and capitalizes on a mentorship team and a research environment to foster development of the candidate’s expertise in 1) the neural and behavioral basis of PTSD and anxiety disorders; 2) multimodal data fusion analysis and latent dimension interpretation with data-driven computational approaches and data reproducibility; and 3) patient-oriented translational research in anxiety disorders. This research project will apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on multimodal MRI data from the largest existing PTSD dataset (N~3000 from the ENIGMA-PTSD working group). Biotypes identified from this large dataset will then be extended to clinical treatment data. The results of the proposed research will be vital to aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets and will lead to a future R01 grant examining brain-symptoms association across anxiety and trauma-related disorders, and to use the newly identified PTSD biotypes to inform different treatment outcomes in a following R61/33. Together, the research and training experiences and expertise developed through this K01 award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and ensure the applicant becomes a leading authority in the application of data-driven computational approaches in psychiatry research, and provide the basis for future NIMH grants to explore biotypes from multimodal brain imaging using data-driven computational approaches across anxiety-related disorders. PTSD can occur after a direct or indirect traumatic experience and is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. This research project use a big data and data-driven approaches to study the heterogenity of PTSD. In the long term, this line of research will aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets, which will advance the development of effective diagnostics and treatments for PTSD.",Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data

"A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth This project provides a data science framework and a toolbox of best practices for systematic and reproducible data-driven methods for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. Despite recent advances in methods for data-driven constructs, results are often hard to reproduce using samples from other studies. There is a lack of systematic statistical methods and analytical design for enhancing reproducibility. To fill this gap, we will develop a data science framework, including novel scalable algorithms and software, to derive and validate RDoC constructs. Although the proposed methods will generally apply to all RDoC domains and constructs, we focus specifically on furthering understanding of the RDoC domains of cognitive control (CC) and attention (ATT) constructs implicated in attention deficit disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Our application will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral, and clinical/self-report data from large, nationally representative samples from the on Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and multiple local clinical samples with ADHD and OCD. Specifically, using the baseline ABCD samples, in aim 1, we will apply and develop methods to assess and validate the current configuration of RDoC for CC and ATT using confirmatory latent variable modeling. We will implement and develop new unsupervised learning methods to construct new computational-driven, brain-based domains from multi-modal image data. In Aim 2, We will introduce network analysis (via Gaussian graphical models) to characterize heterogeneity in the interrelationship of RDoC measurements due to observed characteristics (i.e., age and sex). We will further model the heterogeneity of the population due to unobserved characteristics by introducing the data-driven precision phenotypes, which are the subgroup of participants with similar RDoC dimensions. We propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Generative Model and scalable algorithm for simultaneous dimension reduction and identify precision phenotypes. The model also serves as a tool to transfer information from the community sample ABCD to local clinical enriched studies. In aim 3, we will utilize the follow-up samples from ABCD and local clinical enriched data sets to validate the results from Aims 1 and 2 and assess the clinical utility of the precision phenotypes in predicting psychological development in follow-up time. Our project will provide a suite of analytical tools to validate existing RDoC constructs and derive new, reproducible constructs by accounting for various sources of heterogeneity. To advance the understanding of psychopathology using dimensional constructs of measurements from multiple units of analysis, we propose reproducible statistical framework for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. We will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral and clinical/self-report data from multiple samples to develop this framework. The design of our study consists of analyzing large, nationally representative samples, validating the results in local clinically enriched samples, and transfer information from the large community samples to local clinical samples.",A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth,10250553,R01MH124106,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chronology ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Attention Deficit Disorder ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' independent component analysis ', ' 11 year old ', ' 11 years of age ', ' age 11 years ', ' eleven year old ', ' eleven years of age ', ' analytical tool ', ' cognitive control ', ' network models ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' cognitive development ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Data Science ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' biological sex ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,660324
"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,10259872,P50AR070590,"['Psoriatic Arthritis ', ' Arthritic Psoriasis ', '

"Evolution-guided machine learning for inferring natural selection Project Summary/Abstract A fundamental question in genomics is to understand natural selection on coding and noncoding sequences. Signatures of natural selection encoded in polymorphism and divergence data not only elucidate the patterns of evolution but also pinpoint deleterious genetic variants responsible for genetic disorders. While numerous com- putational methods have been developed to infer sequences under various types of natural selection, the existing methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, most of the methods for inferring natural selection focus on an- alyzing individual loci. Due to the intrinsic sparsity of polymorphism and divergence data, the single-locus-based approaches are often underpowered. Second, when multiple genomic features are correlated with signatures of natural selection, the existing methods are incapable of distinguishing causal genomic features from corre- lated confounders. Due to these limitations, we still lack powerful computational frameworks to identify loci and genomic features responsible for natural selection. During the next ﬁve years, l will address the limitations of exist- ing methods by combining evolutionary models and ﬂexible machine learning techniques. Speciﬁcally, I formulate the inference of natural selection as a special regression problem in which genomic features are input covariates whereas polymorphism and divergence data are response variables. Based on this idea, my lab will develop a suite of evolution-guided machine learning models to infer negative, positive, and lineage-speciﬁc selection. These customized machine learning models will boost the statistical power of selection inference by pooling data across large numbers of loci, and will be able to distinguish genomic determinants from confounders. These new models will be applied to investigate various types of natural selection in the human genome. In addition, a genome-wide map of deleterious variants under strong negative selection will be developed for accurate variant prioritization. The proposed research builds on my recent work for predicting functional noncoding sequences, inferring selection coefﬁcients of coding variants, and unifying variant-level and gene-level prioritization methods. It will illustrate new insights into genomic determinants of functional sequences and human adaptive evolution, and will provide powerful computational tools for identifying disease mutations. It could also serve as a basis for the emerging paradigm of combining classical evolutionary theory and machine learning methods to address a variety of questions in evolutionary biology. Project Narrative Natural selection is a fundamental force of evolution and a hallmark of functional sequences. However, it is challenging to identify loci and genomic features responsible for natural selection due to the intrinsic sparsity of polymorphism and divergence data at a single locus. By combining evolutionary models and machine learning techniques, we can infer loci under natural selection at an unprecedented resolution, distinguish genomic deter- minants of natural selection from confounders, and accurately identify pathogenic variants from the footprints of negative selection.",Evolution-guided machine learning for inferring natural selection,10273742,R35GM142560,"['Biology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Research ', ' Work ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' genetic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' genome-wide ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Data Pooling ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R35,2021,373274
"Statistical and Machine Learning Methods to Address Biomedical Challenges for Integrating Multi-view Data Project Summary Many diseases are complex, heterogeneous, conditions that affect multiple organs in the body and depend on the interplay between several factors that include genetic, cellular, molecular, and environmental factors. It is therefore not surprising that the pathogenesis of many complex diseases remain elusive, and therapeutic targets are lacking. The traditional approach that focus on a small number of molecules (e.g., genes or metabolites) or a single type of data (e.g., clinical or genetic) cannot address this complexity and heterogeneity. Integrative or systems biology approaches and network analysis can be used to leverage the strengths of data from multiple sources (e.g., genomics, metabolomics, epidemiology, clinical data) to achieve new insights into the pathobiology of complex diseases. Recent technological advances have enabled the production of vast amounts of diverse but related data with rich information that offer remarkable opportunities to understand biological processes involved in complex diseases and to transform medicine, yet at the same time present signiﬁcant analytical challenges including how to effectively synthesize information from the tens of thousands of data points to identify important biomarkers with potential to serve as therapeutic targets. To alleviate this, we will develop and apply a suite of novel, robust, and powerful statistical and machine learning methods for the integration and interpretation of cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources. These models will also be used to deﬁne subpopulations of patients who have different prognoses or require different therapeutic approaches based on data from different sources. Further, we will make use of recent advances in network theory to model the complex multilateral relationships in molecular data from multiple sources. The proposed methods will be applied to several publicly available datasets and cohorts to ensure that we can generalize our work to other datasets and cohorts and thus increase the long-term impact of our research. The proposed research will also contribute valuable statistical and machine learning algorithms that will be broadly applicable to data from multiple sources and multiple cohorts and will be made available to the public free of charge. Project Narrative This proposed research is expected to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and personalized care through the integration and interpretation of cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources; it will contribute valuable tools and methods with potential for identiﬁcation of novel molecular targets for therapeutic interventions and for discovery of novel disease subtypes for improved patient prognosis.",Statistical and Machine Learning Methods to Address Biomedical Challenges for Integrating Multi-view Data,10274846,R35GM142695,"['Affect ', ' Charge ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Genomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Molecular ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' personalized care ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multiple data sources ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R35,2021,351514
"Biomarking IBD patient-specific disease features using the epithelial antigenic peptidome Project Summary/Abstract  In immune-mediated diseases such as type1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets. However, with the focus on genetics, inflammatory effectors, and microbiome, there has not been a modern search for such antibody biomarkers and the potential contribution of anti-epithelial autoimmunity in IBD. This project tests the hypothesis that ulcerative colitis phenotypes are distinguished by autoantibodies to mucosal epithelial proteins, addressed in two aims.  In the first aim, we apply the innovative peptide expression display (PED) technology to display and analyze the antigenic epithelial peptidome. This includes bioinformatically determining a comprehensive tabulation of human proteins with high likelihood for antigenicity and ileal-colonic epithelial expression; and, representing these proteins as tiled peptide epitopes with linked cognate oligonucleotides suitable for NGS-based identification and quantitation.  In the second aim, we will assess archival sera of 654 well-characterized colonic IBD patients and non-IBD controls to quantitate individual profiles of epithelial protein binding in relation to two outcomes of ulcerative colitis (UC). The significance of the project has been endorsed by the IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC), which made the UC colectomy cohort a research priority, and will collaborate with this R21 via archival serum samples and associated genetics and clinical metadata from the consortium UC patients and controls. Our primary study will compare 300 UC subjects, equally divided into severe and mild phenotypes of outcome based on time to colectomy. Our secondary study will compare 154 UC post-colectomy pouch patients, divided into severe and absent pouchitis phenotypes. We will also study two age-matched reference populations. Bioinformatic analyses will test for shared peptide specificities associated with disease state (UC vs. non-IBD controls) and each of the two extreme phenotypes (severe vs. mild UC; chronic pouchitis vs. late non-pouchitis). We also will perform exploratory tests for the role of IBD predictive risk scores and select genetic loci on autoantibody specificities.  If successful, this project will establish feasibility for the hypothesis, and foundational targets to pursue mechanistic and clinical biomarker studies that may validate and refine its implications for IBD pathogenesis and clinical applications. Project narrative In immune-mediated diseases such as type-1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets.
