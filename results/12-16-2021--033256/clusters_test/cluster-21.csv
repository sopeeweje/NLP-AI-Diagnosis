"Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI Project Summary/Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool both clinically and in scientific research, with broad applications ranging from cognitive neuroscience to presurgical planning. FMRI can generate whole brain neuronal activation maps, yet it is an inherently low signal to noise ratio (SNR) method due to the relatively small changes in activation signal relative to the baseline signal. The overarching goal of this project is to develop and validate robust, high SNR fMRI by using a novel acquisition method, oscillating steady state (OSS) fMRI, along with machine learning (ML) techniques, to reconstruct high-quality images of the OSS fMRI data. OSS fMRI can increase SNR by >2x compared to the current state-of-the-art in fMRI acquisition methods, and this boost is roughly equivalent to the SNR gain going from a 3T MRI scanner to a 7T MRI scanner. The SNR increase is a direct result of the steady state approach. However, with a more complex, oscillating acquisition, OSS fMRI can be more susceptible to common MRI artifacts than traditional methods if left uncorrected. Two of the most common sources of MRI artifacts are changes in the main magnetic field (B0) due to physiological noise (such as respiration) and patient motion. This project will develop robust, high SNR fMRI at 3T by incorporating the effects of (1) B0 changes and (2) patient motion into the OSS signal model and image reconstruction algorithms. A new image reconstruction that incorporates neural networks will correct for B0 fluctuations and remove B0 induced artifacts. We will train a neural network to generate B0 field maps using data from a conventional, physics-based two echo field mapping technique to implicitly incorporate prior information of the physics into the reconstruction, while also providing a fast, ML-based field mapping method. To correct for subject motion, we will develop a neural network that estimates rigid-body motion parameters from sequential image frames in the fMRI scan. These motion parameters will be used in an iterative image reconstruction to produce high-quality resting-state and task-based fMRI, even in the presence of subject motion. The technology developed in this proposal will result in improved functional MRI that has the potential to significantly advance both the study of the human brain and the treatment of neurological disorders. The University of Michigan is one of the top research universities in the US, and provides an ideal environment and infrastructure to complete the proposed research strategy. The Functional Magnetic Resonance Laboratory and the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at UM have all the necessary hardware and computational resources needed for this project, including two state-of-the-art GE 3T MRI scanners and extensive GPU hardware for the machine learning components of the project. Furthermore, Drs. Jeffrey Fessler and Douglas Noll have proven expertise in fMRI image acquisition and reconstruction, as well as extensive mentorship experience, that will help guide this project and my training. Project Narrative Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to measure brain function, and it has revolutionized our understanding of cognitive processes during the last 25 years and has also been used as a tool for presurgical mapping of language and other sensitive brain regions. More recently, fMRI is being used as a biomarker for the progression of neurologic and psychiatric diseases, for example, in Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and major depression. In this project we will improve fMRI techniques by developing new methods that are more robust to common sources of MRI image degradation, which will improve the sharpness of the fMRI images without increasing instrumentation costs.","Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI",10196983,F32EB029289,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Dictionary ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' instrumentation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Motion ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Research ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Rest ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Echo-Planar Imaging ', ' Echo-Planar Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Echoplanar Imaging ', ' Echoplanar Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Planar Medical Imaging ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Head Movements ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' magnetic field ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Neurologic Process ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' open source ', ' progression marker ', ' progression biomarker ', ' cognitive process ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2021,66390
"Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation therapy is one of the major approaches for cancer treatment. Treatment planning, the process of designing the optimal treatment plan for each patient, is one of the most critical steps. If a treatment is poorly designed, a satisfactory outcome cannot be achieved, regardless of the quality of other treatment steps. Treatment planning in modern radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem defined by a set of hyperparameters. While there exists several quantifiable metrics to quantify plan quality and guide the planning process, these are simplified representations that cannot fully describe the physician’s intent. In addition, these metrics only measure plan quality from a population-based perspective, and cannot guide treatment planning to achieve the patient-specific best treatment plans. Hence, the best physician-preferred solution often sits in a gray area, only achievable by an extensive trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning process and interactions between the planner and physician. Consequently, planning time can take up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor, if the planner is inexperienced and/or under heavy time constraints. These consequences substantially deteriorate treatment outcomes, as having been clearly demonstrated in clinical studies. Recently, the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in imitation learning allows human- like decision making by observing a human expert’s actions and internally building its own decision-making system. In response to PAR-18-530, the goal of this project is to develop and translate an AI planner that mimics human experts’ behavior to generate a high quality plan. The AI planner will not replace human planners. Instead, the AI plan will be used as a starting point in the current planning process to improve plan quality and planning efficiency. The human planner’s actions on further plan improvement can feed back to the AI planner through continuous learning for its continuous evolution. We will pursue this goal using prostate cancer as the test bed through an academic-industrial partnership, jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc. The following specific aims are defined. Aim 1: Model and algorithm development. We will collect experts’ behavior data in routine treatment planning and train the AI planner. Aim 2: System validation and translation. We will integrate the AI planner into Varian Eclipse treatment planning system and validate the system in a clinically realistic setting. The innovations include the use of a state-of-the-art AI imitation learning algorithm to solve a clinically important problem, the novel technological capabilities enabled by the developed system, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end users. Deliverability is ensured by extensive preliminary studies and the partnership integrating complementary expertise and resources. Clinical translation of the AI planner will bring substantial impacts to radiotherapy by providing high-quality and efficient treatment planning to benefit patients, especially those in resource-limited regions. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. Jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc, this project will develop and translate an artificial intelligence planner that is capable of efficiently generating high quality treatment plans.",Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning,10143143,R01CA254377,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Due Process ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' model development ', ' Treatment Step ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Scheme ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' head and neck cancer patient ', ' HNC patient ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' chemotherapy ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' population based ', ' treatment strategy ', ' routine practice ', ' product development ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' learning progression ', ' continuous learning ', ' individual patient ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' clinical translation ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' learning algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' ']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,626797
"Pathomic Predictors of Prostate Cancer Progression Abstract  Recent studies suggest that in the U.S. prostate cancer is over-detected and over-treated resulting in significant morbidity and financial costs. These problems are the product of poor sensitivity and specificity serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as a screening tool, leading to unnecessary biopsies that find small and predominantly indolent prostate tumors. While many prostate cancers should be managed with active surveillance, uncertainties surrounding available clinical tools of aggressiveness (such as PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage) will often drive patients and physicians to treatment. Attempts to improve prognostication using candidate biomarkers, mostly discovered from genomic analyses of large pieces of cancers, have had few successes, and available molecular tools provide only modest prediction, at best. An alternative to the genomic driver focus is that a combination of molecular events, under the influence of the tumor microenvironment, drive tumor’s molecular evolution and progression. Consequently, analysis of tumor characteristics detectable in pathomic data, such as heterogeneity of expression subtypes, amount of stroma, extent of microenvironmental heterogeneity, extent of immune infiltration, or extent of hypoxia, may ultimately lead to better patient stratification. Our proposal fundamentally centers around the most critical clinical question in early prostate cancer that is the basis for clinical decision making: Can we identify proteomic, imaging, and/or microenvironment features that distinguish those aggressive cancers that will progress to cause harm from benign cancers that can be safely monitored by watchful waiting?  To examine the links between the heterogeneity of early, screen-detected prostate cancers and likelihood of progression, we will interrogate a retrospective set of 225 prostatectomy patients. In Aim 1, we will use GE’s hyperplexed immune-pathology platform (Cell DIVE) to profile over 50 proteins at the cellular and subcellular level along with matrix components that define the microenvironments with the cells present in this matrix. In Aim 2, we will focus on single-cell level data and systematically extract the prevalence of the diverse cell subtypes found within these tumors. Cells will be typed along traditional axes (e.g. epithelial, CD4+ T-cells). In addition, we will use molecular and structural characteristics to define novel subtypes. Features associated with cell types (e.g. existence, prevalence, diversity) will be used alone and in combination with Gleason grading to distinguish patients with aggressive tumors that are likely to progress. Aim 3 will focus on neighborhood and regional analyses, particularly on developing approaches to extract tumor microenvironmental characteristics that have demonstrated linkages to progression (hypoxia, stromal reactivity, immune cell patterning). Using a diverse set of these features, alongside deep learning techniques on primary images, we will develop classifiers distinguishing aggressive and benign tumors. Finally, in Aim 4 we will validate classifiers in large cohorts. Project Narrative  Our proposal fundamentally centers around the most critical clinical question in early prostate cancer that is the basis for clinical decision making; namely, can we identify proteomic, imaging, and/or microenvironment features that distinguish those aggressive cancers that will progress to cause harm from benign cancers that can be safely monitored by watchful waiting?",Pathomic Predictors of Prostate Cancer Progression,10146314,R01CA249899,"['Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Financial cost ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Morbidity -

"Low-Field High-Performance MRI for Screening Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and is the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related mortality in males in the United States. Despite high incidence and tremendous human and economic impact of PCa, there is no good screening test for clinically significant PCa. Commonly used blood test for Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is inexpensive but lack specificity for clinically significant PCa. Over the last decade, multi- parametric prostate MRI has been shown to have an increasingly important role in the detection and localization of clinically significant PCa. Despite the demonstrated value of prostate MRI, there are two major challenges in clinical implementation of prostate MRI as a first-line screening tool at a population level: (1) high cost of the scanner and the exam, which decreases accessibility, and (2) lack of robustness of the MRI exam. To overcome these limitations we propose establishing a low-field, robust, widely accessible, and thus low- cost high-performance MRI system for PCa screening. Major challenges for imaging at lower field strength is the lower signal to noise (SNR) and thus longer acquisition times compared to 1.5 and 3.0 T. In this proposal we aim to address these efficiency and scan time challenges at low field. Our team of clinical and imaging scientists will bring to bear novel acquisition and reconstruction techniques to restore SNR, specifically random matrix theory (RMT- a technique our center has recently introduced), and deep-learning- based image reconstruction (an area our group has helped to pioneer). We will evaluate these techniques in healthy volunteers and patients with PCa. Subsequently, we will perform head-to-head comparison of low-field bi-parametric exam to routine clinical 1.5 T or 3.0 T MRI exams in 30 patients with known or suspected PCa. Project Narrative Although Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer- related mortality in men in the U.S., there is a lack of a good screening test for clinically significant PCa. Multi- parametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an increasingly important role in detecting and localizing clinically significant PCa, but cost and accessibility of conventional MRI limits its use as a first-line screening test. Therefore, we propose establishing a low-field, robust, accessible, and thus low-cost, high- performance MRI methodology for screening clinically significant PCa.",Low-Field High-Performance MRI for Screening Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer,10111669,R21CA256324,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Amplifiers ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Diffusion ', ' Fellowship ', ' Gases ', ' Helium ', ' He element ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Incidence ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Ownership ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Seminin ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' radiologist ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' detect prostate cancer ', ' prostate cancer detection ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' economic impact ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' cancer care ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' volunteer ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' prototype ', ' PSA screening ', ' PSA test ', ' prostate specific antigen screening ', ' prostate specific antigen test ', ' operation ', ' head-to-head comparison ', ' head-to-head analysis ', ' screening ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' imaging system ', ' imaging scientist ', ' clinical implementation ', ' deep learning ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' screening guidelines ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' prostate lesions ', ' prostatic lesions ', ' cost estimate ', ' cost estimation ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,237724
"Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most widespread non-traumatic, demyelinating disorder in young adults. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aids in both diagnosing MS and assisting clinical management of patients. In addition to focal MS lesions, diffusely abnormal white matter (DAWM) is also seen on brain MRI in MS patients. While not understood completely, DAWM is thought to be a predictor of disease burden, possibly appears early on in the disease, and may be a marker of neurodegeneration in MS. However, longitudinal studies of DAWM are lacking, and segmentation of DAWM is manual, making it difficult to study the evolution of DAWM. The main objective of this proposal is to longitudinally study the development of DAWM in MS. This objective will be realized by analyzing preexisting longitudinal MRI data acquired on 1008 MS patients who participated in phase 3, blinded, multi-center clinical trial, referred to as CombiRx that was supported by NIH. The CombiRx data includes multi-contrast MRI and various clinical measures. Automatic identification of DAWM is a critical component of this proposal. Based on our preliminary studies, deep Learning (a class of machine learning algorithms) has the potential to automatically identify DAWM and estimate its volume. We will use the large CombiRx MRI data for training, validation, and testing of the deep learning models, and to study DAWM evolution in this MS cohort. The proposal has two major aims. In the first aim we will develop a deep learning model based on fully-convolutional neural networks for automatic segmentation of DAWM, gray matter, normal appearing white matter, and T2-hyperintense lesions guided by manual segmentation of two neuroimaging experts. In the second aim we will segment DAWM and all brain tissues, including focal lesions, at baseline and all available follow-up scans in the CombiRx cohort (up to 6.5 years). The temporal changes in volume, location, and MRI parameters of DAWM and focal T2 lesions will be computed. We will finally test whether DAWM is precursor to focal T2 lesions, associated with T2 lesion resolution, or a separate disease process altogether. If DAWM is shown to occur early on in the disease, it is possible to intervene sooner for improved outcome. Similarly, if DAWM is shown to be related to disease activity, it can serve as an objective and quantitative measure of the disease. Such an objective measurement would be highly valuable in developing targeted therapies and also in evaluating the treatment effect in MS patients. The main objective of this proposal is to study the evolution of diffusely appearing white matter (DAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) using a novel deep learning approach. The results of this study are expected to be highly valuable in evaluating the treatment effect in individual MS patients. These results can also help reduce time and money in conducting clinical trials substantially, which would lead to early introduction of promising drugs into the market. Finally, if DAWM occurs early on in the disease, as suggested by some of the publications, it is possible to therapeutically intervene sooner for improved outcome.",Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach,10217627,R21NS118320,"['Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Demyelinating Diseases ', ' Demyelinating Disorders ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Gliosis ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Histology ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Reporting ', ' Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Modeling ', ' model development ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' Multiple Sclerosis Lesions ', ' MS Lesions ', ' axonopathy ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment effect ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' multiple sclerosis patient ', ' MS patient ', ' patients with MS ', ' patients with multiple sclerosis ', ' improved outcome ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,234000
"FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening Abstract: Imaging of the human brain has seen explosive growth in the last two decades mainly through the various modalities of MRI. The massive amount of data requires automatic and robust tools for analysis. FreeSurfer (FS, surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) is one of the preeminent tools used for neuroimage analysis. FS has more than 44,000 downloads, and the core FS manuscripts have been cited more than 22,000 times. FS is part of the analysis core for many NIH-funded large-scale data acquisition projects such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD), as well as the UK BioBank. One third of the 600+ ADNI-based publications cite FS. Simply put, much of the innovative research done in neuroimaging would not be possible without FS. Started in 1998, FS is best known for providing detailed and automated anatomical analysis of T1-weighted MRI images, especially for the cortical surface. However, FS anatomical analysis provides an ideal substrate for all modes of brain imaging including functional MRI, diffusion MRI, PET, optical/NIRS, as well as EEG/MEG. FS provides tools to perform these analyses as well as software to integrate with other analysis tools (e.g., SPM, FSL, AFNI). FS has been used for presurgical planning and even in the operating room.  The original grant mostly centered around Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation (SAMSEG). SAMSEG uses parametric Bayesian generative modeling to segment brain images. The SAMSEG framework fits atlas priors and multivariate Gaussian intensity models to brain images (including MRI artifacts such as bias fields). SAMSEG can take any modality or combination of modalities as input. Since it adapts its intensity model, it is robust to differences in scanner. Since it is a generative model, it is easy to extend to encompass more segmentation details. For example, the SAMSEG framework has been used to segment hippocampal subfield, amygdalar nuclei, thalamic nuclei, and extracerebral structures.  The main vision for the renewal is to extend the SAMSEG framework to accommodate longitudinal models, incorporate more anatomical details, and to use SAMSEG output as a basis for cortical surface placement that is, like SAMSEG, modality independent and capable of using any combination of modalities. In addition, we propose a series of new tools that will assist in the individual and group analysis of large studies by creating study-specific models. In addition to this new technical development, we are requesting support for software engineering, maintenance, and user support – mundane and not innovative, but high-impact this type of support is critical to the thousands of researchers who rely on FreeSurfer. Narrative: This work will support the popular FreeSurfer neuroimaging analysis software program used by thousands of researchers world-wide. FreeSurfer uses cutting edge algorithms to automatically extract a host of biomarkers from brain imaging data which can be used for research, pharmaceutical evaluation, and diagnosis. This proposal will allow for continued support of FreeSurfer from the developers as well as new development to make FreeSurfer faster, more robust, and easier to interpret.","FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening",10130964,R01EB023281,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Atlases ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Engineering ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industrialization ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maintenance ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Probability ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic Nuclei ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' base ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Surface ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Stream ', ' System ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Free Will ', ' Documentation ', ' Leukoaraiosis ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' Multiple Sclerosis Lesions ', ' MS Lesions ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' data acquisition ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' cognitive development ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' connectome ', ' human imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' large scale data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' ']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555356
"Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer Project Summary Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard of care for early stage (≥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point. Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1) Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients (≥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study, a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to appropriate treatment at an earlier time point. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer amongst women and treatment decisions are based heavily on accurate and early imaging. By developing a technique that evaluates response to treatment earlier than the current standard of care, we will decrease morbidity and mortality by treating cervical cancer at an earlier time point, preventing further progression of disease. The development of new biomedical imaging techniques to fundamentally improve the detection and treatment of disease is directly relevant to one of the key missions of the NIH.",Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer,10121726,R37CA249659,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Cervix ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Infertility ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' fertility cessation ', ' fertility loss ', ' infertile ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"MRI Imaging and Biomarkers for Early Detection of Aggressive Prostate Cancer Abstract  Oversampling and overdiagnosis of prostate cancer are significant management and cost issues that burden our health care system and the individual at risk with unnecessary biopsies and potential complications. The proposed studies will validate recent advances in quantitative prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) techniques, blood biomarkers of aggressive prostate cancer and radiogenomics that relate to increased aggressive cancer risk by our group and collaborators. The overarching goal is to increase the negative predictive value (NPV) for significant prostate cancer and consequently reduce unnecessary biopsies. Central to the proposal are key collaborations between investigators from the Consortium for Imaging and Biomarkers (CIB), Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), and Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL).  Novel automated techniques for quantitative analysis of mpMRI that identify prostate habitats at risk of harboring significant prostate cancer (Gleason score 3+4 and above or Grade Group (GG)2+) will be combined with improvements in mpMRI-ultrasound fusion biopsies. Our automated pixel-by-pixel 3D prostate habitat risk scoring (HRS) system is superior to the standard prostate lesion classification system, PIRADSv2, and is hypothesized to improve the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for significant GG2+ cancers (Aim 1). Radiomics will be applied in Aim 1 to refine HRS in the University of Miami MDSelect protocol of 250 men (discovery=150; validation=100).  Just as PIRADSv2 is suboptimal because it does not incorporate quantitative imaging information in risk stratification, models of risk based only on histopathologic grading ignore the underlying genomic determinants of outcome. We have shown that radiomics features are associated with underlying gene expression markers of adverse outcome. We propose in Aim 2 to apply newer criteria that incorporate Decipher® score with clinical-pathologic factors to improve the identification of aggressive prostate cancer. Radiomic features associated with these published criteria, termed the Spratt criteria, will improve the NPV for nonaggressive prostate cancer in the MDSelect cohort.  We will also collaborate with investigators involved in the EDRN ID-430 clinical trial to test our models in a cohort (n=200) in a less rigorously controlled multi-institutional group with more variability in imaging techniques, vendors and machines.  There is also opportunity to further improve risk classification through the analysis of blood-based markers (Aim 3) such as 4Kscore, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating cancer associated macrophage like (CAML) cells that are early biomarkers of aggressive cancer. The proposed work will test the incremental benefit of adding these serum-based biomarkers to improve the NPV models for significant prostate cancer. Narrative  Oversampling and over-diagnosis of prostate cancer are significant management and cost issues that burden our health care system and the individual at risk with unnecessary biopsies and potential complications. The proposed work will combine quantitative imaging features, informed by tumor grade and gene expression, with blood based biomarkers into an objective, automated, tool optimized to achieve a high negative predictive value for significant cancer in undiagnosed men referred for prostate biopsy. Two cohorts, one from the University of Miami (“MDSelect”) and the other from the EDRN will be used to validate/extend that the developed mpMRI based habitat risk scoring system is superior to the more standard PIRADSv2 in identifying significant cancers in the prostate.",MRI Imaging and Biomarkers for Early Detection of Aggressive Prostate Cancer,10249261,U01CA239141,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Fluids ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Evolution ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' macrophage ', ' Mφ ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Neoplasm Circulating Cells ', ' circulating neoplastic cell ', ' circulating tumor cell ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostatectomy ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' rectal ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Lesion ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Indolent ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Screening for Prostate Cancer ', ' detect prostate cancer ', ' prostate cancer detection ', ' prostate cancer early detection ', ' Collaborations ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Habitats ', ' Genomics ', ' Histologic Grade ', ' Histopathologic Grade ', ' Gland ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' EDRN ', ' National Detection Research Network ', ' Early Detection Research Network ', ' Multiparametric Analysis ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' urinary ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Radiogenomics ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' radiomics ', ' blood-based biomarker ', ' blood-based marker ', ' genomic signature ', ' genomic classifier ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' deep learning ', ' prostate lesions ', ' prostatic lesions ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2021,820480
"Development of a Multimodal Deep Learning Model for the Generation of Cancer Probability Maps and Imaging Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer using Multiparametric MRI Project Summary/Abstract Background: Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most common newly diagnosed cancer and second deadliest cancer in American men. There is a large discrepancy between the incidence of the disease and its mortality rate. Thus, the development of screening tools to identify prostate cancer and determine if it is aggressive or indolent is an area of considerable interest. Current methods rely on the use of serum biomarkers and follow-up biopsies for screening. However, there is substantial debate as to the appropriate methodology for screening. The goal of this proposal is the development of: 1) new imaging biomarkers (i.e., “features”) for prostate cancer; and 2) a novel predictive model for the presence of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma. These tools will enable more effective use of mp-MRI in prostate cancer screening in the future and thus enable a future improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of screening, reducing the rates of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis. Aim 1: To implement a deep learning algorithm for clinical prostate mp-MRI sequences, creating a cancer prob- ability map that is predictive of biopsy results. Aim 2: To create a multimodal framework that will combine discovered imaging features with clinical data points from the medical record (e.g., age, risk factors, medical history, biomarkers) to predict the presence and aggressiveness of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Methods: In Aim 1, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) will be trained on a clinical dataset comprised of patches extracted from pre-prostatectomy mp-MRI sequences from patients with prostate cancer, using his- topathology analysis of whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens as ground truth. The innovations in this aim will be the development of a CNN that can simultaneously learn from three different imaging sequence types, the use of patches for data augmentation, and the proper alignment of mp-MRI sequences and prostatectomy specimens for machine learning. The result of the work of this aim will be the creation of an algorithm for gen- erating imaging biomarkers (features) and cancer probability maps from mp-MRI data. In Aim 2, a multimodal learning framework that will integrate mp-MRI sequence data with clinical parameters in order to predict the presence of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma will be developed. The innovation in this aim will be the devel- opment of a framework that can integrate information from multiple modalities (imaging, serum, history, etc.) in order to generate a high confidence prediction of the presence of aggressive prostate cancer without the use of invasive testing. Long-term Objective: The development of a novel predictive model for the presence of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma in prostate mp-MRI data that will enable better future use of this data for the early detection of prostate cancer. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most common newly diagnosed cancer and second deadliest cancer in American men.

"Enhancing low count PET and SPECT imaging with deep learning methods Abstract (Parent) Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with preferential delivery of 90Y microspheres to target lesions has shown promising response rates with limited toxicity in the treatment of hepatocellular (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. However, to achieve more durable responses, there is much room to improve/adapt the treatment to ensure that all lesions and lesion sub-regions receive adequate radiation delivery. While externally delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well suited for smaller solitary HCC, its application for larger or multifocal disease is challenged by the radiation tolerance of the normal liver parenchyma. A dosimetry guided combined approach that exploits complementary advantages of internal and external radiation delivery can be expected to improve treatment of HCC. To make this transition, however, prospective clinical trials establishing safety are needed. Furthermore, for routine clinic use, accurate and fast voxel-level dose estimation in internal radionuclide therapy, that lags behind external beam therapy dosimetry, is still needed. Our long-term goal is to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy with personalized dosimetry guided treatment. Our objective in this application is to demonstrate that it is possible to use 90Y imaging based absorbed dose estimates after SIRT to safely deliver external radiation to target regions (voxels) that are predicted to be underdosed and to develop deep learning based tools to make voxel-level internal dose estimation practical for routine clinic use. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a Phase 1 clinical trial in HCC patients where we will take the novel approach of using the 90Y PET/CT derived absorbed dose map after SIRT to deliver SBRT to tumor regions predicted to be underdosed based on previously established dose-response models. The primary objective of the trial is to obtain estimates of safety of combined SIRT+SBRT for future Phase II trial design. In parallel, in Aim 2, building on promising initial results we will develop novel deep learning based tools for 90Y PET/CT and SPECT/CT reconstruction, joint reconstruction-segmentation and scatter estimation under the low count-rate setting, typical for 90Y. These methods have a physics/mathematics foundation, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are included within the iterative reconstruction process, instead of post-reconstruction denoising. In Aim 3, we will develop a CNN for fast voxel-level dosimetry and combine with the CNNs of Aim 2 to develop an innovative end-to-end framework with unified dosimetry-task based training. At the end of this study, we will be ready to use the new deep learning tools in a Phase II trial to demonstrate enhanced efficacy with SIRT+SBRT compared with SIRT alone and advance towards our long- term goal. This will accelerate adoption of these next-generation tools in clinical practice and will have a significant positive impact because treatment based on patient specific dosimetry will substantially improve efficacy, compared with current standard practice in SIRT. Although we focus on 90Y SIRT, our tools will be applicable in radionuclide therapy in general, a rapidly advancing treatment option. Narrative We will perform a Phase I clinical trial where standard-of-care Y-90 microsphere radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma will be followed by external radiation to target regions that are predicted to be underdosed by Y-90, based on patient specific dosimetry. In parallel, we will develop and test voxel-level internal dosimetry tools using convolution neural networks to make such dosimetry-based planning accurate and fast for routine clinic use.

"SPECT with a Compton Camera for Thyroid Cancer Imaging SPECT with a Compton Camera for Thyroid Cancer Imaging ABSTRACT The thyroid gland is butterfly-shaped in the lower front of the neck, and secretes hormones for normal biological functions. The incidence of thyroid nodules increases with age, involving more than half of the population. Thyroid cancer is the most common type of endocrine-related cancer and the most common cancer in young women, with over 50K new cases per year in the United States. To detect and treat thyroid cancer, it is desired to characterize the nodule accurately. Currently, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography (CT) are used with radioiodine scintigraphy to evaluate patients with thyroid cancer. The gamma camera for SPECT contains a mechanical collimator that greatly compromises dose efficiency and limits diagnostic sensitivity. Fortunately, the Compton camera is emerging as an ideal approach for mapping the distribution of radiopharmaceuticals inside the thyroid. It is because the Compton camera requires no mechanical collimation and in principle rejects no gamma ray photon. Hence, radiation dose will be reduced by orders of magnitude in screening and follow-up scans of patients. In this R21 project, we will design a high-efficiency and high-quality tomographic imaging system with a Compton camera dedicated to thyroid cancer imaging, and develop an associated software package for Compton scattering based SPECT imaging. The major innovation lies in the deep learning empowered image reconstruction and the Timepix3-based Compton camera for thyroid cancer imaging. The proposed techniques help reduce radiation dose dramatically, improve the imaging speed, and enhance image quality and diagnostic performance, having a great potential for clinical translation. The three specific aims are defined as follows: (1) a Monte Carlo simulator will be developed for gamma ray Compton data synthesis; (b) deep reconstruction algorithms will be developed for Compton camera based SPECT, and (c) a SPECT system will be designed in numerical simulation and phantom experiments for ultra-low-dose thyroid imaging. Upon the completion of this project, the simulation and reconstruction software tools should have been developed for tomographic imaging of the radiotracer distribution in the human thyroid, and a point of care (POC) SPECT system will have been designed with the Compton camera and experimentally verified for a superior diagnostic performance at an ultra-low dose. The synergy among the deep learning techniques and the cutting-edge Timepix3 camera will have been demonstrated for a follow-up R01 proposal. NARRATIVE A high-efficiency and high-quality Compton camera based SPECT imaging system will be designed for thyroid cancer imaging. This will benefit not only new thyroid cancer patients (>50K per year in USA alone) who need diagnosis and treatment but also thyroid cancer survivors (>800K in USA alone) who need long-life following-up to monitor and combat any recurrence of cancer.",SPECT with a Compton Camera for Thyroid Cancer Imaging,10286795,R21CA264772,"['reconstruction ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' prototype ', ' combat ', ' system architecture ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' imaging system ', ' Compton radiation ', ' Compton scattering ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' Prognosis ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Butterflies ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of thyroid ', ' Malignant Thyroid Gland Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid Cancer ', ' Conceptions ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gamma Cameras ', ' Nuclear Cameras ', ' Scinti-Cameras ', ' Scintillation Cameras ', ' γ Cameras ', ' Gamma Rays ', ' Gamma Radiation ', ' γ-Radiation ', ' γ-Ray ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Incidence ', ' Iodine Isotopes ', ' Learning ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Neck ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Radioisotopes ', ' Radioactive Isotopes ', ' Radionuclides ', ' Radionuclide Imaging ', ' Gamma Camera Imaging ', ' Radioisotope Scanning ', ' Scintigraphy ', ' radionuclide imaging/scanning ', ' radionuclide scanning ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Thyroid Gland ', ' Thyroid ', ' Thyroid Head and Neck ', ' Thyroid Nodule ', ' Thyroid Gland Nodule ', ' tomography ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Photons ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' detector ', ' Label ', ' Radiopharmaceuticals ', ' Radiopharmaceutical Compound ', ' radioactive drugs ', ' radiotherapeutic drugs ', ' improved ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Papillary ', ' uptake ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' 131 Iodine ', ' I-131 ', ' Iodine I 131 ', ' I131 isotope ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Life ', ' Visible Human Project ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Collimation ', ' Collimator ', ' Endocrine ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' empowered ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' synergism ', ' attenuation ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' Radiation ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Distant Cancer ', ' Distant Metastasis ', ' radioiodine ', ' Radioactive Iodine ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' survive cancer ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R21,2021,407750

"Deep LOGISMOS Abstract: This is a competitive continuation of a project that already yielded the highly flexible, accurate, and broadly applicable LOGISMOS framework for context-aware n-dimensional image segmentation. To substantially improve and extend its capability, we will develop Deep LOGISMOS that combines and reinforces the complementary advantages of LOGISMOS and deep learning (DL). There is growing need for quantitative failure-free 3D and higher-D image analysis for diagnostic and/or planning purposes. Examples of current use exist in radiation oncology, cardiology, ophthalmology and other areas of routine clinical medicine, many of which however still rely on manual slice-by-slice tracing. This manual nature of such analyses hinders their use in precision medicine. Deep LOGISMOS research proposed here will solve this problem and will offer routine efficient analysis of clinical images of analyzable quality. To stimulate a new phase of this research project, we hypothesize that: Advanced graph-based image segmentation algorithms, when combined with deep-learning-derived application/modality specific parameters and allowing highly efficient expert-analyst guidance working in concert with the segmentation algorithms, will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinely acquired, complex, diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas. The proposed research focuses on establishing an image segmentation and analysis framework combining the strengths of LOGISMOS and DL, developing a new way to efficiently generate training data necessary for learning from examples, forming a failure-free strategy for 3D, 4D, and generally n-D quantitative medical image analysis, and discovering ways for automated segmentation quality control. We will fulfill these specific aims:  1. Develop an efficient approach for building large segmentation training datasets in 3D, 4D, n-D  using assisted and suggestive annotations.  2. Develop Deep LOGISMOS, combining two well-established algorithmic strategies – deep learning  and LOGISMOS graph search.  3. Develop and validate methods employing deep learning for quality control of Deep LOGISMOS.  4. In healthcare-relevant applications, demonstrate that Deep LOGISMOS improves segmentation  performance in comparison with state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Deep LOGISMOS will bring broadly available routine quantification of clinical images, positively impacting the role of reliable image-based information in tomorrow’s precision medicine. Narrative: Previous phases of this successful research project were devoted to the development of new graph-based methods for multi-surface and/or multi-object multi-dimensional biomedical image segmentation. Deep learning is emerging as an important new way to learn from large sets of examples. This proposal will combine deep learning and graph-based image analysis to maximize their combined strengths and overcome their individual weaknesses with the overarching goal to facilitate routine use of quantitative medical image analysis techniques in personalized medical care.",Deep LOGISMOS,10188526,R01EB004640,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Automation ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Suggestion ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Fundus photography ', ' eye fundus photography ', ' fundus camera ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' macular edema ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Graph ', ' Modality ', ' response ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' Data ', ' Slice ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' PET/CT scan ', ' PET/CT ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' Computational Science ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' n-dimensional ', ' task analysis ', ' clinical care ', ' FDA approved ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' clinical imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' automated analysis ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,388359
"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,10158473,R21EB029179,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computers ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Industry ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Polycystic Kidney Diseases ', ' Polycystic Kidney ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Modernization ', ' mortality ', ' Noise ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Physics ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Research ', ' Rotation ', ' Starvation ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Photons ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Measurement ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' urolithiasis ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' BMI ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Dose ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' data integration ', ' data acquisition ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical practice ', ' data sharing ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' targeted imaging ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' clinically translatable ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep learning ', ' side effect ', ' low dose computed tomography ', ' low dose computerized tomography ', ' low-dose CT ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2021,227282
"Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI Sensitive imaging biomarkers are urgently needed for screening of high‐risk subjects, determine early disease progression, and assess response to therapies in neurodegenerative disorders. The atrophy of several brain regions is an established biomarker in AD, which strongly correlates with AD neuropathology. The accuracy of subfield volumes and cortical thickness estimated from current MRI methods is limited because of the vulnerability to motion, low spatial resolution, low contrast between brain sub‐structures, and dependence of current segmentation frameworks on image quality. Short motion‐compensated MRI protocols to map the human brain at high spatial resolution with multiple contrasts, along with accurate and computationally efficient segmentation algorithms, are urgently needed tor early detection and management of subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. We propose to introduce a 15‐minute motion‐robust 3‐D acquisition and reconstruction scheme to recover whole‐brain MRI data with 0.2 mm isotropic resolution with several different inversion times on 7T, along with segmentation algorithms that are robust to acceleration. The key difference of this framework from current approaches, which rely on MRI data 1 mm resolution, is the quite significant increase in spatial resolution to 0.2 mm as well as the availability of multiple conteasts. This improvement is enabled by innovations in all areas of the data‐processing pipeline, including acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. These innovations are facilitated and integrated by the model based deep learning framework (MoDL); this framework facilitates the joint exploitation the available prior information, including motion and models for magnetization evolution, with convolutional neural network blocks that learn anatomical information from exemplar data. The successful completion of this framework will yield sensitive biomarkers, which will be considerably less expensive than PET and does not involve radiation exposure. As 7T clinical scanners become more common, this framework can emerge as a screening tool for high‐risk subjects (e.g. APOE, PSEN mutations) and assess progression in patients with short follow‐up duration. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is now a major public health concern with life expectancy at an all-time high. In US alone, the number of affected patients is expected to triple to 13.8 million by the year 2050. This proposal focuses on the development of an ultra-high resolution multicontrast MRI protocol, with the objective of improving the accuracy of brain atrophy rates in early AD subjects. The successful completion of this proposal will yield a biomarker that is sensitive to early brain changes in AD, which can facilitate early detection in high risk population, measure progression, and quantify the efficacy of brain sparing drugs.",Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI,10120861,R01AG067078,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', '

"Automatic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers ABSTRACT As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention, which is critical in reducing long term toxicity of cancers. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to organs-at-risk (OARs), OARs need to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans during radiation treatment planning to get an accurate dose distribution. Despite tremendous effort in developing semi- or fully-automatic segmentation solutions, current automated segmentation software, mostly using the atlas-based methods, has not yet reached the level of accuracy and robustness required for clinical usage. Therefore, in current practice, significant manual efforts are still required in the OAR segmentation process. Manual contouring suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability, as well as institutional variability where different sites adopt distinct contouring atlases and labeling criteria, thus leading to inaccuracy and variability in OAR segmentation. When OARs are very close to the treatment target, segmentation errors as small as a few millimeters can have a statistically significant impact on dosimetry distribution and outcome. In addition, it is also costly and time consuming as it can take 1-2 hours of a clinicians’ time to segment major thoracic organs due to the large number of axial slices required. In summary, an accurate and fast process for segmenting OARs in treatment planning using CT scans is needed for improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of radiation therapy of cancers. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning methods has revolutionized many computer-vision areas and the adoption of deep learning in medical applications has shown great success. Based on a deep-learning-based algorithm we developed that achieved better-than-human performance and ranked 1st in 2017 American Association of Physicist in Medicine Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge, an automatic OAR segmentation product will be developed in this project with the three aims: 1) further improve the performance and robustness of OAR segmentation algorithms, focusing on addressing the heterogeneity issue of different clinical environments; 2) further enrich the functionalities and enhance usability of the cloud- based software product; and 3) perform clinical validation study on the algorithm performance and software usability at collaborating sites. With this product, the segmentation accuracy can be improved, leading to more robust treatment plans in protecting normal organs and improved long term patient outcome. The time and cost of radiation treatment planning can be greatly reduced, contributing to a more affordable cancer treatment and reduced healthcare burden. NARRATIVE As early detection and better treatment have increased cancer patient survival rates, the importance of protecting normal organs during radiation treatment is drawing more attention. To avoid excessively high radiation doses to such organs-at-risk (OARs), they are required to be correctly segmented from simulation computed tomography (CT) scans. A deep-learning-based automatic OAR segmentation product developed in this project can improve the segmentation accuracy and reduce the time and cost of radiation treatment planning as compared with the current manual process, leading to improved long term patient outcome and reduced cancer treatment cost.",Automatic Organ Segmentation Tool for Radiation Treatment Planning of Cancers,10221655,R44CA254844,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atlases ', ' Attention ', ' Body Regions ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Environment ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intraobserver Variability ', ' Intra-Observer Variability ', ' Intra-Observer Variation ', ' Intraobserver Variations ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Body part ', ' satisfaction ', ' tool ', ' Adopted ', ' millimeter ', ' Hour ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' dosimetry ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Modality ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Cancer Radiotherapy ', ' cancer radiation therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Slice ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' cloud based ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' life-long learning ', ' lifelong learning ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ', ' DICOM ', ' algorithm development ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,"CARINA MEDICAL, LLC",R44,2021,934579
"Cardiac CT Deblooming PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 Americans annu- ally2. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive method widely employed for diagnosis of CAD and planning therapeutic interventions. With the current CT technology, calcium blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment. Similarly, stent blooming artifacts lead to overestimation of in-stent restenosis. As a result, many coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans are non-diagnostic and result in patients receiving costly and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) procedures.  Based on extensive feasibility results, the goal of this project is to use deep learning innovations to fundamen- tally eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware. A consortium between GE Re- search, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Weill Cornell Medicine will develop dedicated imaging protocols and machine learning methods to avoid or minimize blooming artifacts and evaluate the clinical impact of the proposed solutions. In Aim 1, the CT scan protocol will be optimized and paired with deep learning reconstruc- tion and post-processing algorithms to generate high-resolution CT images and prevent blooming artifacts. In Aim 2, image-domain and raw-data-domain deep learning processing algorithms will be developed to correct for residual blooming. After successful demonstration of the proposed methods on phantom scans and emulated clinical datasets, in Aim 3 the proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on 100 patients with coronary artery disease, using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.  At the end of the project, we will have demonstrated and publicly disseminated a systematic methodology to essentially remove blooming artifacts in cardiac CT without a costly hardware upgrade. This will be another suc- cess of deep learning, enabling accurate coronary stenosis assessment and eliminating many unnecessary diag- nostic catheterizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment with cardiac CT, leading to un- necessary invasive coronary angiography procedures. The goal of this project is to eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware, but based on optimized scan protocols and deep-learning-based image reconstruction and post-processing techniques.

"Quality and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Computed Tomography Practice Abstract – Fifty percent of radiation exposure to the United States population is from medical imaging, half of which come from over 80 million computed tomography (CT) scans performed every year. This significant use has raised notable concerns regarding utilization costs, inappropriate applications, and the associated radiation risk. A recent Medicare reports hundreds of hospitals across the country have needlessly scanned their patients twice on the same day. Unnecessary repeated scans expose patients to extra radiation while increase expense, decrease reimbursement, and increase liability for the providers. Thus, the legislative and regulatory organizations have encouraged and mandated stricter oversight of medical imaging usage and its associated radiation. Concurrent to the mandate to better manage imaging risk is to ensure its value: One of the quintessential but most understated pillars of current CT practice is CT’s high value in caring for illness and injury across all ages. To ensure this benefit of CT examinations, there needs to be a careful balance between image quality and radiation safety. A poor quality, overly low dose exam is a disservice to the care of the patient while an exam with more radiation dose than necessary can undermine its safety. Therefore, proper CT imaging requires a comprehensive combined quality and dose monitoring program on a patient-by-patient basis to properly understand, manage, and mitigate radiation risk. Unfortunately, currently there is no such software available in the market that can simultaneously monitor CT radiation dose and its corresponding image quality. The objective of this fast-track project is to develop a first Software as a Service (SaaS)-based performance monitoring platform to track radiation dose and image quality concurrently. The platform aims to provide essential data and insight to improve CT performance through considering both patient safety and imaging quality simultaneously. Specifically, the project will develop a product that offers 1) a robust multi-infrastructure workflow to connect and collect clinical CT quality- and dose-relevant data; 2) a suite of patient-specific CT radiation dose and image quality assessment algorithms; 3) an implementation of a task manager to chain and automate dose and image quality calculations towards CT performance assessment; 4) a combined SQL- NoSQL database system for structured and un-structured quality- and dose-relevant data storage; and 5) a web-based dashboard for interactive and easy-to-use data analysis and visualization. The development utilizes machine-learning methodologies to devise robust and scalable techniques for extracting meaningful knowledge from hundreds of thousands of patient images. The system quantifies value for a value-based practice. It serves as an essential tool to minimize variability in quality and dose across a practice, to ensure consistent use of CT technology, and to ensure imaging radiation dose and quality levels match expected values. The system will be beta tested at healthcare facilities paving the way toward effective commercialization. 1 Project Narrative The dose and image quality in the clinical practice of computed tomography (CT) imaging is highly variable due to variability across diverse technical and human factors. More radiation dose yields better quality images, necessitating a balance between the two in a way that is patient-specific and trackable. The project aims to develop a tracking and analytics platform to minimize variability and to assure the balance of quality and dose across clinical practice.",Quality and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Computed Tomography Practice,10253256,R44EB031658,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Equipment ', ' Fluoroscopy ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic Imaging ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' injuries ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Dental ', ' insight ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Nuclear ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' data management ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' Phase Transition ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' interoperability ', ' graphical user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' clinical practice ', ' data exchange ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' computer infrastructure ', ' computational infrastructure ', ' operation ', ' data visualization ', ' imaging system ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' informatics infrastructure ', ' software as a service ', ' dashboard ', ' radiation risk ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' clinical imaging ', ' clinical implementation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Patient imaging ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIBIB,"METIS HEALTH ANALYTICS, LLC",R44,2021,233372
"Measuring cortical plate and subplate thickness in the human fetal brain from magnetic resonance images PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the fetal brain, cortical plate (CP) thickness is thought to be related to the number and size of cells within a column, packing density, intracortical myelin, and synapses, and subplate (SP) thickness associated with the number of thalamic and cortical afferents and the amount of cortico-cortical connections. Estimation of cortical thickness postnatally with MRI has contributed greatly to our understanding of human brain development and cognitive function and disease onset and progression in various brain disorders. However, our knowledge and research of human in utero CP and SP thickness remains limited due to the lack of available techniques that automatically measure regional CP and SP thickness from fetal brain MRI. Compared to child or adult brains, fetal brains are much smaller in size and have different image contrast. Fetal brain MRI shows lower effective resolution and suffers from head motion which causes artifacts. Thus, it is challenging to extract accurate CP and SP regions and define geometrically appropriate thickness between the CP and SP surfaces. This study will develop a fully automatic pipeline to extract regional CP and SP thickness using multi-site fetal MRI datasets. We will develop the method for CP and SP segmentation with the identification of sulcal cerebrospinal fluid regions using deep convolutional neural networks. Based on the accurate segmentation, a deformable model method that is optimized and specialized for fetal brains will be developed to extract the CP and SP surfaces. CP and SP thickness will be measured based on vertex-wise correspondence between all CP and SP surfaces. We will perform reliability and sensitivity tests using different imaging subsets within the same subject and artificial data created by moving the CP and SP boundary. We will then define the growth rate of CP and SP thickness in all cortical regions in typically developing (TD) fetuses from 18 to 37 gestational weeks (GW). We hypothesize that the growth rate of CP and SP thickness, the maximum SP thickness, and/or the maximum growth GW of CP thickness will be variable across different cortical areas in TD fetuses. The growth of CP and SP thickness in fetuses with cerebral abnormalities (polymicrogyria and agenesis of corpus callosum) will be statistically compared to the growth of TD fetuses. Malformations of cortical development and cortico-cortical connections may result in altered growth of CP and SP thickness in fetuses with polymicrogyria and agenesis of corpus callosum. This study will lay the foundation for a novel biomarker that can lead to greater insight into the mechanisms of normal and altered in utero brain development. Our methods developed from the proposed study will be publicly distributed using a web-based neuroimage computation platform, which will enable more clinical applications of fetal CP and SP thickness analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will develop a novel technology to measure cortical plate and subplate thickness in the human fetal brain using in vivo MRI, which in turn will enable us to understand trajectories (temporal dynamics) and inter-subject variabilities of fetal cerebral growth. The technology for fetal cortical and subplate thickness measurement will lay the foundation for clinical applications of fetal brain MRI analysis in many developmental disorders and extend the field of developmental brain imaging research. This study will provide a meaningful biomarker that could lead to greater insight into the mechanisms of normal and altered in utero brain development, allowing assessment of the impact of maternal exposures and informing strategies for future in utero therapies.",Measuring cortical plate and subplate thickness in the human fetal brain from magnetic resonance images,10366327,R01EB031170,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' Corpus Callosum ', ' Corpus Callosums ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Fetus ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Motion ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Myelin ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Research ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Cell Size ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' insight ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Measurement ', ' Maternal Exposure ', ' Microgyria ', ' Polymicrogyria ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal ', ' Perinatal Hypoxia ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Fetal Therapies ', ' fetus therapy ', ' in utero therapy ', ' prenatal therapy ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' axon growth cone guidance ', ' axon guidance ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' in utero ', ' reconstruction ', ' Cortical Malformation ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' novel marker ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' contrast imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' 37 weeks gestation ', ' 37 weeks completed gestation ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' human fetal brain ', ' ']",NIBIB,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,665529
"Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications This research plan will continue our development of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI acquisition and analysis methods for imaging patients with cancer. AcidoCEST MRI with an exogenous contrast agent is an innovative variation of this technique that measures extracellular pH in solid tumors.

"CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Abstract Many studies have established strong relationships between cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), morphological and physiological brain changes, including stroke, and cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer disease and related disorders (ADRD). New physiological and functional MRI (fMRI) methods allow non- invasive measurement of regional cerebral blood flow, vascular reactivity and physiological brain connectivity. These techniques provide the means to evaluate the morphology, pathophysiology, and brain dysfunction related to CEVD and ADRD. The CARDIA Year 25 and Year 30 Brain MRI Substudies were designed to incorporate state-of-the-art MRI technology into the relatively younger population of CARDIA in order to determine MRI correlates of CVD risk factors and detect early CEVD. These studies documented early MRI changes of CEVD with strong correlations to CVD risk factors, particularly hypertension. The CARDIA Year 35 MRI Ancillary Study is intended to extend these earlier studies into the late middle age population of CARDIA. Most biomarkers of CEVD and ADRD are weakly expressed until approximately age 55, when they begin their precipitous rise to the steep slope evident in the 6th and 7th decades of life. Correspondingly, subclinical disease becomes clinically evident, reflected by increasing physiological changes and cognitive deficits. However, confounding the effects of CEVD are age, lifestyle, and co-morbidities, including ADRD. CARDIA, with its lengthy and rich historical data, is well-positioned to dissect the intricacies of CEVD and putative relationship to ADRD in the transition from middle age to seniority, starting at ages with few comorbidities and low medication use. Approximately 1044 participants will be enrolled in the Ancillary Study from the four participating Field Centers. MRI participants will be recruited from previous CARDIA Brain MRI participants and receive brain MRI scans and cognitive testing as defined for Y25 and Y30. Computer analysis of MRI data will be reported quantitatively by anatomic regions-of-interest. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings, 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes, and 3) identify early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level. CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Project Narrative The CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI ancillary proposal will study the long-term associations between cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease risk factors, brain MRI findings, clinical events, and cognitive changes in young and mid adulthood as reflected in the CARDIA population. Early-onset and mid-life clinical events and cognitive changes in conjunction with a third brain MRI study and cognitive testing will allow us to define MRI pattern subtypes better reflecting pathophysiological variants reflective of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

"Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is an enormous clinical problem and worldwide cause of disability. Development of new therapies for OA is hampered by a lack of sensitive imaging tests that respond to changes in disease status. Recently FDA and CE approved clinical knee 7T MRI has the potential to add sensitivity and specificity to advanced MRI biomarkers of OA progression. This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for development of disease-modifying treatments.

"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,10190850,R01CA237269,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Beds ', ' Communication ', ' Conceptions ', ' Consultations ', ' Curiosities ', ' Due Process ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Individuality ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Failure ', ' satisfaction ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Nature ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' preference ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' treatment planning ', ' skills ', ' validation studies ', ' Modality ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Cancer Radiotherapy ', ' cancer radiation therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer-directed therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' head and neck cancer patient ', ' HNC patient ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' population based ', ' treatment strategy ', ' arm ', ' Systems Development ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individual patient ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' deep learning ', ' deep reinforcement learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,490133
"Integrated radiomic and liquid biopsy monitoring in SWOG S1802: A phase 3 therapeutic trial for metastatic prostate cancer Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) afflicts more men in the U.S. than any other malignancy and is the second leading cause of cancer death in this population. Recently, new therapies have improved survival in some men but have offered little benefit to others. Tissue profiling has identified genes and pathways associated with resistance and progression to advanced disease, but little is known about the dynamics of when and how such changes arise during therapy. Such insights can only be gained through minimally invasive monitoring that allows repeated disease profiling over time. Our multidisciplinary team has developed and tested two such minimally invasive monitoring capabilities: The first is multi-parametric liquid biopsy: streamlined analysis of blood samples that simultaneously measures PC-relevant cellular and molecular features from single circulating tumor cells and matched plasma cell-free nucleic acids. The second is radiomic analysis: high-throughput extraction of quantitative metrics to identify PC-relevant phenomic imaging features. By synergizing the strengths of the two methods, our goal is to test the hypothesis that liquid biopsy and radiomic techniques can be applied jointly to monitor metastatic PC noninvasively over time, culminating in new prognostic and predictive tools to guide therapy. To maximize the impact of our findings, liquid biopsy profiling and radiomic analysis will be integrated into Southwest Oncology (SWOG) S1802, a phase 3 prospective therapeutic trial for over 1200 men with newly diagnosed metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) treated with standard systemic therapy alone or in combination with definitive treatment of the primary tumor. Notably, SWOG and the other participating cooperative groups have reviewed and approved this proposal (see Letters of Support), and the requisite blood samples and CT scans already are being collected as part of the active protocol. In this unique setting, we will pursue three Specific Aims. We will: 1. Use multi-parametric liquid biopsies to monitor the evolving cellular and molecular landscape of mCSPC during treatment in S1802; 2. Use radiomic analysis of CT scans to monitor the evolving radiographic landscape of mCSPC during treatment in S1802; and 3. Integrate cellular, molecular, and radiomic data to develop composite disease monitoring models predictive of PFS and OS. Importantly, liquid biopsies and CT images will be matched within patients and analyzed at key inflection points over the course of the trial: at diagnosis, after initiation of systemic therapy, after definitive therapy, and at disease progression. In this way, the proposed work will illuminate when and how PC-relevant phenotypes arise during therapy, and how they relate to clinical outcomes. In particular, we will better understand which components of the liquid biopsy – circulating cells, plasma, or both – most accurately reflect the tumor's evolving molecular profile, which radiomic metrics most closely correlate with these molecular features and can serve as early cost-effective indicators of emerging resistance, and which composite models combining liquid biopsy and radiomic features best predict PFS and OS and can serve as powerful minimally-invasive tools to monitor and adjust therapy. Project Narrative Prostate cancer is the most common and second most lethal malignancy in U.S. men, and better tools are needed to monitor disease and guide therapy. We propose to combine analysis of liquid biopsies (peripheral blood samples) with quantified evaluation of CT scans to monitor disease over time in a phase 3 multi-center clinical trial for men with metastatic prostate cancer. By integrating these modalities and the data we generate from them in a large prospective cohort, we will develop and validate new minimally invasive signatures of disease response and resistance that predict survival and can be used to monitor and optimize treatment in real time.",Integrated radiomic and liquid biopsy monitoring in SWOG S1802: A phase 3 therapeutic trial for metastatic prostate

"Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cardiac CT provides fast non-invasive assessment of CAD with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value – provided that the lumen can be visualized. However, heavily calcified or stented coronary segments are non- assessable, precluding non-invasive diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary plaques in an estimated 2 million U.S. adults. In addition, the spatial resolution of state-of-the-art CT systems is insufficient for robust visualization of features associated with high risk plaques. Further, while CT can quantitatively evaluate the impact of obstructive CAD on myocardial function using dynamic perfusion imaging, this requires relatively high patient radiation doses, which has limited widespread adoption. Considering the high personal and societal cost of CAD, robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam is critically needed. Built by Siemens Healthcare, a first-of-its-kind, whole-body, photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT system was installed in 2014 at the Mayo Clinic. With support from NIH award EB016966, we showed that the increased iodine contrast-to-noise ratio, decreased electronic noise, spectral imaging capabilities, and improved spatial resolution of PCD-CT relative to commercial CT enabled us to accurately measure increased vasa vasorum density in injured swine carotid arterial walls, demonstrating the exceptional potential of PCD-CT in vascular imaging. Because this system lacks cardiac imaging capabilities, our objective is to develop and validate a PCD dual-source (DS) CT system and novel imaging algorithms to accurately assess CAD in humans, especially in patients with heavily calcified, stented, or high-risk plaques, and to identify patients with myocardial perfusion defects. Our premise is that the established benefits of PCD-CT, used with a DS geometry and advanced noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms, can meet these objectives. Our proposal is significant in many ways: the technology developments will benefit all of CT imaging; robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam will obviate the need for additional imaging, reducing the overall time and cost to comprehensively evaluate CAD and its clinical significance. To extend the demonstrated benefits of PCDs to cardiac CT will require numerous physics, engineering, and algorithm innovations, including novel noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms using energy, spatial and temporal domain redundancies, as well as deep learning. These advances will culminate in a large clinical study to demonstrate not merely that the images are “better,” as is so often done, but that PCD-DSCT provides clinically-significant improvements in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected CAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a new type of cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanner that is able to comprehensively assess coronary artery disease in humans. This technology, known as photon-counting- detector dual-source CT, is capable of exceptional spatial and temporal resolution, multi-energy spectral imaging and reduced radiation doses, allowing it to image the coronary artery and myocardium with unparalleled quality. This will enable comprehensive assessment of coronary artery anatomy and myocardial function from a single imaging exam, reducing time to diagnosis and cost, while also improving patient diagnosis and management.",Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management,10150846,R01EB028590,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Award ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Iodine ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Myocardium ', ' cardiac muscle ', ' heart muscle ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Stents ', ' Family suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Suidae ', ' Swine ', ' porcine ', ' suid ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' vasa vasorum ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' calcification ', ' Calcified ', ' density ', ' human subject ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' novel ', ' Radiation ', ' Computed Tomography Scanners ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Defect ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Coronary ', ' Myocardial ', ' Cardiac ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' high risk ', ' routine practice ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' Geometry ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' spectrograph ', ' spectral image ', ' spectral imagery ', ' spectrum image ', ' spectrum imagery ', ' photon-counting detector ', ' photon detection ', ' single photon detector ', ' spectral energy ', ' spectrum energy ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' societal costs ', ' coronary plaque ', ' deep learning ', ' Visualization ', ' algorithm development ', ' porcine model ', ' pig model ', ' piglet model ', ' swine model ', ' ']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,657862
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,10202485,R01AR074492,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arthralgia ', ' Joint Pain ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' bone ', ' Bone Matrix ', ' Canes ', ' Walking Sticks ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee joint ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Osteotomy ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physiology ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Productivity ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Societies ', ' Sodium Fluoride ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Bone remodeling ', ' bone remodelling ', ' Photons ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' soft tissue ', ' disability ', ' Bilateral ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' uptake ', ' Metabolic ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Bone Tissue ', ' knee OA ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Gait Analysis ', ' gait examination ', ' bone metabolism ', ' cartilage metabolism ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' attenuation ', ' F- element ', ' Fluoride Ion ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Tracer ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' mineralization ', ' cost ', ' pharmacokinetic model ', ' efficacy evaluation ', ' efficacy analysis ', ' efficacy assessment ', ' efficacy examination ', ' evaluate efficacy ', ' examine efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' treatment strategy ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' joint loading ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' Bone Spur ', ' osteophyte ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' gait rehabilitation ', ' gait recovery ', ' gait rehab ', ' gait retraining ', ' gait training ', ' mechanical properties ', ' mechanical force ', ' subchondral bone ', ' clinical translation ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' novel imaging technique ', ' deep learning ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' kinetic model ', ' ']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,425647
"A comprehensive deep learning framework for MRI reconstruction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The primary goal of this investigation is to develop and validate a comprehensive, robust deep learning (DL) framework that improves MRI reconstruction beyond the limits of existing technology. The proposed framework uses “plug-and-play” algorithms to combine physics-driven MR acquisition models with state-of-the-art learned image models, which are instantiated by image denoising subroutines. To fully exploit the rich structure of MR images, we propose to use DL-based denoisers that are trained in an application-speciﬁc manner. The proposed framework, termed PnP-DL, offers advantages over other existing DL methods, as well as compressed sensing (CS). Compared to existing DL methods for MRI reconstruction, PnP-DL is more immune to inevitable variations in the forward model, such as changes in the coil sensitivities or undersampling pattern, allowing it to generalize across applications and acquisition settings. Compared to CS, PnP-DL recovers images faster, with higher quality, and with potentially superior diagnostic value. Our preliminary results highlight the potential of PnP-DL to advance MRI technology. In this work, we will fur- ther develop PnP-DL and validate it in these major applications: cardiac cine, 2D brain, and 3D brain imaging. In Aim 1, we will train and optimize convolutional neural network-based application-speciﬁc denoisers for the above-mentioned applications. The denoiser with the best denoising performance will be selected for further investigation. In Aim 2, we will develop and compare different PnP algorithms. The algorithm yielding the best combination of reconstruction accuracy and computational speed will be implemented in Gadgetron for inline processing. In Aim 3, we will compare the performance of PnP-DL to other state-of-the-art methods using retro- spectively undersampled data. This study will demonstrate that, in terms of image quality, PnP-DL is superior to CS and existing DL methods and, despite higher acceleration, is non-inferior to parallel MRI with rate-2 acceler- ation. In Aim 4, we will evaluate the performance of PnP-DL using prospectively undersampled data from adult and pediatric patients. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate that PnP-DL outperforms state- of-the-art methods in terms of image quality while exhibiting a level of robustness and broad applicability that has eluded other DL-based MRI reconstruction methods. The acceleration and image quality improvement afforded by these developments will beneﬁt almost all MRI applications, including pediatric imaging, where reducing sedation is a pressing need, and high-dimensional imaging applications (e.g., whole-heart 4D ﬂow imaging), which are too slow for routine clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many advantages over other imaging methods, but MRI is slow. Addi- tional developments are required to shorten the scan time, improve patient comfort, reduce the use of sedation for imaging children, and improve image quality. In this project, we will develop faster and more accurate methods for MRI. These efforts should lead to signiﬁcant improvements in the diagnosis of different diseases, so that patients may beneﬁt from appropriate treatment.",A comprehensive deep learning framework for MRI reconstruction,10211757,R01EB029957,"['Acceleration ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Headache ', ' Cephalalgia ', ' Cephalgia ', ' Cephalodynia ', ' Cranial Pain ', ' Head Pain ', ' head ache ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Play ', ' Rest ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Pythons ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Recovery ', ' sedation ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' cardiovascular imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' musculoskeletal imaging ', ' musculoskeletal scanning ', ' musculoskeletal visualization ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Imaging technology ', ' prospective ', ' data acquisition ', ' data space ', ' Network-based ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' 4D MRI ', ' 4-D MR imaging ', ' 4-D MRI ', ' 4-D flow MR imaging ', ' 4-D flow MRI ', ' 4-D flow imaging ', ' 4-D flow magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4-D magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4D MR imaging ', ' 4D flow MR imaging ', ' 4D flow MRI ', ' 4D flow imaging ', ' 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4D magnetic resonance imaging ', ' four dimensional MR imaging ', ' four dimensional MRI ', ' four dimensional flow ', ' four dimensional magnetic resonance imaging ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Formulation ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' ']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,613825
"Leveraging artificial intelligence to develop novel tools for studying infant brain development PROJECT SUMMARY. The first 24-months of human life are dynamic, characterized by rapid growth, and increasingly recognized as crucial for establishing cognitive abilities and behaviors that last a lifetime. However, little is known about trajectories of structural and functional brain development during this sensitive period in typically developing infants, and even less is known about how deviations in these trajectories relate to emerging cognition and behavior or predict later developmental outcomes. This is partially due to current technical limitations on quantification of brain structure and function in infants via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – an important, non-invasive approach to the study of developmental neuroscience. Currently there are insufficient methods to analyze infant MRI scans across the first 24 months of life, especially for brain segmentation – the first and critical step for virtually all quantitative analyses across MRI modalities. Without accurate and automated segmentation, infant MRI analysis is prone to systematic errors and is labor-intensive, limiting the rigor and reproducibility of infant MRI research. This limitation curtails and delays the utility of large-scale infant MRI datasets in the foreseeable future. Addressing these research gaps would significantly advance efforts toward early identification of developmental delays and/or disorders. I propose developing AI-based infant neuroimaging analysis tools for studying the early human brain development via two large-scale datasets: the NIH funded Baby Connectome Project and a centralized MRI data repository from Environmental Influence on Child Health Outcomes. In my pilot studies, I have shown the show good-to-excellent agreement with ground-truth labels from two different sources, and superior performance compared to other commonly used segmentation methods. My first aim is to develop an automated and generalizable brain segmentation pipeline with 3D convolutional neural networks – an AI approach. This segmentation tool can accommodate and process infant brain scans spanning each month over the first 2 years of life. The final AI-based pipeline will be rigorously validated internally, and tested externally. We will release the pipeline as a user-friendly, web-based interface for researchers to use in scientific community. In Aim 2, I will delineate the growth trajectories of regional brain morphometrics, major functional networks, and measure their relationships to neuropsychological functions during the first 24months of life via data from BCP. In Aim 3, I will leverage two different approaches (AI and LPCA) to predict the developmental outcomes assessed up to 3 years old. with the first-year longitudinal multimodal MRI scans from BCP. The interdisciplinary training phase of the award, conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Jonathan Posner at Columbia University, includes a comprehensive plan for the acquisition of technical and professional skills that will enable my transition to research independence. The successful completion of this project will yield reliable tools and novel data-driven methods for studying early brain developmental, fill critical knowledge gaps of early development, and advance efforts toward early identification of developmental delays and disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Little is known about the growth trajectories of brain development across the first 24-months of life because of insufficient approaches to analyze infant MRI scans especially brain segmentation. This proposal leverages artificial intelligence and large-scale datasets to address unmet technical challenges in infant brain segmentation, to delineate the growth trajectories of brain structure/function and measure their relationship with neuropsychological functions, and to predict the developmental outcomes.

"Dual Energy CT-enabled Asymptomatic Pulmonary Embolism Detection on Non-contrast CT Project Summary Asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) are often incidentally discovered from contrast computed tomography (CT) scans that do not target PE. It has a mean prevalence of 2.6% among patients and associated with increased mortality rate and recurrence of PE. Currently non-contrast CT are not read by radiologists for PE, because the hyperintensity signal of thrombolysis on NCCT is weak. Hence, around 2.6% of the patients with NCCT can have asymptomatic PE but are not diagnosed at all, which is potentially a large population.  We propose a deep learning-based automatic PE detection algorithm for single-energy NCCT to improve the cost-effectiveness to discover asymptomatic PE from NCCT. The algorithm will be used to identify patients with higher probability of PE and call for human reading or contrast CT scans. A major challenge is training data accumulation due to the relatively low prevalence of asymptomatic PE and hardness of reading NCCT. To overcome this challenge, we propose to utilize dual energy CT (DECT), which is becoming routinely used for PE diagnosis, to generate virtual non-contrast (VNC) images as training images. We propose to use deep learning algorithm for the VNC generation to fill the image quality gap between VNC images and real single-energy NCCT, which ensures that our PE detection algorithm trained on VNC images can be readily applied to real NCCT.  The expected outcome of the project is (1) a deep learning algorithm to generate realistic VNC images from contrast DECT; (2) a deep learning algorithm to screen PE from NCCT with high sensitivity. Project Narrative Asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) is a pulmonary disorder which is usually incidentally found on contrast computed tomography (CT), but patients with non-contrast CT are often overlooked. This project will develop a deep learning-based PE detection algorithm for single-energy, non-contrast CT scans.

"High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy Project Summary: In prostate cancer (PCa), the presence and amount of residual tumor at the surface of the excised prostate is the only prognostic factor that is affected by surgical technique, vs. other factors, which are fixed and non-modifiable. Yet, positive surgical margins (PSM), defined as the presence of tumor cells at the inked surface of the removed specimen, are common, especially in advanced stage cancers, and are a strong independent risk factor for clinical progression and secondary treatment. In addition, elevated post-operative PSA, which is understood to be related to tumor left behind in the patient, is also associated with high risk of progression and secondary treatment. Thus, complete tumor removal is important to achieve to improve  patient outcomes and reduce overtreatment, yet there is a delicate balance between resection radicality and  minimizing damage to the neurovascular bundles to preserve post-operative function. The NeuroSAFE trial demonstrated that real-time detection and correction of PSMs by comprehensive histology of the prostate  circumference results in improved patient outcomes, yet there are no widely adoptable methods to achieve this. In an effort to address this technical gap, we have developed video-rate structured illumination microscopy (VR-SIM) and demonstrated that it enables accurate diagnosis of PCa in the biopsy setting, and that it can  rapidly deliver gigapixel microscopic images of the entire prostate surface for detection of PSMs. VR-SIM delivers the surface area coverage and resolution needed to detect PSMs, yet it is also fast and relatively simple and inexpensive, opening the possibility for widespread adoption. In this project, our interdisciplinary team of  engineers and clinicians with significant prostate expertise will further advance this technology towards clinical translation, by completing critical technology development steps and by prospectively validating it in a large patient series. Specifically, we will increase the mechanical automation speed of the device, and will develop a fully automated system for handling of the removed prostate, to enable gigapixel panoramas of the entire  prostate circumferential surface to be delivered within 10 minutes of removal and with minimal tissue processing and user intervention. We will then leverage our recently developed dual-color fluorescent stain that replicates standard H&E with high specificity, to develop expert-validated clinical image atlases using biopsies and  cadaveric specimens to enhance image interpretation of VR-SIM prostate panoramas. These improvements will be combined to test the system in a prospective 250-patient clinical study, to determine the accuracy of the device for intra-operative detection of PSMs and prediction of post-operative PSA based on measurement of PSM extent. Finally, we will measure and model expert reviewer behavior using a novel web-enabled visual observer tracking method, which could be used in future computer-assisted search algorithms to expedite  intra-operative image review. Successful completion will set the stage for multi-center clinical trials to validate the clinical utility of VR-SIM for real-time detection and correction of PSMs, and improvement of patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Achieving complete tumor removal in prostate cancer is an important goal to achieve because leaving tumor behind in the patient contributes to increased risk of cancer progression and need for additional harmful treatment. Yet, it is difficult to determine in real-time if surgery is successful due to the lack of available technologies for intra-operative guidance. This project will develop a rapid scanner that will automatically scan the entire prostate surface for residual tumor within 10 minutes of removal, providing images which are readily interpreted by trained pathologists and enabling real-time guidance of nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery.",High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy,10172866,R01CA222831,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Atlases ', ' Automation ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cadaver ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Color ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Frozen Sections ', ' Freeze Sectioning ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Ink ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Manuals ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Nerve ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Genitourinary system ', ' Genitourinary ', ' Urogenital ', ' Urogenital System ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Case Series ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' tumor progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' improved ', ' prostate surgery ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Surgical margins ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Progression-Free Survivals ', ' analog ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Adopted ', ' Surface of Human Prostate ', ' Surface of the Prostate ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' residual disease ', ' Residual Tumors ', ' cancer risk ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' authority ', ' cohort ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' visual search ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer surgery ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' intra-operative imaging ', ' intraoperative imaging ', ' surgical imaging ', ' Image-Guided Surgery ', ' tissue processing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' rapid detection ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' prospective ', ' web-enabled ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' computer aided detection ', ' computer assisted detection ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' imaging system ', ' contrast imaging ', ' neurovascular ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' histological image ', ' histologic image ', ' clinical imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' recruit ', ' preservation ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' classification algorithm ', ' diagnostic technologies ', ' ']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2021,397823
"Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The clinical gold standards to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with CAD are based on invasive catheter-based procedures, such as x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) for anatomic assessment or fractional flow reserve (FFR) for physiologic assessment. However, there are costs and risks associated with such invasive procedures. Such concerns are further highlighted by the fact that large studies have shown nearly two-thirds of patients referred for their initial elective invasive XCA were found to have no significant stenoses. Thus, better non-invasive diagnostic tools are needed. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is the only non-invasive imaging modality that provides a comprehensive assessment of CAD in a single examination, including an assessment of myocardial perfusion, cardiac function and viability, as well as angiographic evaluation of stenoses, without requiring ionizing radiation. These properties also allow for repeat testing as may be clinically indicated. However, despite its great potential to serve as the non- invasive gatekeeper for costly invasive procedures, lengthy examination times have prevented CMR from clinical translation. Although several accelerated imaging techniques have been proposed, these still require trade-offs between coverage, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposal, we will develop and validate novel acquisition and reconstruction strategies to enable a highly accelerated high-resolution whole heart CMR exam for comprehensive CAD assessment in under 10 minutes. We will develop fast and low specific absorption rate outer volume suppression modules to reduce the source of aliasing artifacts from the chest and the back. This will enable higher rates for simultaneous multi-slice imaging in perfusion and cine CMR, improving coverage substantially with minimal noise amplification. For coronary MRI and viability imaging, simultaneous multi-slab imaging will be introduced to CMR, facilitating high isotropic resolution acquisitions with fast coverage. These acquisitions will be supplemented with regularized leakage-blocking and patient- specific machine learning reconstructions for further artifact and noise removal. Finally, we will implement and validate the proposed rapid comprehensive CMR exam in a cohort of suspected CAD patients, comparing our approach with conventional clinical CMR for the assessment of function, perfusion, and viability, and with invasive XCA for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform CMR into a leading rapid non-invasive tool for safe and accurate diagnosis of CAD, improving the healthcare of several million patients with chest pain and other CAD symptoms annually.

"Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and throughout the world. In 2017, CLD had an age-adjusted death rate of 10.9/100,000 total population and an estimated lifetime cost of fatty liver disease alone in the U.S. of ~$222 billion. Liver fibrosis (LF) is the most important and only histologic feature known to predict outcomes from CLD. The current standard for assessing LF is biopsy, which is costly, prone to sampling error, and invasive with poor patient acceptance. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for noninvasive, highly accurate and precise diagnostic technologies for detection and quantification of LF. Our overarching objective is to apply Deep Learning (DL) methods using conventional non-elastographic magnetic resonance (MR) images, MR elastography (MRE), and clinical data to accurately detect and measure LF in children and adults with CLD, using biopsy-derived histologic data as the reference standard. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts to accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a DL framework to accurately segment liver and spleen in order to extract radiomic (gray-scale signal intensity distribution, shape and morphology, volumetry, and inter-voxel signal intensity pattern and texture) and deep features (complex abstractions of patterns non-linearly constructed throughout the transformation estimated by data-driven DL training procedures) from conventional multiparametric MRI. These features allow detection of liver and spleen structural abnormalities/tissue aberrations. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an “ensemble” DL model (LFNet) to predict biopsy-derived LF stage and LF percentage using the integration of conventional multimodal MRI radiomic and deep features, MRE data, as well as clinical data. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate a DL model (LSNet) to quantify MRE-derived liver stiffness (LS) using conventional multiparametric MRI radiomic and deep features as well as clinical data. The proposed models will help physicians to more accurately detect and follow CLD by 1) quantifying LS from conventional MR imaging without the need for MRE; and, more importantly, 2) predicting histologic LF stage and LF percentage without the need for biopsy, while avoiding inter- radiologist variability, reducing radiologist workload, and ultimately reducing healthcare costs. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data from various scanners and sites. The techniques we develop are expected to improve medical diagnosis and prognostication in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow physicians and researchers to more accurately diagnose and quantify CLD and LF as well as permit more frequent assessments in a noninvasive, patient-centric manner, thus potentially improving patient outcomes while lowering healthcare costs. The techniques we develop also can be readily extended for the prediction of other important liver-related clinical outcomes, including impending complications such as portal hypertension, time to liver transplant/transplant listing, and mortality risk, among others. Project Narrative  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of illness and death worldwide, and it is a significant healthcare and financial burden. Liver fibrosis (LF) is a measurable feature of CLD that is important to assess the severity of disease, evaluate for progression and therapy response, and predict outcomes. We propose to apply artificial intelligence methods to noninvasive conventional magnetic resonance images and readily- available clinical data for accurate detection and quantification of LF, thus significantly impacting public health by facilitating personalized therapies without the need for liver biopsy, improved outcomes, and lower healthcare costs.",Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning,10096229,R01EB030582,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Bilirubin ', ' Bilirubin IX alpha ', ' Biopsy ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Crowding ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Portal Hypertension ', ' Laboratories ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' liver transplantation ', ' Hepatic Transplantation ', ' Liver Grafting ', ' Liver Transplant ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",10084899,R01EB028146,"['Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Series ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Blood flow ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Fe element ', ' Iron ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' respiratory ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic field ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' time use ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' magnetohydrodynamic ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,616003
"Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease Project Summary: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that has a prevalence of over 800,000 in the US alone. The economic impact is disproportionally high because it affects primarily young individuals. The characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent hospitalizations. There has been a recent shift in clinical practice from a reactive to a proactive CD treatment strategy, recently coined as “treat-to-target”, where patients are treated to achieve not only an initial response-to-therapy, but also longer clinical remissions and improved mucosal healing. However, this approach requires the regular assessment of disease activity using objective markers enabling treatments to be tailored to the individual patient. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new tools to improve diagnostic accuracy, to quantify disease burden, and to monitor treatment efficacy. Our application in response to PAR-19-056, “Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn's disease” is aimed at developing and evaluating noninvasive, contrast and radiation-free quantitative imaging markers for assessing disease activity and for monitoring response to therapy. Currently available non-contrast MR imaging (MRI) sequences such as diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and the calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are attractive but limited in providing robust and reproducible markers. Different imaging protocols or different scanners result in different ADC values. Our primary goal is to develop robust and reliable quantitative DW-MR imaging markers for the non-contrast and non-invasive assessment of CD. The proposed novel MRI acquisition and model fitting techniques will provide measurements of slow and fast diffusion as well as fraction of fast diffusion, as highly accurate, quantitative biomarkers for cell proliferation, density and size, and tissue perfusion—all indices that characterize the extent of disease activity (i.e., inflammation) in the tissue micro-structure of the bowel. To achieve this goal, we will first develop and implement an advanced distortion and motion corrected (DiMoCo) DW-MRI technique and a spatially constrained probabilistic intravoxel incoherent motion (SPIM) model to compute robust and reproducible markers. Next, we will reduce the imaging time with estimated x4 acceleration with an accelerated image acquisition and a new, advanced deep learning-based parameter estimation technique. The proposed imaging techniques and software tools will provide robust quantitative markers, thereby enabling the accurate assessment of CD activity and response to therapy. They will also reduce the need for invasive endoscopy procedures as well as the total number of other tests typically ordered for monitoring disease, effectively reducing both the disease burden and the overall cost of healthcare. Another important goal is to develop and broadly disseminate open source software that will enable the standardized evaluation of other diseases presently evaluated with DW-MRI that would benefit from the advanced diagnostic and assessment capabilities of the proposed DiMoCo SPIM-DW-MRI technique. Project Narrative: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that impacts over 800,000 patients in the US alone, where characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent, costly hospitalizations and symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, general malaise, and fever significantly compromise quality of life. There is a need for new tools aimed at the reliable assessment of disease activity by using objective markers to improve diagnostic accuracy, quantify disease burden, and monitor treatment efficacy, enabling subsequent treatments tailored to the individual patient's disease profile. The primary objective of this project is three-fold: First, to develop and validate a novel, noninvasive, contrast- and radiation-free quantitative MR imaging and image analysis technique, i.e., DiMoCo-SPIM that will generate robust and reproducible imaging markers from DW-MRI that will enable clinicians to more accurately assess bowel inflammation and response to therapy; second, to develop a machine learning technique that reduces the imaging time (x4 acceleration); and third, to make image analysis software developed in this proposal available in multiple clinical domains that presently evaluate various diseases with MRI and would benefit from the improved diagnostic and assessment capabilities of this computationally-driven technique.",Robust quantitative MR imaging

"MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers SUMMARY The importance of biomarkers in clinical practice and regulatory science is difficult to overstate. The ultimate goal for clinical care of the future is to determine the most appropriate therapy for each patient’s unique version of a particular disease. This concept of precision medicine has been identified as a national priority in the USA, leading to a need for biomarkers that can provide objective and reproducible information. In addition, regulatory science for the approval of new qualified drugs and medical technologies has an urgent need for qualified biomarkers to report on the success or failure of these drugs and technologies. Imaging biomarkers, providing in situ “biopsies”, have the potential to provide such specific information and, ultimately, to improve routine clinical care and speed up development of new treatments. The overall goal of this Resource therefore is to develop novel noninvasive MRI candidate biomarkers that can ultimately be used for: (i) personalized assessment of patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring; (ii) monitoring of the development of new medical technologies and drugs, i.e. for better guiding of clinical trials. The significance of our proposed developments lies in providing the fundamental design and initial testing (i.e. not clinical trials itself) of new MRI candidate biomarkers with the potential to provide surrogate quantitative imaging endpoints that are as close as possible to clinical endpoints. As such, this Resource will focus on designing, calibrating and standardizing new magnetic resonance (MR) technologies to provide reliable measures across sessions, scanners, and raters. This technology will then be disseminated for larger scale patient studies to allow clinical validation.  The MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary consortium combining facilities and expertise of the F.M. Kirby Research Center at Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI), the Department of Radiology at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Medicine, the Center for Imaging Science at the JHU Whiting School of Engineering, and the Department of Biostatistics at the JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health. We propose 4 TRD projects, 3 on MR acquisition approaches and one bringing them together with advanced multi-scale data analysis methods that include machine learning. To assure a proper choice of technologies, we will interact closely with a group of clinical and research experts in a push-pull relationship through collaborative projects (CPs) that focus on brain diseases, disorders, and injuries that have a need for new quantitative MR technology to better and noninvasively assess them. These include anemia/ischemia and related white matter hyperintensity lesions (CPs 1,5), aging, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia (CPs 2,7,10), traumatic brain injury (CP4), glymphatic function (CP6), pain (CP8) and addiction (CP9). As an initial testbed for our methods, we also have a group of service projects (SPs) to which we will provide both data acquisition methods and data analysis software. Finally, we will train investigators in their use and disseminate methods nationwide and to MRI manufacturers for even broader application. Narrative The MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary consortium combining facilities and expertise of multiple departments and schools at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and the Johns Hopkins University.

"Generalizable biomedical informatics strategies for predictive modeling of treatment response Identification of patients with poor and favorable treatment response prior to therapy administration is invaluable for improving patient survival and disease management. We propose to build an open-source scalable generalizable method that would assist experimentalists and clinicians on assessing patient's risk of developing therapy resistance and would establish a foundation for our long-term goal to build a platform for patient-centric clinical decision making, personalized therapeutic advice, and disease management.  We propose to develop a generalizable versatile bioinformatics paradigm that will use patient molecular profiles to PREDICT their Therapy Response, PREDICTTR, which combines network analysis, statistical modeling, and ensemble machine learning in a unique innovative way that allows accurate elucidation of complex multi-level relationships that govern treatment response. The objective of our proposed approach is two-fold: (i) uncover molecular markers and valuable candidates for therapeutic intervention, which can potentially be targeted to preclude or overcome resistance; and (ii) predict patient's response to therapy administration, which holds a long-term promise to improve disease outcome and reduce the cost of unnecessary and ineffective treatments.  Motivated by increasing cases of treatment resistance in oncology, we will apply our algorithm to elucidate (i) response to androgen targeting in prostate cancer and (ii) response to standard-of-care chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia. We will disseminate our approach through a web-based decision- making tool, which will be implemented through a Hadoop-oriented solution to (i) broaden its practical impact and (ii) establish clinical utility. Taken together, this multi-task resource is a unique innovative effort of its kind in the therapeutic resistance space with a direct broad impact on personalized therapeutic advice and disease management. Even though we will train our model in prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, our approach can be easily and broadly applicable to other therapies and diseases.  This effort will be led by an Early Stage Investigator, Antonina Mitrofanova (PI) who has extensive training and expertise in biomedical informatics and big data analytics. Her collaborative team includes Dr. Shantenu Jha (Rutgers, co-I) who is an expert in distributed systems and will advise on Hadoop development and validation; Dr. Shridar Ganesan (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide clinical and sequencing patient data and incorporate the utilization of our method into the Rutgers CINJ Molecular Tumor Board; Dr. Isaac Kim (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide additional data for validation in prostate cancer; Dr. Christopher Hourigan (NHLBI , NIH, Significant Collaborator), who will provide data for clinical validation in acute myeloid leukemia and is committed to test our web-based portal; and Dr. Scott Parrott (Rutgers, co-I), who is an expert in statistical analysis and will consult on power calculations and multiple testing corrections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identification of patients with poor and favorable treatment response prior to therapy administration is invaluable for improving patient survival and disease management. This proposal is dedicated to developing novel biomedical informatics paradigm to uncover genomic and transcriptomic mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and predict patients at risk of treatment failure, which will be shared with a wide scientific community through an open-source web-based portal. We utilize resistance to androgen-deprivation and second- generation anti-androgens in prostate cancer and resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia as our training examples, yet our paradigm can be broadly generalizable to study resistance to various therapeutic regimens and across different diseases.",Generalizable biomedical informatics strategies for predictive modeling of treatment response,10259888,R01LM013236,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Androgen Antagonists ', ' Anti-Androgen ', ' Anti-Androgen Agents ', ' Antiandrogen Agents ', ' Antiandrogens ', ' androgen inhibitor ', ' Androgens ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Atlases ', ' Prostate Adenocarcinoma ', ' Prostate Gland Adenocarcinoma ', ' prostatic adenocarcinoma ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Distributed Systems ', ' Engineering ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Enhanced imaging and treatment of aggressive subtypes of prostate cancer Targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with small molecules for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer (PC) has revitalized the field of nuclear medicine. Few targets have its combination of salutary attributes, namely, high concentration in malignant with restricted expression in normal tissues, easy access with recycling to and from the plasma membrane, an enzymatic active site toward which small molecules of high affinity and specificity can be designed, and biological relevance – an inverse relationship with androgen signaling while being directly related to degree of malignancy. The ureas that we initially described for imaging PSMA in 2002 have inspired a wide variety of cancer targeting species from radiotherapeutics to synthetic antibody mimics. Our goal is to use what we have learned from PSMA-targeted detection, imaging and treatment of PC to focus on highly aggressive disease, including that which does not express PSMA. We will deploy this prolific cancer target here by beginning with a project that leverages the considerable clinical data obtained during the last funding period to refine and simplify PSMA-targeted imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) – in a way agnostic to imaging agent employed. Complementing PET we will explore sensitive new PSMA- targeted agents and methods for photoacoustic (PA) imaging, which can characterize primary disease in new ways in an effort to uncover signatures that could separate aggressive from indolent cancer to prevent unnecessary surgery and its attendant morbidity. Because PC is a heterogeneous disease, in the second half of the project we will move from detection and characterization of PSMA-expressing PC to address highly aggressive, PSMA-negative adenocarcinoma and especially neuroendocrine PC (NEPC), a lethal and increasingly prevalent subtype with the proliferation of modern anti-androgen therapies. First, we will use a PSMA reporter gene strategy to track NEPC-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in order to gauge their spatial relationship to tumor, measure their expansion in vivo, and sense their microenvironment, with a view to improving this case of solid tumor CAR T cell therapy. Finally, we will use cancer cell specific promoter (CCSP) technology, which we developed for imaging and treating metastases, to enhance PSMA expression specifically within NEPC tissue so that it may become susceptible to the detection and treatment of its PSMA- expressing adenocarcinoma counterpart. In addition to using existing PSMA-targeted radiotherapy we will show how a new urea-drug conjugate we have developed can kill NEPC once it is re-programmed to express PSMA. To achieve these goals, we take the approach of beginning with a more sophisticated analysis of our clinical PSMA PET data then work toward more laboratory-based imaging and therapeutic studies also designed for translation. The team we have assembled is comprised of clinicians and scientists with a track record of high productivity and impact working together. We present a graded approach – beginning with imaging and ending with therapy – to management of advanced, aggressive prostate cancer (PC) by leveraging what we have learned over the past two decades about the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). We propose machine learning methodology to enhance clinical interpretation of PSMA PET scans for patient management, and development of sensitive, new detection methods using photoacoustic imaging ultimately to avoid unnecessary surgery. We also propose ways to improve immunotherapy for the lethal neuroendocrine subtype of PC and to re-program it to render it more susceptible to emerging PC therapies.",Enhanced imaging and treatment of aggressive subtypes of prostate cancer,10241243,R01CA134675,"['Adenocarcinoma ', ' Malignant Adenoma ', ' Androgens ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Attention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity -

"A 3D multimodal micron-scale human brain atlas bridging single cell data, neuropathology and neuroradiology Digitized reference brains, also referred to as Common Coordinate Frameworks (CCFs), together with superposed atlas annotations, are of central importance to neuroscience. They bear the same relation to neuroscience as do reference genomes and genome annotations to cellular and molecular biology. Strikingly, however, such reference brains for humans lag far behind the corresponding CCFs for non-human model organisms such as the laboratory mouse. Existing data sets either have sections spaced relatively far apart or lack in-plane resolution down to the micron scale. Crucially, existing data sets are not well connected to the major areas in medicine that deal with the human brain, namely neuroradiology and neuropathology. We will meet this need by creating an unprecedented micron-scale, 3D atlas that combines multiple MRI modalities as well as continuous serial section histology. In particular, the reference atlas will consist of Nissl, Myelin and H&E stains, with 20 micron contiguous serial sections, and approximately ~8000 sections/brain. We will do so using the tape-transfer method, which preserves tissue geometry even in the presence of disconnected pieces to the brain being sectioned, and permits 3D reassembly of the sections into a 3D volume. We will utilize diffeomorphic mapping methods to co-register the MRI and histological data, and will create a human brain CCF in which single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data can be pinned in order to create a Human Brain Cell atlas. We will use machine learning approaches to segment cells and processes in these images and to algorithmically detect cytoarchitectonic boundaries; such machine learning methods will also be used to predict histology and cytoarchitecture from MRI data, with our collected data as a training set. We will make our data freely available to scientists as well as medical professionals through an online data portal with a multi-resolution viewer for zooming and panning through terapixel image data, and also deposit the data in a shared data repository to make it easily accessible to other researchers. We will connect our data to a unique on-line neuropathology resource containing over a petabyte of neuropathological images, including H&E stained sections from the coronal plane. We expect that the reference brain data we produce will become the de- facto standard for a high-resolution reference atlas for the human brain. This project will contribute an important reference atlas that is missing from neuroscience: a multimodal, micron-scale 3D atlas of the human brain that links single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data sets to the clinically significant fields of neuroradiology and neuropathology. The reference brain data set consists of microstructural MRI measurements coupled with serial- section 3D histology with Nissl, Myelin and H&E stains in whole adult human brains. The project will yield quantitatively and qualitatively more information than the best such histological series available today; it will cross-link to major existing atlases; and it will provide a large database for training machine learning algorithms to predict histology from advanced MRI measurements.","A 3D multimodal micron-scale human brain atlas bridging single cell data, neuropathology and neuroradiology",10370064,RF1MH128875,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Archives ', ' Atlases ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Callithrix ', ' Hapale ', ' Marmosets ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Future ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Laboratory mice ', ' Monkeys ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Myelin ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue repository ', ' Tissue Preservation ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Wit ', ' Generations ', ' Cryoultramicrotomy ', ' Cryosectioning ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' Microscope ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' brain tissue ', ' brain cell ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' success ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Modality ', ' neuropathology ', ' Institution ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Molecular and Cellular Biology ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' epigenomics ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' Coupled ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' image archival system ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' image repository ', ' imaging repository ', ' picture archive ', ' water diffusion ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' data portal ', ' data sharing portal ', ' data sharing ', ' genome annotation ', ' Geometry ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' transcriptome ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' reference genome ', ' reference assembly ', ' histological image ', ' histologic image ', ' petabyte ', ' annotation  system ', ' annotation framework ', ' annotation tool ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' data centers ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' data repository ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' Data Store ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,RF1,2021,5278129
"Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors Project Summary The overall goal of this project is to develop a new diagnostic tool, called Cyst-X, for accurate detection and characterization of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts and improve patient outcome through precise decisions (surgical resection or surveillance). Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal cancer among all cancers due to its poor prognosis and lack of early detection methods. Unlike other common cancers where precursor lesions are well known (colon polyps-colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors (cysts) are poorly understood. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages may decrease mortality and morbidity rates of this lethal disease. One major approach for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages is to target pancreatic precancerous pancreatic neoplasms (cysts) before they turn into invasive cancer. Once cysts are detected with radiology imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they should be characterized with respect to their malignant potential. Low-risk cysts remain harmless; hence, patients should remain under surveillance program. On the other hand, high-risk cysts can progress into an aggressive cancer, therefore, patients should undergo surgical resection if possible. Despite this, international guidelines for risk stratification of pancreatic cysts are woefully deficient (55-76% accuracy for determining characteristics of low-risk vs high risk cystic tumors, while only 40-50% accuracy detecting cysts with MRI). Combined, these critical barriers indicate that there is an urgent need for improving characterization of pancreatic cystic tumors. Based on our preliminary results, which support the development of an image-based diagnostic decision tool, we hypothesize that our proposed Cyst-X will produce higher diagnostic accuracy for characterizing pancreatic cysts and provide better patient management compared to the current guidelines. Towards this overarching hypothesis, we will first use powerful deep learning methods (specifically deep capsule networks) for automatically detecting and segmenting the pancreas and pancreatic cysts from multi-sequence MRI scans (Aim 1). Next, we will create an interpretable image-based diagnosis model for characterizing pancreatic cysts (Aim 2). Accurate characterization is necessary for such a diagnostic model; however, emphasis will also be placed on interpretability of the machine generated diagnostic model. Visual explanation of the discriminative features will help radiologists obtain higher decision rates in patient management. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed Cyst-X framework in a multi-center study. A total of 1200 multi-sequence MRI scans will be collected from three participating clinical centers (Mayo Clinic, Columbia University Medical Center, Erasmus Medical Center). Comprehensive evaluations will be made to test the validity and generalizability of Cyst-X. All evaluations will be made with respect to the international guidelines and biopsy proven ground truths. Our proposed study has wide implications: specifically, in the long term, it will influence early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and clinical decision making to improve survival rates of pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Unlike other common cancers for which early detection and surgical resection have reduced cancer deaths (e.g. colon polyps for colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors, such as commonly observed pancreatic cysts, are poorly understood. Towards the long-term goal of early detection of pancreatic cancer, our objective in this proposal is to accurately detect and characterize pancreatic cysts before they turn into aggressive cancer. The outcome of this research will be a new diagnostic tool, named Cyst-X, which will establish a better clinical strategy than the current guidelines by recommending a more selective use of invasive testing, surgery, and surveillance.",Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors,10391173,R01CA246704,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' capsule ', ' Capsules ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Colonic Polyps ', ' colon polyp ', ' Mucinous Cystadenoma ', ' Mucinous Adenoma ', ' Mucinous Cystoma ', ' Pseudomucinous Cystadenoma ', ' Cyst ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelial cyst ', ' Epidermal Cyst ', ' Epidermal Inclusion Cyst ', ' Epidermoid Cyst ', ' Horn Cyst ', ' Inclusion Cyst ', ' Keratin Cyst ', ' Keratinizing Cyst ', ' Keratinous Cyst ', ' Pilar Cyst ', ' Sebaceous Cyst ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk Rescuing Missed Longitudinal MRI visits in the UNC Early Brain Development Studies Database PROJECT ABSTRACT  In our ongoing R01 (MH123747-01A1) “The Development of Individual Differences in Adolescent Brain Structure and Risk”) project, we aim to characterize the portion of individual differences in brain structure in the early adolescent brain is already present in the earlier years of life. Early adolescence and puberty is a major period of postnatal brain development, characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain maturation and reorganization, and emerging risk for psychiatric disorders, though it is not known how this period of development contributes to individual differences in brain structure and risk. The UNC Early Brain Development Study (EBDS) is a unique and innovative longitudinal study that has followed children, enrolled prenatally, with imaging and cognitive/behavioral assessments at birth, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years. 482 children from this cohort are now reaching adolescence, and we are following these children at 12, 14, and 16 years of age via MRI, cognitive and behavioral assessments, with a focus on the phenotypes of executive function, attention, and anxiety, consistent with RDoC constructs important for psychiatric disorder risk. One particular aim is to investigate the use of machine learning (ML) for the predictive analysis of early brain development to cognitive and behavioral outcomes in adolescence and to risk for subsequent psychiatric disorders. Yet, most machine learning (ML) algorithms applied to longitudinal data do not perform well (or at all) when data points are missing, as ML methods need both complete data and large sample sizes. As longitudinal studies suffer commonly from significant missing data at different time points due to acquisition failure as well as participant attrition, even a rich database like the UNC EBDS is reduced to a significantly lower sample size by selecting only complete datasets to apply predictive ML (less than a third of the datasets of EBDS data from age 1 – 10 years is complete).  Here, we propose to rescue missing EBDS timepoints (at ages 1 - 10 yrs) of structural MR image data via multi-modal, multi-timepoints image predictions. This image data imputation includes cross-modality image generation (generating missing MRI data from existing MRI data at the same time), where available, as well as multi-timepoints imputation of longitudinal data (generating missing MRI data from existing MRI data at different time points). We will then apply our out-of-distribution model to provide additional information on the appropriateness of the imputed data. Subsequently, the same image processing that was applied to the original EBDS MRI data will be applied to the imputed/generated MRI data to compute missing information of morphometric measures (regional volumes, cortical thickness, surface area, and white matter fiber tract properties). This imputed data will be a highly significant resource for longitudinal ML/AI studies of brain development performed on the EBDS dataset, as it would allow for an increase in training data of over 200%.

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Super-Resolved MRI in Small Animals SUMMARY Imaging in animal models plays a key role in biomedical research, enabling both foundational studies for understanding disease processes, as well as translational studies evaluating novel therapies. In vivo imaging, in particular, offers the benefits of minimal harm to the animal and opportunities for measuring developmental, longitudinal changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most extensively used in vivo imaging modalities because of its excellent sensitivity to a multitude of biological parameters and flexibility with different animal models, such as rodents, ferrets, and non-human primates. MRI has been used not only to advance understanding of neurodegenerative diseases, but also aging, cancer, addiction, and cardiovascular disorders. However, despite the research community’s desire for emulating clinical trials and performing high-throughput studies, automated analysis of MRI in animal models has significantly lagged state-of-the-art tools that are available in the analysis of human imaging. A major reason is that most animal MRI acquisitions are two- dimensional with high in-plane resolution but thick slices, whereas the most powerful image analysis tools work best on isotropic acquisitions. As a result, many researchers have been resigned to performing analyses involving laborious, manual delineations. Our team has recently developed a novel algorithm that uses deep learning to extract isotropic spatial resolution from a standard anisotropic MRI acquisition possessing without the need for external high-resolution training data, which is typically unavailable and difficult to procure. The ability to retrospectively recover isotropic spatial resolution from these two-dimensional MRI acquisitions allows for significantly reduced costs compared to high- resolution isotropic acquisitions. Moreover, it opens up the possibilities for more advanced analyses by enabling key image processing algorithms, such as registration and segmentation, to be more accurately performed and with greater automation. We therefore propose to perform the following Specific Aims in this R21 application: 1) Optimize and evaluate our deep learning-based unsupervised super-resolution approach for animal MRI; 2) Develop and evaluate a super-resolution algorithm for higher-dimensional data; 3) Publicly release the developed tools. Our overarching hypothesis is that the provided tools will enable significantly more sensitive imaging biomarkers, thereby increasing statistical power and reducing the size and cost of animal studies. The combination of the proposed resolution enhancement with state-of-the-art techniques for image analysis will also increase reproducibility by obviating the need for laborious, and potentially inconsistent manual delineations. Furthermore, these efforts will enable both pre-clinical and clinical trials to be implemented with nearly identical analysis pipelines. This application is being submitted in response to PAR 19-369, “Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research.” NARRATIVE Animal models are critical for developing new therapies and improving the understanding of a wide variety of diseases such as cancer, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer’s disease. Although magnetic resonance imaging enables monitoring of disease progression in animals, computational tools for extracting imaging biomarkers have lagged behind state-of-the-art tools available for clinical data, often because of limitations in spatial resolution. This project will develop and publicly release novel tools for improving the spatial resolution in animal images, leading to more robust, automated image analyses that will improve translation of animal studies to humans.",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Super-Resolved MRI in Small Animals,10303505,R21OD030163,"['Adoption ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Automation ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biomaterials ', ' biological material ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' Ferrets ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Masks ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pathology ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Disease Progression ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' Brain scan ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' human data ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Slice ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' translational study ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' usability ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' animal model development ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cancer addiction ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' 4D MRI ', ' 4-D MR imaging ', ' 4-D MRI ', ' 4-D flow MR imaging ', ' 4-D flow MRI ', ' 4-D flow imaging ', ' 4-D flow magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4-D magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4D MR imaging ', ' 4D flow MR imaging ', ' 4D flow MRI ', ' 4D flow imaging ', ' 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging ', ' 4D magnetic resonance imaging ', ' four dimensional MR imaging ', ' four dimensional MRI ', ' four dimensional flow ', ' four dimensional magnetic resonance imaging ', ' diffusion weighted ', ' animal imaging ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' preclinical trial ', ' pre-clinical trial ', ' human imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' automated image analysis ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",OD,HENRY M.

"Rapid Motion-Robust and Easy-to-Use Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Liver Perfusion Quantification Project Summary The broad objective of this application is to develop a rapid motion-robust and easy-to-use dynamic contrast- enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) framework for liver perfusion quantification and to evaluate its performance in quantitative assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent primary malignancy in the liver. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) using gadolinium-based contrast agents is currently a cornerstone for identifying and characterizing hepatic lesions, including HCC. However, the current clinical use of liver DCE-MRI is limited to visual assessment of the pattern of perfusion in 3-4 multiphasic images (arterial, venous and delayed phases), and these images are routinely acquired during multiple breath holds. DCE-MRI also has the potential for quantitative assessment of perfusion kinetics, which can provide a deeper insight into the tumor microenvironment for non-invasive characterization of different histological features of the tumor, such as tumor angiogenesis and aggressiveness. This is particularly relevant for HCC, which is typically diagnosed based on imaging without pathological confirmation from invasive biopsy. Unfortunately, conventional liver perfusion MRI techniques suffer from a number of important limitations that restrict its clinical implementation, including (1) slow imaging speed, (2) limited spatiotemporal resolution, (3) sensitivity to motion artifacts, and (4) time-consuming quantitative perfusion analysis. Meanwhile, the need for pre-contrast T1 mapping to convert MR signal to gadolinium concentration further complicates the already-cumbersome imaging workflow. These challenges and underlying complexity have all led to non-reproducible performance of liver perfusion MRI and have significantly diminished its ultimate clinical utility. In this project, we propose to develop new rapid MRI techniques combining novel motion-robust sampling strategies and advanced reconstruction models to address these challenges. The new imaging techniques will enable motion-robust 3D T1 mapping with whole-liver coverage for efficient estimation of contrast concentration and free-breathing DCE-MRI of the liver with high spatiotemporal resolution. We will also incorporate state-of-the-art methods in deep learning to further improve imaging performance, to reduce reconstruction time, and to substantially simplify perfusion quantification. These new technical developments will be integrated into a new liver perfusion MRI framework, which will be translated into the clinical setting for assessment of HCC in an exploratory clinical study. The overall hypothesis is that with the new imaging framework developed in the project, robust high spatiotemporal resolution perfusion MRI of the liver can be achieved under free breathing, and absolute quantification of liver perfusion can be performed without user- interaction. Given the rapidly rising incidence and substantial burden of HCC in the United States, successful completion of this project would enable significant progress towards improved characterization and management of HCC and other liver diseases with high clinical impact. Project Narrative The objective of this application is to develop and evaluate a rapid motion-robust and easy-to-use dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) framework for liver perfusion quantification.

"Development and validation of MRI mapping of brain oxygen metabolism for clinical use The objective of this proposed research is to develop a noninvasive, challenge-free, and widely available method for quantitative mapping of cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). As the brain continuously consumes 20% of the total oxygen supply, oxygen deficiency easily causes severe brain tissue damages as in hypoxia in ischemia in stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Regional OEF is an essential, direct biomarker for tissue viability and function and highly desired for evaluating and stratifying treatments in these neurologic disorders. Widely distributed MRI provides the potential to overcome the 15O PET, the current reference standard but clinically not used due to its limited availability. In MRI, quantitative mapping of OEF requires estimating deoxyheme concentration [dH] from the MRI signal. Three major approaches have been proposed to estimate [dH] from MRI magnitude signal. However, they commonly suffer from poor sensitives and burdensome data acquisition schemes as the MRI magnitude signal which they utilize has a complex dependence on [dH]. Consequently, no MRI-based OEF mapping has been routinely used in clinical setting. Furthermore, none of these methods have been validated against the current reference standard, 15O PET.  Recently, we developed a promising, novel, non-invasive MRI-based OEF method that requires no vascular challenge and utilizes a single routine MR sequence. By integrating quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) modeling of often neglected MRI phase signal and quantitative blood oxygenation level dependent (qBOLD) modeling of MRI magnitude signal, our model (QSM+qBOLD=QQ) can distinguish deoxyheme iron in venous vasculature from diffusive other susceptibility sources. In our preliminary data, QQ has been validated against 15O-PET in healthy adults and showed OEF abnormalities in ischemic stroke, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumor. However, for clinical use, data acquisition and processing scheme of QQ should be improved to ensure the accuracy of OEF as a lack of data at short echo time and a non-optimal signal modeling with gradient-based solvers in current setting hinders the accurate OEF estimation.  In this K99/R00 project, we will establish a clinically readily applicable MRI toolset for quantitative OEF mapping, which is validated and available to every MRI scanner, by improving QQ. We will achieve this through 4 specific aims. Aim1. Develop optimal data acquisition for MRI-OEF mapping. Aim 2. Develop data processing algorithms for robust OEF estimation. Aim 3. Perform technical validation of MRI-OEF against 15O PET. Aim 4. Perform clinical validation of MRI-OEF in patients with intracranial stenosis. Our experience and preliminary data give us confidence that we will very likely succeed this this proposed project. In a timely fashion, the project will lead to a novel, validated, non-invasive, challenge-free, routinely usable and quantitative MRI OEF mapping, offering the potential to replace invasive, complicated current standard 15O PET OEF. This tool will lead to better understanding and management of neurovascular disorders, e.g. stroke. The proposed research will develop a non-invasive, challenge-free, widely available imaging method to map cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), a direct biomarker for tissue viability and essential for patient care strategies. Successful development will lead to easily and widely usable tool for quantitative mapping of OEF, which can be routinely used on all 3T MRI scanners to study brain functions and neurologic disorders including stroke.",Development and validation of MRI mapping of brain oxygen metabolism for clinical use,10283579,K99NS123229,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Half-Life ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Ischemia ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Noise ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Fe element ', ' Iron ', ' tool ', ' Venous ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' experience ', ' radioligand ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Institution ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Tissue Viability ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Validation ', ' Tracer ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' blood oxygen level dependent ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neglect ', ' Consumption ', ' data acquisition ', ' clinical practice ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Intracranial Arterial Stenosis ', ' intracranial stenosis ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' Formulation ', ' neurovascular ', ' neuro-vascular ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2021,100560
"Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI Project Summary/Abstract Background: Although current MRI performs well as a tool to measure white matter (WM) inflammation in MS, its ability to quantify gray matter (GM) pathology, meningeal inflammation, and chronic inflammatory changes are limited. For this reason, researchers have looked to 7-tesla (7T) MRI for more robust in vivo measures of pathology. Although the increased sensitivity of 7T MRI for these aspects of MS have stimulated much interest, the impact of previous studies have been limited due to small sample sizes, varying methodologies, cumbersome analysis methods, and conflicting results – all of which have limited the generalizability of findings and more widespread dissemination of the use of this tool. Objective: In this study, we aim to advance the use of 7T MRI as a tool for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment effect monitoring by performing multi-site, large sample size evaluation of imaging correlates of cortical and deep GM lesions, chronic active WM lesions (WM lesions with paramagnetic rims on MRI), and meningeal inflammation (leptomeningeal inflammation (LME) on MRI) and validation of their clinical relevance. We also will look develop automated tools for identification and quantification of these findings on 7T MRI. Study Design: Imaging and clinical data will be derived from previous and ongoing studies of the use of 7T MRI in MS performed at multiple collaborative sites under the umbrella of the North American Imaging in MS (NAIMS) Collaborative, including the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Harvard-Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University. This includes data on up to 814 individual persons with MS, 1232 individual study visits, and a follow up period of up to 5 years. GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME will be identified on 7T, with critical evaluation of methods and their relationship to clinical data. Further, the manual analysis results will be used as training sets for deep learning algorithms for identification of these abnormalities on future 7T MRI scans. Impact: This study would provide the data on measurement variability and generalizable clinical importance of the imaging findings being investigated, along with providing automated tools for future, high-throughput studies. In advancing these precise measures of aspects of MS pathology only poorly measured on lower field MRI, this study will lead to more accurate MS diagnoses, improvements in the ability to monitor changes in MS pathology over time, and perhaps lead to the screening of new pharmaceutical interventions to target GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME. Project Narrative In this study, multiple institutions performing research using 7-tesla (7T) MRI research on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) will combine data for a large scale, pooled analysis project. The investigators will refine methods for visualizing cortical and deep gray matter lesions, chronically inflamed white matter lesions, and meningeal inflammation on 7T MRI in MS and will evaluate their clinical relevance on a large scale and develop machine learning algorithms for future identification. It is expected that validating findings on 7T and their clinical relevance along with providing automated tools for analysis will lead to the use of 7T MRI as a more widespread clinical tool, resulting in earlier diagnoses, better prognostication, and more effective treatment monitoring in MS.",Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI,10278178,R01NS122980,"['Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Baltimore ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Maryland ', ' Masks ', ' Meninges ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Standardization ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' physically handicapped ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' Caring ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Meningeal ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' magnetic field ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Devices ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' Multiple Sclerosis Lesions ', ' MS Lesions ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Consumption ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' treatment effect ', ' comparative ', ' clinical care ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' screening ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' cognitive disability ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' prognostic tool ', ' multiple sclerosis patient ', ' MS patient ', ' patients with MS ', ' patients with multiple sclerosis ', ' imaging study ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Prognosis ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,535821
"Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Project Summary Organ motion is a predominant limiting factor for the maximum exploitation of modern radiation therapy (RT). Adverse influence of the organ motion is aggravated in hypofractionated treatment because of protracted dose delivery. Current image guided RT often relies on the use of implanted fiducial markers (FMs) for online/offline target localization, which is invasive and costly, and introduces possible bleeding, infection and discomfort of the patient. In this project, we harness the enormous potential of deep learning and investigate a novel markerless localization strategy by combined use of a pre-trained deep learning model and kV X-ray projection or cone beam CT images. We hypothesize that incorporation of deep layers of image information allows us to visualize otherwise invisible target in real-time and greatly reduce the uncertainties in beam targeting. Specific aims of the project are to: (1) Develop a DL-based tumor target localization framework for image guided RT (IGRT); (2) Apply the DL-based strategy to localize prostate target on 2D kV X-ray projection and 3D CBCT images; and (3) Evaluate the potential clinical impact of the DL strategy for pancreatic IGRT. This study brings up, for the first time, highly accurate markerless target localization based on deep learning and provides a clinically sensible solution for IGRT of prostate and pancreas cancers or other types of cancers. Successful completion of this investigation will significantly advance the current beam targeting technique and provide radiation oncology discipline a powerful way to safely and reliably escalate the radiation dose for precision RT. Given its significant promise to optimally cater for inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, the study should lead to substantial improvement in patient care and enables us to utilize maximally the technical capability of modern RT such as IMRT and VMAT. Given the dose responsive nature of various cancers and that the proposed method requires no hardware modification, this research should lead to a widespread impact on the management of neoplasmic diseases affected by organ motion.

"Longitudinal Mapping of Human Brain Development in the First Years of Life Longitudinal Mapping of Human Brain Development in the First Years of Life Abstract This proposal requests continued funding support for research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to develop computational tools for quantifying longitudinal structural changes in the human brain. The previous project period has been extremely successful in advancing robust tools for longitudinal brain analysis of the aging brain. In this renewal, we seek to further advance robust computational tools for comprehensive longitudinal characterization of changes in the early developing brain. This is in line with our long-term goal of creating computational tools for longitudinal charting of brain evolution across the entire human lifespan. The tools to be developed in this project will allow uniﬁed and concurrent analysis of longitudinal volumetric data and cortical surfaces, facilitating the mapping of dynamic and spatially heterogeneous structural changes during a critical period of brain development. The tools developed in this project will be tailored to studying the human brain in the ﬁrst few years of life, which undergoes dynamic development in both structure and function. We will utilize the MRI data made available via the Baby Connectome Project (BCP), involving 500 pediatric subjects scanned from birth to ﬁve years of age. The outcome of BCP will inform neuroscientists what normal healthy growth looks like and facilitate discovery of the earliest manifestations of brain disorders. To fully beneﬁt from this unique dataset, dedicated computational tools are needed for accurate processing and analysis of baby MR images, which typically exhibit dynamic heteroge- neous changes across time. However, most computational tools developed to date have been mostly focused on adult subjects and are unreliable when applied to baby MRI. We propose to address this gap with three aims: In Aim 1, we will develop computational tools to allow multifaceted analysis of MRI data, including volumes and white-matter/pial surfaces, to be carried out in common spaces for a more holistic understanding of the early developing brain. Our tools will explicitly consider the rapid changes in MR image appearances that are typical in the ﬁrst year of life. Unlike conventional methods that are designed for either image volumes or cortical surfaces, resulting in inconsistencies and loss of sensitivity to subtle changes, our tools will allow joint volume-surface analysis in consistent longitudinal spaces. Improving registration accuracy by drawing information from both entities is critical for detecting subtle changes in the developing brain, which is signiﬁcantly smaller with a thinner cerebral cortex. In Aim 2, we will generate longitudinal, multimodal, and whole-brain parcellation maps for the early developing brain. Subdivision of the brain into coherent regions is an essential step in the macroscopic mapping of spa- tially heterogeneous changes and in the examination of spatial and topological organization. Our approach will allow the characterization of the evolution of parcellation across time and at the same time maintain temporal consistency and inter-subject correspondences of the parcels. In Aim 3, we will develop techniques that will allow prediction of missing MRI data to increase the usability of incomplete data for improving statistical power. Missing data is a common and inevitable problem in longitudinal studies due to subject dropouts or failed scans, especially in studies involving infants. To address this problem, we will develop deep learning techniques for longitudinal prediction of missing imaging data. Successful completion of this project will empower the neuroscience community with computational tools for more precise charting of the normative early development of the human brain using MRI. As part of this project, we will deliver the ﬁrst set of temporally-dense surface-volumetric atlases that will capture key developmental traits and are therefore critical for quantiﬁcation of possible deviation from normal brain development. Project Narrative Unlike the vast majority of computational tools that are developed for adult brain MRI with good image con- trast, this project will empower neuroscience researchers with robust tools needed to quantify temporal structural changes in the early developing brain, including tools for (i) Uniﬁed longitudinal analysis of volumetric and surface data of infant MRI; (ii) Multimodal parcellation with longitudinal and intersubject consistency; (iii) Deep learning prediction of missing data. The tools developed will be disseminated in the form of a software package complete with documentation and tutorials.

"Diagnosis of indeterminate brain lesions using MRI-based machine learning and polygenic risk models PROJECT SUMMARY In 2017 an MRI was performed at a rate of over one for every 10 US residents. The majority of these were brain MRIs. Indeterminate mass lesions are present on over 1% of brain MRIs in individuals over 45 years old. Misinterpretation of brain MRI can lead to significant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. For example, tumefactive Central Nervous System Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease (CNSIDD) is commonly misdiagnosed as a malignancy, even following pathological review. This results in inappropriate brain biopsies, debulking and radiation. While early tumor resection is associated with favorable outcome in patients with high- grade glioma, observation, biopsy at an alternate site or nonsurgical options are often more appropriate for other indeterminate mass lesions that can encompass low-grade primary brain tumor, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastasis. Thus, to prevent iatrogenic morbidity, there is a critical need for scalable and reproducible methods to distinguish CNSIDD from other brain lesions, and to accurately diagnose brain tumors prior to biopsy. We recently published a polygenic risk model demonstrating that the 25 known glioma germline risk variants can estimate absolute and lifetime glioma risk. The clinical significance of these models is driven by germline variants that are associated with >4-fold increased risk of glioma. We have also shown that the same 25 germline variants can predict glioma molecular subtype. As a complementary approach, we have shown that imaging characteristics differ across glioma, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastases. We have successfully utilized MRI-based machine learning to predict the molecular subtype in high-grade glioma. We hypothesize that both germline genotyping and MRI-based machine learning provide an opportunity to diagnose indeterminate mass lesions as well as predict glioma molecular subtype prior to surgery and thus personalized treatment. The project has the following three aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a MRI-based machine learning model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases of unknown primary. Aim 2: Evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the polygenic glioma risk model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases. Aim 3: Integrate the polygenic glioma subtype model and MRI-based machine learning model to predict adult diffuse glioma molecular subtype and validate the integrated model using a prospective cohort. The proposed project will further enhance the care of patients by determining if an early MRI lesion is actually a glioma. Early definitive surgery in these patients could be curative.

"OpenIGTLink: a network communication interface for closed-loop image-guided interventions Project Summary/Abstract In this cycle of the project, we will extend OpenIGTLink software to enable individualized precision guidance, where patient-specific characteristics are taken into account in the planning and control process for image- guided robotic interventions (IGRI) to achieve a better clinical outcome. In particular, we will focus on improving needle placement accuracy for IGRI of the prostate, as a simple, and yet a representative application of individualized precision guidance. Percutaneous needle placement plays a fundamental role in both the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Nearly one million prostate biopsies are performed annually in the United States, where tissues are sampled from the prostate with a biopsy needle for pathological examination. The confirmed lesions may then be focally treated with brachytherapy or thermal ablation using applicator needles depending on clinical indications and patient preference. For those procedures, accurate needle placement is essential to avoid false-negatives or ensure an optimal dose distribution. The demand for accurate needle placement is growing in recent years, as clinicians are now capable of pinpointing subregions in a heterogeneous tumor thanks to the recent progress in imaging technologies, particularly multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the in vivo accuracies achieved by previous studies have never matched the level of tumor subregion targeting due to needle deviation as a result of physical interaction between the needle and the heterogeneous tissue. To address this issue, we will incorporate needle deviation models in an IGRI system using OpenIGTLink software. Our hypothesis is that the models adapted to individual patients will enable avoidance or compensation of needle deviation, leading to an improved in vivo needle placement accuracy. The project comprises the following four specific aims: (Aim 1) Develop a biomechanical model with image-based semi-automatic model generation; (Aim 2) Develop a data-driven prediction model and hybridize with the biomechanical model; (Aim 3) Extend the IGRI platform for model- based closed-loop control using OpenIGTLink; (Aim 4) Evaluate biomechanical, data-driven, and hybrid models in vivo needle placement. Project Narrative Percutaneous needle placement plays a fundamental role in biopsy and focal ablation of prostate cancer. The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate free open-source software named OpenIGTLink to support advanced image-guided robot-assisted systems, where a robotic system guides a needle into the prostate based on biomechanical, data-driven, and hybrid models that predict the tissue and needle deformation in the patient during insertion.

"Ultra-Fast Knee MRI with Deep Learning ABSTRACT Fast, robust and reliable quantitative knee joint MR imaging would be a significant step forward in studying joint degeneration, injury and osteoarthritis (OA). Automation of compositional and morphological feature extraction of the tissues in the knee it is an essential step for translation to clinical practice of promising quantitative techniques. It would enable the analysis of large patient cohorts and assist the radiologist/clinician in augmenting the value of MRI. Automation of several human tasks has been achieved in the last few years by the usage of Deep Learning techniques. With the availability of large amounts of annotated data and processing power, using the concepts of transforming data to knowledge by the observation of examples, supervised learning can today accomplish challenges never demonstrated before. In addition to image analysis and interpretation, Deep Learning is revolutionizing the acquisition and reconstruction aspects of the pipeline. Models can learn a direct mapping between under sampled k-space and image domain. While Deep Learning application to musculoskeletal imaging showed promising results when applied in a controlled setting, it is well understood that generalization beyond the statistical distribution of the training set is still an unmet challenge. In MRI this translates into poor performances when trained models are tested on different imaging protocols or images acquired on different MRI systems. With this proposal, we aim to leverage on this recent advancement and filling the existing gaps. We aim to study novel integrated models able to simultaneously accelerate MRI acquisition and automate the image processing that can overcome the limitation of single domain application. Fast image acquisition and accurate image post processing are typically considered to be separate problems. However, the neural networks optimization design gives us an opportunity to integrate the two to maximize both acceleration and machine-based image processing and interpretation. We will use both publicly available benchmark dataset (FastMRI) and internally collected dataset to build deep learning models able to accurately reconstruct under sampled MRI acquisitions. We will use a dataset prospectively acquired during the course of this study to validate the clinical applicability of the developed methods. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that the proposed integrated pipeline can be applied in clinical setting for a fast and intelligent knee scan obtaining image quality comparable to standard acquisition and automated processing accuracy comparable with human reproducibility. Additionally, we propose to make our annotated image datasets and trained models a shared resource, a centralized, open evaluation platform for MRI reconstruction and image post processing techniques. NARRATIVE This study aims to use Deep Learning to simultaneously accelerate knee MRI acquisition and automate post processing pipelines including multi tissue segmentation, detection and severity staging of osteoarthritis degenerative changes.

"Constrained Disentanglement (CODE) Network for CT Metal Artifact Reduction in Radiation Therapy  ABSTRACT The World Health Organization reported that cancer is the second leading cause of death globally and is re- sponsible for 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Approximately 50% of all cancer patients receive radiation therapy (RT). Many of them have metal implants, which induce image artifacts in the treatment planning CT images and compromise or preclude treatment in an estimated 15% of all radiation therapy patients. Despite extensive CT metal artifact reduction (MAR) research it remains one of the long-standing challenges in the CT field, without a clinically satisfactory solution. The overall goal of this project is to develop cutting-edge deep learning imaging methods and software solutions for commercial CT scanners to eliminate CT metal artifacts in general and improve RT in particular. We propose a three-pronged approach to systematically tackle this challenge in three specific aims: (1) adversarial learning techniques for estimation of sinogram missing data and metal traces; (2) constrained disentanglement (CODE) networks to remove CT image artifacts during image reconstruction, through post-processing, and in both data and image domains; and (3) systematic evaluation of our proposed CT MAR techniques and clinical translation into robust RT planning methods to maximize the RT treatment planning accuracy and thus improve patient outcomes. Our synergistic track records in CT MAR research, especially with deep imaging methods over the past three years, promises an unprecedented opportunity for a brand-new solution to CT MAR. For the first time we will integrate contemporary AI innovations in data preprocessing, image reconstruction, post-processing, observer studies and treatment planning synergistically in a unified data-driven framework, positioning this project uniquely to eliminate metal artifacts and their complications in radiation therapy. This project will be pursued through the long-term academic-industrial partnership among Dr. Ge Wang at Ren- sselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Dr. Bruno De Man at GE Research Center (GRC), and Dr. Harald Paganetti at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). While our teams will collaborate closely through the whole project, GRC has a history of CT research and translation, including direct raw data processing, and will focus on Aim 1. RPI is a pioneering group in tomographic reconstruction, especially deep-learning-based CT imaging, and will lead Aim 2. The MGH team is at the forefront of radiation therapy research and will be responsible for Aim 3. Upon completion of this project, we will have redefined the state of the art of CT MAR, largely eliminating CT metal artifacts and substantially improving radiation therapy planning and delivery accuracy. With the above-proposed networks for CT MAR, metal artifacts will have been basically eliminated, targeting residual errors <10 HU for photon and proton therapy planning, with the goal of reducing the clinical diametric error to ±3% and the proton range error due to metal artifacts to <2mm.

Despite extensive CT metal artifact reduction (MAR) research, it remains one of the long-standing challenges in the CT field, without a clinically satisfactory solution.

"Bridging diffusion MRI and chemical tracing for validation and inference of fiber architectures Project summary: This project will collect a unique, multi-modal, multi-contrast dataset with tracer injections and diffusion MRI in the same macaque brains. We will use this dataset to develop novel algorithms for inferring local fiber architectures from diffusion MRI. The goal is to overcome the limitations of current methods for diffusion orientation reconstruction, which are designed to resolve fiber crossings but not to distinguish between crossings and other configurations, such as branching, turning, fanning, etc. More broadly, the proposed dataset will allow us to investigate organizational principles of brain pathways and to provide a testbed for the neuroimaging community to evaluate the accuracy of diffusion tractography and microstructural modeling techniques. The project is a collaboration between groups with extensive expertise in diffusion MRI methodological development (MGH Martinos Center) and anatomical tracer studies (University of Rochester). We have previously collected high-resolution ex vivo diffusion MRI data on a set of macaque brains that had also received tracer injections. We have recently used these data in an open tractography challenge, with the participation of research teams from around the world. This was the first challenge of its kind to provide diffusion MRI data suitable for all state-of-the-art diffusion reconstruction methods (e.g., multi-shell or Cartesian grid sampling), in addition to providing the tracer injections in the same brains as the MRI scans. Our own preliminary studies and the challenge itself offer several insights into the performance of state-of-the-art tractography methods. For example, our results indicate that, while most tractography methods would require their parameters to be tuned differently to achieve optimal accuracy for different cortical seed regions, there are approaches that are robust across cortical areas. Furthermore, our results suggest that errors occur frequently in areas where the fiber architecture is not well modeled by a crossing. Thus there is a need for novel tractography approaches that go beyond the crossing-fiber paradigm. Here we propose to develop such an approach. Our prior work included injection sites in the frontal, prefrontal, and cingulate cortices only. Here we propose to investigate the extent to which our prior findings generalize across the brain, by performing tracer injections that sample a wider range of cortical areas. Furthermore, we will extend our acquisition protocol to acquire data appropriate not only for tractography, but also for microstructural and myelin mapping. These data will allow us to answer a broader range of questions about tractography, microstructure, and their intersection. Beyond the methodological development proposed in this project, the data will also be an invaluable resource to the neuroimaging community, providing researchers with a framework for the objective assessment of current diffusion MRI analysis methods and identifying areas for improvement to guide the development of next-generation techniques. Project narrative: This project will study organizational principles of brain pathways with a combination of chemical tracing and diffusion MRI. The ultimate goal is to assess and improve the accuracy of diffusion MRI, which is currently the only technique for imaging these pathways non-invasively and studying their role in the healthy and diseased brain in vivo. The unique dataset collected by this project will provide a testbed that can aid the neuroimaging research community in identifying shortcomings of current diffusion MRI analysis techniques and provide guidance towards seeking alternative approaches that overcome these shortcomings.",Bridging diffusion MRI and chemical tracing for validation and inference of fiber architectures,10099935,R01NS119911,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Monkeys ', ' Myelin ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Error Sources ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Brain scan ', ' Performance ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' synergism ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' brain pathway ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Tracer ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' data acquisition ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' anatomical tracing ', ' anatomical tracer ', ' anatomical tract tracer ', ' histological stains ', ' histologic stains ', ' tractography ', ' Injections ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' automated algorithm ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,666884
"Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry Abstract Photon-counting CT (PCCT) is a major technological advance in CT imaging. Using photon-counting instead of current energy-integrating detectors, PCCT can offer superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, artifact reduction, and most notably, material decomposition. PCCT’s energy differentiation utility offers an ability to more precisely distinguish different materials and optimize and expand the use of contrast agents in CT. With these abilities, PCCT can significantly facilitate quantitative imaging, reduce radiation exposure, and enable revolutionary new applications in functional and physiological imaging beyond existing CT techniques. To realize the full potential of PCCT in clinical practice, the technology needs comprehensive assessments and application-based optimizations. Effective design and deployment of PCCT depends on many design and use choices that should be made in view of the eventual clinical utility. Making these choices requires large scale trials on actual patients. However, such trials are challenging, considering the need to make many decisions prior to prototyping, the limited numbers of prototype PCCT scanners available today, and the often-unknown ground-truth in the patient images. Even for existing prototype systems, many decisions require repetitive trials with multiple acquisitions. This is both unethical and impractical considering radiation safety concerns and costs. These challenges can be overcome by utilizing virtual imaging trials (VITs) using computerized patients and imaging models. VITs provide an efficient means with which to determine the most effective and optimized design and use of imaging technologies with complete control over the study design. In our prior funded project, we developed a VIT framework to evaluate standard energy-integrating detector CT technologies. In this project, we expand the applicability of this framework to photon-counting detector CT. Specifically, we enhance our computational XCAT phantoms to model the necessary higher-resolution detail including normal and abnormal tissue heterogeneities and intra-organ contrast perfusion diversity across populations (Aim 1). To image the phantoms, we develop the first PCCT simulator capable of mimicking existing and emerging prototypes (Aim 2). The enhanced VIT framework will provide the essential foundation with which to comprehensively evaluate and optimize PCCT technologies and applications. In Aim 3, we assess and optimize the use of PCCT for morphological, textural, and compositional quantification in select oncologic and cardiac applications, two leading health detriments in the US where PCCT can offer a notable impact. The results will be the first of their kind in comprehensively evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of PCCT, determining optimum dose per patient size for PCCT imaging of patients for cancerous lesions and cardiac plaque/stenoses, and helping to establish the effective utility of PCCT in clinical care. The purpose of this project is to develop and utilize a virtual framework to comprehensively evaluate and optimize emerging photon-counting devices and applications in CT imaging. The results will be the first of their kind evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of photon-counting CT and will help establish its effectual utility in oncologic and cardiac care.",Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry,10189580,R01EB001838,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Task Performances ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Photons ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Organ ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' soft tissue ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Performance ', ' dosimetry ', ' simulation ', ' Devices ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' virtual imaging ', ' Resolution ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Pathologic ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' computerized ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cost efficient ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Cancerous ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' prototype ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' photon-counting detector ', ' photon detection ', ' single photon detector ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' cardiac plaque ', ' deep learning ', ' Patient imaging ', ' unethical ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,534495
"Prostate Cancer Diagnosis by Multiparametric Ultrasound Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among American males, accounting for 20% of new cancer diagnoses, but PCa is directly responsible for only 9% of cancer related deaths. PSA screening facilitates the detection of PCa, but many of the cancers detected by PSA screening are low to intermediate grade, resulting in overtreatment of non-aggressive PCa. Recent studies suggest an urgent need to selectively identify “clinically significant” PCa that will result in cost-effective treatment of PCa. In the past few years, multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) has become the standard of care for diagnosis of aggressive PCa. Although mp- MRI guided biopsy can selectively detect higher grade PCa lesions, several recent studies acknowledge that a considerable number of clinically important lesions are missed by mp-MRI. Furthermore, given the high cost of MRI, the geographic variability in the availability of MRI systems, the inexact methods used to register and fuse MRI with ultrasound for biopsy, and the dangers of Gadolinium in patients with renal insufficiency, there is a need for a more cost-effective, alternative to detect high-grade PCa. Recent studies have demonstrated that contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can selectively detect patients with “clinically significant” PCa. New methods have been proposed to enhance conventional ultrasound detection of PCa, including subharmonic imaging (SHI), contrast-enhanced ultrasound dispersion imaging (CUDI) and viscoelastography. The objective of this project is to develop a system capable of a multiparametric combination of ultrasound techniques (mp- US) for detection of “clinically significant” PCa. We will compare 3D mp-US and mp-MRI to identify significant PCa (defined as: Gleason score ≥ 7, a single core with > 50% involvement, or > 25% of biopsy cores positive for PCa or as Gleason grade group ≥ 2, PSA > 10 or clinical stage of cT2b or worse). The first year of the study will be dedicated to implementation of our mp-US technique on a commercially available 3D transrectal probe, and to adapting a MRI-based fusion/registration system to mp-US. During the second year, we will optimize mp-US with a machine learning approach, based upon pathologic correlation with 50 radical prostatectomy patients. The final 3 years of the study will be dedicated to a clinical trial with 300 participants suspected of having PCa. Each participant will receive an experimental intervention in the form of biopsy of up to 3 suspicious areas identified by transrectal ultrasound evaluation of the prostate with mp-US. For comparison, a maximum of 3 targeted biopsy cores will also be obtained from each participant, based on mp-MRI (the clinical intervention). Following the targeted biopsy, each participant will also receive a systematic biopsy (standard of care) consisting of 6 laterally directed biopsy cores and 6 medially directed biopsy cores. The study is powered to demonstrate that targeted biopsy based upon mp-US is not inferior to targeted biopsy based upon mp-MRI. Project Narrative This project will develop a novel, cost-effective Intervention, 3D multi-parametric ultrasound imaging (mp-US), for selectively guiding biopsies to detect clinically significant PCa in patients, and demonstrate that 3D mp-US is comparable (i.e., non-inferior) to mp-MRI (the clinical intervention). Thus, at the end of this project our partnership will deliver an accurate, 3D mp-US system ready for clinical deployment. mp-US prostate rev3 narrative DRAFT October 2, 2019 11:56 AM 1",Prostate Cancer Diagnosis by Multiparametric Ultrasound,10199974,R01CA252311,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elasticity ', ' Engineering ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Geography ', ' Industry ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Real-time MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy of unresectable pancreatic cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of only 9%. Surgery still represents the only curative treatment option, though less than 20% of patients are candidates for resection. Approximately 30-40% of patients present with locally advanced unresectable tumors with no significant chance of long-term survival through standard treatments. The use of ablative radiation doses (biologically equivalent doses of 100Gy) produces results that are comparable to surgical resection in patients with inferior prognostic features. However, organ motion, due to respiratory motion, must be managed to minimize toxicity in the gastrointestinal tract. In this project, we will develop novel real-time volumetric MRI technology that can guide radiotherapy to enable the use of ablative doses with minimal risk. Our technique, called MR SIGnature Matching (MRSIGMA), pre-learns 3D motion states and assigns unique motion signatures during an offline learning phase and performs fast signature acquisition and matching during an online matching phase. We have demonstrated real-time tracking of liver tumors with an imaging latency (acquisition plus reconstruction) of about 250 ms using MRSIGMA. We will collaborate with Elekta to implement MRSIGMA on the Unity MR-Linac system and to link the output of MRSIGMA with the multileaf collimator (MLC) system to enable the radiation beam to track the 3D position and shape of the moving tumor in real-time. Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Develop deep learning reconstruction of undersampled dynamic MRI data for rapid motion database  generation during offline learning and adaptation during online matching  a. Develop a convolutional neural network for rapid reconstruction of motion-resolved data (< 10 seconds)  b. Detect anatomical changes, such as motion baseline drifts, and adapt the motion database accordingly  c. Perform initial validation on a dynamic MRI phantom and ten volunteers 2. Validate the potential of MRSIGMA for real-time volumetric tumor motion imaging on fifty patients with locally  advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer  a. Accuracy hypothesis: real-time MRSIGMA is noninferior to a non-real-time XDGRASP reference  b. Reproducibility hypothesis: two MRSIGMA scans present equivalent real-time imaging performance 3. Develop and validate on dynamic phantoms the proposed MRSIGMA-guided MLC tracking in collaboration  with Elekta  a. Develop software to control the MLC with the output of MRSIGMA  b. Evaluate tracking latency, geometric error, reproducibility and dosimetric accuracy PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel real-time 3D MRI technology, using continuous radial sampling, motion-resolved reconstruction, and deep learning, for MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy of unresectable pancreatic cancer. Our new approach for real-time 3D MRI, named MR signature matching (MRSIGMA), pre-learns 3D motion states and corresponding signatures during an offline learning phase and then performs fast signature acquisition and matching to one of the pre-learned 3D motion states to minimize latency and offer a real-time solution.

"Patient-specific, high-sensitivity spectral CT for assessment of pancreatic cancer Abstract. The proposed project concentrates on technology developments to enable high sensitivity, bias-tolerant spectral CT for accurate quantitation of iodine concentration. Spectral CT has the potential of providing true quantitative information of tissue composition and provides an avenue for combined functional and structural imaging. High- sensitivity spectral CT accommodates anatomical sites that are traditionally hard to image, and reliable meas- urements of iodine perfusion allow additional quantitative measures such as tissue texture to aid diagnosis and clinical decision making. In the case of pancreatic cancer, the complex tumor microenvironment and the conse- quential poor perfusion characteristics lead to difficulty in diagnosis, staging, and treatment assessment. The need for visualizing low-enhancing lesions and the benefit of extracting quantitative information directly from image data strongly motivate a high-sensitivity imaging modality for reproducible iodine measurements. The need for visualizing low-enhancing lesions and the benefit of extracting quantitative information directly from image data strongly motivate a high-sensitivity imaging modality for reproducible iodine measurements. How- ever, state-of-the-art spectral CT presents large quantitation bias, i.e., inaccuracies in measured iodine concen- tration compared to the truth. We identify three major sources that contribute to quantitation bias: imaging system (e.g., spectrum mismatch), post-processing (e.g., biased estimator), and patient (scatter, beam hardening). The bias effect in current spectral CT cannot be fully eliminated by increasing radiation exposure, and has complex dependencies on the imaging system, imaging techniques, patient habitus, and processing algorithms. This in- accuracy is a major impediment to pancreatic cancer management and quantitative applications in general. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop robust, high-sensitivity spectral CT solutions that will enhance sensi- tivity and reduce variability in iodine quantitation, which in turn enables accurate, high-performance spectral biomarkers for disease management. The following specific aims will be pursued: (1) to develop an end-to-end, modular theoretical model for robust spectral CT design and optimization, (2) to develop bias-tolerant processing pipeline, and (3) to implement and evaluate high performance, hybrid spectral CT solutions on an experimental CT bench. Completion of the proposed efforts enables robust, high sensitivity spectral CT for improved tumor detection and characterization through accurate, high performance spectral biomarkers. Vendor- and spectral technology-independent outcomes of the proposal include: optimized, patient-specific protocols; post-processing pipelines that are robust against quantitative bias and variability; and the next generation spectral CT system designs for enhanced iodine quantitation. Achievements from the proposed project will improve sensitivity and quantitation accuracy of iodinated contrast media in spectral CT which enables quantitative diagnostics and treatment assessment using robust iodine biomarkers across a broad range of clinical applications. Public Health Relevance. Diagnosis, staging, and treatment assessment of pancreatic cancer is severely challenged by the difficulty to delineate and reproducibly measure pancreatic lesions as a result of low-enhancement from contrast agents. We propose to develop high-sensitivity, low-bias spectral CT technology to enhance low concentration iodine visualization and mitigate system-dependent variability to allow quantitative image biomarkers as additional in- dicators for diagnosis and treatment efficacy. The technology developed in this work can be widely applied to improve quantitative accuracy of spectral CT applications, and facilitate robust clinical translation of novel spec- tral biomarkers for general disease management.","Patient-specific, high-sensitivity spectral CT for assessment of pancreatic cancer",10296757,R01EB030494,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Products ', ' Biologic Products ', ' Biological Agent ', ' biopharmaceutical ', ' biotherapeutic agent ', ' Calibration ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Iodine ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Noise ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physics ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Tweens ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Performance ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' attenuation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' FDG PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' Computed Tomography Scanners ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Contrast-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gadolinium-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gd-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Enhancing Lesion ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Characteristics ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' spectrograph ', ' spectral image ', ' spectral imagery ', ' spectrum image ', ' spectrum imagery ', ' imaging system ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' clinical translation ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' Visualization ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,643028
"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement.

"Integrating Quantitative MRI and Artificial Intelligence to Improve Prostate Cancer Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Prostate cancer (PCa) develops in sixteen percent of males and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. While incidence is high, PCa presents with a wide range of aggressiveness and in many cases does not develop into life-threatening aggressive cancer. Current diagnostic strategies may fail to detect all instances of clinically significant PCa and have limited ability to accurately distinguish clinically significant from indolent PCa due to incomplete and inconsistent information. This not only subjects patients to detrimental co-morbidities including overtreatment and undertreatment, but also exacerbates already significant healthcare costs. Consequently, there is an urgent clinical need to achieve accurate detection and classification of clinically significant PCa and determine the appropriate management strategy. Multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI), consisting of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, has emerged as the preferred imaging technique for non-invasive detection and grading of PCa. However, the current standardized scoring system for mp-MRI, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2, has limited ability to distinguish between indolent and clinically significant PCa, with sensitivity and specificity in the range of 60-85%. This suboptimal accuracy and considerable variation in performance is mainly due to the fact that current PI-RADS scoring is based on qualitative analysis and subjective interpretation of mp-MRI, confounded by scanner- and patient-specific variations, including B1+ inhomogeneity, arterial input function, and susceptibility and eddy current effects. This proposal aims to overcome these critical limitations of current mp-MRI by establishing a new MRI-based artificial intelligence based on two synergistic innovations: 1) new quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI analysis techniques and diffusion-weighted MRI acquisition methods that minimize scanner- and patient-specific variations, and 2) novel multi-class deep learning models that can fully integrate the multi-labeled quantitative mp- MRI information. By leveraging the synergy between existing mp-MRI data and to-be-acquired quantitative mp- MRI data with subsequent mapping of all lesions at whole-mount histopathology, the proposed MRI-based deep learning model will be evaluated for detection and classification of clinically significant PCa, compared with the current standard-of-care, PI-RADS v2. Completion of this project will lead to the creation, clinical deployment, and pivotal validation of a new MRI-based artificial intelligence that achieves unprecedented accuracy for detection and classification of clinically significant PCa, thereby increasing confidence in separating indolent PCa from significant PCa and reducing unnecessary biopsies, undertreatment, and overtreatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current diagnostic strategies can fail to accurately detect and classify clinically significant prostate cancer, leading to detrimental overtreatment and undertreatment. This research project aims to jointly develop and integrate innovative quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms to achieve significantly improved accuracy for detection and classification of clinically significant prostate cancer. The new MRI- based artificial intelligence will be a transformative technology to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies and enhance decision making for patient management to avoid overtreatment and undertreatment of prostate cancer.",Integrating Quantitative MRI and Artificial Intelligence to Improve Prostate Cancer Classification,10115677,R01CA248506,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diffusion ', ' Goals ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' prisma ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Lesion ', ' Indolent ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Life ', ' Scanning ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' synergism ', ' Histopathology ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Ig Variable Region ', ' Immunoglobulin V ', ' Variable Region ', ' Immunoglobulin Variable Region ', ' cancer classification ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Non-Invasive Cancer Detection ', ' Non-Invasive Detection ', ' Noninvasive Cancer Detection ', ' Noninvasive Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' standard of care ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' diffusion weighted ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,544992
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D

"Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning The accuracy of radiation treatment planning (RTP) heavily influences the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of target and OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and automated multi-organ segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will develop an MT-MR simulation based multi-organ auto- segmentation tool. In Aim 3, we will optimize a deep learning-based dose prediction model and assess the effectiveness of the MT-MR based RTP workflow in adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy planning of pancreatic cancer patients. Successful completion of the project will significantly promote the clinical adoption of MR simulation for abdominal RTP, which will improve treatment precision and outcomes. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in both cancer diagnosis and radiotherapy. Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile.

"Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary  In this project, we propose a novel T1 and T2 quantification method that generates quantitative T1 or T2 maps from weighted MR images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used as a tool to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and track lesional changes over time. Because MRI has various contrasts that display different information about the underlying tissue microstructure and physiology, it can potentially be used as a tool to predict MS disease progression and even disability. However, there is no known measure derived from MR images of MS that correlates well with clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS). Previous efforts to correlate MRI features and EDSS have included calculating total lesion load on T1- and T2-weighted images, measuring the variations in the magnetic transfer ration of normal-appearing brain tissues, and calculating cerebral atrophy, each with a varying level of success. Yet, there has been little study of the evolution of relaxation times of the lesions over time and how it relates to disability. Because changes in the T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times of a tissue can reflect pathological changes in that tissue over time, quantitative T1 and T2 maps derived from MR images may be more indicative of microscopic changes that manifest as disability in MS patients.  The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) develop and validate novel T1 and T2 quantification method on spin-echo MR images, (2) extend the novel quantification method to common MS imaging sequences, and (3) apply the novel quantification method to MS datasets to predict EDSS using machine learning. Aim 1 will involve the validation of the quantification pipeline on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo MR images in vivo, resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the novel quantification method. Aim 2 will extend the quantification pipeline to include commonly used and more complicated MS imaging sequences, again resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the quantification method. Aim 3 will use the quantification pipeline to compare machine learning algorithms with and without quantification to determine the added value of quantification in the imaging of MS. Additionally, Aim 3 will result in a predictive machine learning model utilizing multiple imaging contrasts for the prediction of disability in MS. These results will provide a more thorough understanding of the role of MR quantification in the evaluation of neurological diseases, such as MS, and will offer a scientific foundation to extend the use of MR quantification as a potential imaging biomarker for other diseases and pathologies. Project Narrative The proposed research aims to develop and validate a T1 and T2 quantification method using internal reference values derived from T1- or T2-weighted MR images. This method will be applied to weighted images of patients who have been diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis and input into various classification algorithms to determine which method is most predictive of worsening clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score. By doing this, we will determine the impact of this novel quantification method as a tool for both the analysis of patients with Multiple Sclerosis as well as a tool for the normalization of big MR datasets before being input into machine learning algorithms.",Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1,10316992,F31NS118930,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Foundations ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Reference Values ', ' Reference Ranges ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' Recovery ', ' Disease Progression ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Attenuated ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' subdermal ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' Equation ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' success ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modeling ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Predictive Value ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' contrast imaging ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' multiple sclerosis patient ', ' MS patient ', ' patients with MS ', ' patients with multiple sclerosis ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' classification algorithm ', ' Patient imaging ', ' data harmonization ', ' harmonized data ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2021,45686
"Renal MRI Biomarkers: The Route to Clinical Adoption Project Summary/ Abstract Functional renal MRI biomarkers are underused in research and clinical practice due to the need for dedicated in-house expertise and development. Transferring solutions to other centers is therefore a challenge, leading to a significant duplication of efforts, a lack of standardization in the methods, and difficulties in comparing results between centers. This also limits commercial buy-in, hinders the establishment of multi-center trials, and overall impedes the translation of these biomarkers into clinical practice. Our proposed workshop (https://www.ismrm.org/workshops/2021/Renal/) aims to bridge this gap. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together internationally recognized scientists and clinicians with new investigators who are currently developing and applying advanced renal MRI techniques in order to investigate the causes and consequences of kidney disease. The program of this workshop integrates clinical presentations outlining the needs for non-invasive testing and biomarkers with presentations on recent advances in contrast-based MRI, new applications of relaxometry, diffusion, and elastography, multinuclear applications, pre-clinical animal studies, and application of artificial intelligence techniques. With an important focus on the next generation, the workshop will include mentoring sessions for trainees and new investigators, called “Meet the Experts.” These mentoring sessions will provide specific information on clinical trials design, funding and regulations, as well as a hands-on “how I do it” sessions on available imaging post-processing software. This workshop is designed for researchers (including Ph.D. students and postdocs); clinicians (e.g., radiologists, nephrologists, renal transplant surgeons); MR technologists; government regulatory experts; nonprofit and academic groups interested in early diagnosis of renal disease; as well as members of the ISMRM, ASN, and PARENCHIMA. The program is designed for both senior investigators and junior scientists, with relevant topics for our attendees interested in continuing medical education. It presents knowledge of new methodologies in using quantitative MRI to diagnose and monitor a range of medical conditions, e.g., renal tissue injury, oxygenation, contrast and non-contrast perfusion, renal pre-transplant and post- transplant evaluations, etc. We will provide methods for utilizing this knowledge in clinical trials and practice, as well as guidance on data analysis. A key element of our plan is to reach out to women and minorities to encourage them to attend and participate in our workshop. This workshop will be a first in North America but follows three previous European meetings co-organized by the UK Renal Imaging Network (UKRIN) and the COST action “MRI Biomarkers for Chronic Kidney Disease” (PARENCHIMA). (https://renalmri.org). These previous workshops were attended by over 150 participants and presenters. Thus, we expect robust interest in the community for the proposed workshop.

"Multi-Center Implementation and Validation of Efficient Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Analysis of Atherosclerotic Disease of the Cervical Carotid Abstract: Numerous investigations over the past decades have yielded substantial innovations in MR methods for the characterization of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis. Images obtained with these innovations under ideal conditions have given clinicians rich information about disease in the arterial wall and the hope for tools critically needed for adequate management of this insidious disease. Despite this, the great potential power of this technology has not made it into the routine clinical armamentarium. Indeed, because of the need for gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA), the long exam time (typically about 45 minutes to obtain the multiple contrasts in the 5 or 6 necessary sequences), and the steep learning curve required to interpret multi- contrast MRI most practitioners still revert to the simplified metric of diameter stenosis in assessing risk. After many collective years of investigations, the consortium of investigators collaborating on this proposal believes that the time is right to address these remaining limitations and ultimately shift the clinical paradigm. Overarching hypothesis: To achieve the great potential in the management of cervical carotid disease, a highly efficient and easily used MRI technique is required. Our hypothesis is that this can be accomplished using multi-parametric non-contrast MRI sequences coupled with the latest high signal to noise ratio (SNR) neck-shape-specific (NSS) RF coils and innovative machine learning (deep neural network) analysis methods. Aim 1: We will install identical RF coils, MRI sequences, and protocols at each of our 5 participating centers as well as rigorously test the accuracy of measurements and reproducibility of image quality from all centers. Aim 2: We will develop, train, and validate a user friendly, deep learning neural network system for the quantitative analysis of several key components considered to be present in the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Aim 3: We will apply the analysis to a cohort of carotid disease subjects to establish the repeatability of the quantitative measures, as well as the accuracy of characterization in comparison to histopathology. Although we will develop and test the image quality, reproducibility and reliability in a network of highly skilled academic centers, we will design these methods to be applicable in the community hospital setting. At the conclusion of this project, we propose to have an integrated solution that can be used in subsequent investigations such as: the effect of pharmacologic intervention in modifying the composition of the plaque; studying the evolution of features of the untreated atheromatous disease over time; and, eventually, investigating the metrics that are predictive of deleterious outcomes, and that can be used in improving intervention strategies in this population. On successful completion, the RF coils and MRI sequences and analysis methods will be made available to other imaging centers in a manner that ultimately changes the paradigm of diagnosis and managing the treatment of cervical carotid atherosclerotic disease. Narrative: The goal of this project is to develop and test at multiple centers a highly efficient and easily used MRI technique for the analysis and management of cervical carotid disease. We will accomplish this using multi- parametric non-contrast MRI sequences coupled with the latest high signal to noise ratio (SNR) neck-shape- specific (NSS) RF coils and innovative machine learning (deep neural network) analysis methods.",Multi-Center Implementation and Validation of Efficient Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Analysis of Atherosclerotic Disease of the Cervical Carotid,10280858,R01HL159200,"['Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Carotid Arteries ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Equipment ', ' Evolution ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Atheroma ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Goals ', ' Histology ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Neck ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Reading ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vendor ', ' Measures ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cervical ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Carotid Atheroscleroses ', ' Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Carotid Artery Plaque ', ' carotid plaque ', ' Carotid Artery Plaques ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' RF coil ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Validation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' user-friendly ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,1331073
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10232306,R01AR077604,"['Affect ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical

"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron

"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Abstract Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with preferential delivery of 90Y microspheres to target lesions has shown promising response rates with limited toxicity in the treatment of hepatocellular (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. However, to achieve more durable responses, there is much room to improve/adapt the treatment to ensure that all lesions and lesion sub-regions receive adequate radiation delivery. While externally delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well suited for smaller solitary HCC, its application for larger or multifocal disease is challenged by the radiation tolerance of the normal liver parenchyma. A dosimetry guided combined approach that exploits complementary advantages of internal and external radiation delivery can be expected to improve treatment of HCC. To make this transition, however, prospective clinical trials establishing safety are needed. Furthermore, for routine clinic use, accurate and fast voxel-level dose estimation in internal radionuclide therapy, that lags behind external beam therapy dosimetry, is still needed. Our long-term goal is to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy with personalized dosimetry guided treatment. Our objective in this application is to demonstrate that it is possible to use 90Y imaging based absorbed dose estimates after SIRT to safely deliver external radiation to target regions (voxels) that are predicted to be underdosed and to develop deep learning based tools to make voxel-level internal dose estimation practical for routine clinic use. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a Phase 1 clinical trial in HCC patients where we will take the novel approach of using the 90Y PET/CT derived absorbed dose map after SIRT to deliver SBRT to tumor regions predicted to be underdosed based on previously established dose-response models. The primary objective of the trial is to obtain estimates of safety of combined SIRT+SBRT for future Phase II trial design. In parallel, in Aim 2, building on promising initial results we will develop novel deep learning based tools for 90Y PET/CT and SPECT/CT reconstruction, joint reconstruction-segmentation and scatter estimation under the low count-rate setting, typical for 90Y. These methods have a physics/mathematics foundation, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are included within the iterative reconstruction process, instead of post-reconstruction denoising. In Aim 3, we will develop a CNN for fast voxel-level dosimetry and combine with the CNNs of Aim 2 to develop an innovative end-to-end framework with unified dosimetry-task based training. At the end of this study, we will be ready to use the new deep learning tools in a Phase II trial to demonstrate enhanced efficacy with SIRT+SBRT compared with SIRT alone and advance towards our long- term goal. This will accelerate adoption of these next-generation tools in clinical practice and will have a significant positive impact because treatment based on patient specific dosimetry will substantially improve efficacy, compared with current standard practice in SIRT. Although we focus on 90Y SIRT, our tools will be applicable in radionuclide therapy in general, a rapidly advancing treatment option. Narrative We will perform a Phase I clinical trial where standard-of-care Y-90 microsphere radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma will be followed by external radiation to target regions that are predicted to be underdosed by Y-90, based on patient specific dosimetry. In parallel, we will develop and test voxel-level internal dosimetry tools using convolution neural networks to make such dosimetry-based planning accurate and fast for routine clinic use. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided combination radiation treatment approach is likely to substantially improve patient outcome compared to current standard practice of internal or external radiation only.",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,10206138,R01EB022075,"['Adoption ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Joints ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Microspheres ', ' Microbeads ', ' Motivation ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Public Health ', ' Radiation Tolerance ', ' Radiation Sensitivity ', ' Radiosensitivity ', ' radio-sensitivity ', ' radiosensitive ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Photons ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Radionuclide therapy ', ' therapeutic radionuclide ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' Funding ', ' Y-90 ', ' Yttrium 90 ', ' 90Y ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Performance ', ' dosimetry ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Hepatic Parenchyma ', ' Liver parenchyma ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' phase I protocol ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Implant Radiation ', ' internal radiation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Evaluable Disease ', ' Evaluable ', ' External Beam Radiation Therapy ', ' Definitive Radiation Therapy ', ' EBRT ', ' External Beam RT ', ' External Radiation ', ' external-beam radiation ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' PET/CT scan ', ' PET/CT ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Joint repair ', ' joint reconstruction ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' tumor ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical practice ', ' Radioembolization ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' phase II trial ', ' phase 2 trial ', ' trial design ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' radiation delivery ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,657625
"Multivariate Modeling of the Neural Mechanisms of Treatment Response in Opioid Addiction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed K01 project will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and machine learning (ML) to elucidate the neurocognitive processes underlying treatment failure in young adults with opioid use disorder (OUD). Young adults are at particularly high risk of OUD and fatal opioid overdose. The monthly injectable extended-release opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a highly effective OUD treatment and is particularly well suited for young adults. However, XR-NTX adherence and relapse show considerable individual variability, and the behavioral and clinical factors associated with such variability remain inconclusive. Previous research has demonstrated the potential for multimodal MRI and ML techniques to elucidate the neurocognitive factors that contribute to treatment response beyond behavioral and clinical measures. This project will take advantage of the cutting-edge MRI and ML methods to model brain structures and functions that predict XR-NTX treatment outcomes in young adults with OUD. The study will evaluate 18–34 year-old OUD patients before and during the first three months of XR-NTX treatment, a period associated with the highest rate of dropout from treatment. The primary outcome will be opioid relapse confirmed by weekly urine toxicology and self-report. The secondary outcome will be non-adherence defined as failure to complete the first three injections. The study will focus on five baseline measures of brain structures and functions that are potentially predictive of treatment response: 1) grey matter volume; 2) functional connectivity with the ventral striatum; 3) reactivity to opioid cues; 4) inhibitory control; and 5) self-evaluation. ML techniques will be used to reveal the patterns of brain structures/functions that are associated with each outcome variable. Based on literature and preliminary findings, we anticipate that combining MRI with behavioral and clinical assessments will better account for individual variability in XR-NTX treatment outcomes in young adults with OUD, than using the behavioral and clinical variables alone. The data will unveil novel brain mechanisms that contribute to the risk of treatment failure in this critical population. The project will also serve as a training vehicle for Dr. Zhenhao Shi to improve his clinical and computational skills and facilitate his independent career development. Specifically, it will enable Dr. Shi to achieve five training goals: 1) to advance his knowledge in the methodology of clinical research; 2) to gain hands-on experience in leading clinical projects; 3) to master ML and multivariate methodologies; 4) to apply multimodal MRI techniques to translational and clinical research; and 5) to advance his general independent research skills including leadership, networking, collaboration, scientific writing and grantsmanship. Through a combination of didactic and hands-on activities, the project will fulfill Dr. Shi's training needs and enable his transition to a successful and independent research career in applying advanced computational approaches to the neuroscience research of substance use disorders and their treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed K01 project will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning techniques to elucidate the structural and functional brain mechanisms underlying treatment failure in young adults receiving treatment with injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid use disorder. This project will unveil the neural mechanisms underlying individual variability in XR-NTX treatment response in a population of high importance to the efforts to curb the opioid crisis. It will facilitate Dr. Zhenhao Shi's transition to an independent computational addiction neuroscientist and help inform future research of, and intervention strategies for, opioid

"Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers PROJECT SUMMARY  Gynecologic cancers are some of the most lethal diseases affecting women. Globally, one woman dies of cervical cancer every two minutes. MRI is increasingly used in the evaluation of gynecologic and many other cancers. Beyond its established use for cancer staging, there has long been an interest in the use of MRI-derived quantitative metrics to gain insights into the tumor microenvironment. Parametric maps obtained from quantification of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI data can be used to study tumor vascularity and identify tumors that are better perfused and oxygenated and thus more sensitive to some treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. However, the relative slow imaging speed and motion sensitivity of current MRI technology results in non-reliable and non-reproducible quantification of DCE-MRI data, which restricts its application in clinical practice.  Our group is a world leader in development of rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI techniques, in particular using combinations of radial imaging and compressed sensing. We developed the technique called GRASP, which was conceived as an academic-industrial partnership and has now been successfully translated into standard clinical practice. Though powerful, the first generation of GRASP has limitations. First, radial imaging is robust to motion, but not free of motion, which usually results in blurring. Second, GRASP uses a very simple sparsifying transform for compressed sensing, which can introduce issues with quantification. Third, GRASP was not originally developed for pharmacokinetic analysis and misses important ingredients such as integration of AIF estimation and T1 mapping. Fourth, image reconstruction time is still very long – in the order of several minutes.  We have developed new advances to circumvent these limitations and offer a new DCE-MRI technique with increased speed, motion-resistance and personalized AIF estimation and T1 mapping for pharmacokinetic analysis. Following the PAR-18-009 guidelines, our main goal is to form an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to translate these new developments in quantitative DCE-MRI for use in patients with gynecologic and other type of cancers. Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Develop and implement a fast motion-resistant quantitative DCE-MRI technique that goes beyond GRASP  to offer increased speed and resistance to motion; dynamic T1 mapping; and personalized and automated  pharmacokinetic analysis 2. Evaluate the repeatability, reproducibility and preliminary tumor response assessment of the fast motion-  robust quantitative DCE-MRI technique (“DCE-new”) and compare DCE-new to standard of care DCE-MRI  (“DCE-standard”) in patients with gynecologic cancer 3. Develop and evaluate fast image reconstruction algorithms based on deep learning PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to establish an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to develop and disseminate advances in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI for use in cancer patients. The new developments, which include radial imaging, compressed sensing, and deep learning, will deliver rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI with high spatial and temporal resolution for more accurate and reproducible quantification of MRI-derived metrics. The new technology to be disseminated as a prototype on GE scanners will promote the use of quantitative DCE-MRI biomarkers in clinical practice, a long-desired goal.",Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers,10267713,R01CA244532,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Automation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Gynecology ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' New York ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Relapse ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Gynecologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Licensing ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' chemoradiation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Female Reproductive Cancer ', ' Gynecologic Cancer ', ' Gynecological Cancer ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' gynecologic malignancy ', ' gynecological malignancy ', ' Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' MSKCC ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' reconstruction ', ' anticancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' Imaging technology ', ' cancer type ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' motion sensitivity ', ' population based ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment response ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' industry partner ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' clinical practice ', ' individualized medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapeutic strategy ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' improved outcome ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Treatment-related side effects ', ' Chemotherapy and/or radiation ', ' Chemotherapy and Radiation ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,568123
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10220967,R44EB024438,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Angiography ', ' Angiogram ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Animals ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Heart ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Public Health ', ' radiation effect ', ' Reperfusion Therapy ', ' reperfusion ', ' Rotation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Vendor ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' voltage ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Data ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' temporal measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' contrast imaging ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' preservation ', ' deep learning ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' low dose computed tomography ', ' low dose computerized tomography ', ' low-dose CT ', ' ']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2021,767835
"Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images ABSTRACT The goal of this R03 Small Grant Program for NIDDK is to provide additional funding for Dr. Kline to expand upon his work on his K award and apply his expertise to new image acquisitions and problems related to renal imaging. Dr. Kline’s work has piqued the interest of many internal and external investigators and has led to recent collaborations with Drs. Rule, Denic, and Kim. Together with Dr. Erickson, this new research team has prepared this R03 proposal which takes advantage of the unique expertise of each team member. The focus of this proposal is to bridge the gap between microscopic observations and those assessable non-invasively by radiological imaging. To do this, we have established a unique dataset of renal CT imaging data and corresponding biopsy measured nephron densities. We have also generated a large database of gold-standard segmentation data of kidneys, cortical regions, and medullary pyramids. Using this existing data, we propose to: (i) develop tools for segmentation of kidneys, segmentation of individual medullary pyramids, and imputing missing parts of the kidneys outside of the imaged field-of-view in the CT image, and (ii) to establish imaging biomarkers of early CKD, and correlate macroscopic imaging findings to underlying microscopic structure. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Aging Kidney Anatomy Study (PI: Rule), which led to the generation of this unique and well characterized dataset. Dr. Kline’s background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly well suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, near the end of this research project Dr. Kline will submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of renal imaging biomarkers. Obtaining this R03 Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline’s transition into a prosperous independent researcher focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. Narrative Non-invasive methods for characterizing micro-structural changes of the kidney during aging as well as in health and disease are currently not possible. This research program proposes to use our existing database of renal imaging and renal biopsy data to bridge the gap between macroscopic radiological findings on computed tomography images to those assessable in microscopic images of renal biopsies. This program will develop new automated methods for performing measurements on the images, as well as use machine/deep learning methods to search for new imaging biomarkers that relate to nephron density and size, as well as establish their usefulness for early chronic kidney disease detection and transplant planning.",Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure

"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies.

"Identifying optimal dynamic strategies for prostate cancer control PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Big Data has the potential to revolutionize cancer research and care, but extracting the information it holds on the optimal strategies for cancer control will require cutting-edge tools in data science. The optimal strategies for cancer control will be dynamic strategies that adapt clinical decisions over time to a patient’s evolving clinical history. Unfortunately, conventional statistical methods cannot appropriately compare dynamic strategies, so we need methods specifically designed for this task: g-methods. G-methods have helped to shape clinical care in many areas, but they have not been systematically applied to cancer research. Further, while g-methods let us validly estimate the effect of pre-specified strategies, these may not be the optimal strategies. My overarching goal is to apply and further develop analytic methods to learn the optimal strategies for cancer control from complex longitudinal data and generate user-friendly, publicly-available software to make these methods available to the cancer research community. I will apply these methods to answer key clinical questions across the prostate cancer control continuum: 1) the optimal dietary and lifestyle strategies to prevent aggressive prostate cancer, 2) the optimal screening strategy following a baseline PSA test to maximize detection of aggressive disease while minimizing detection of indolent tumors, and 3) the optimal statin therapy strategy to maximize survival among men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. This project will leverage data from a large prospective cohort study and a novel platform of electronic health records linked with genetic data. I will first apply g-methods to estimate the effects of recommended strategies for cancer control that a randomized trial would have limited feasibility to evaluate. I will then investigate whether novel methods that learn the optimal strategies from the data may lead to improved, targeted recommendations that get the right interventions to the right people at the right time. This innovative project will advance comparative effectiveness research for cancer care at the cutting edge of data science. I am optimally positioned to undertake this research based on my 1) expertise in cancer, epidemiology, and causal inference; 2) exceptional multidisciplinary mentoring team comprised of global leaders in their respective fields; and 3) unparalleled research environment to support my career development. Through this work, I will expand my expertise in new areas, including machine learning. The proposed research and training will help me achieve my long-term career goal to become an independent investigator and lead a transdisciplinary research program that integrates causal inference and machine learning to identify optimal strategies for cancer control. Leveraging rich, existing data, this proposal represents a significant opportunity to develop, apply, and disseminate powerful methods for big clinical data to accelerate progress in cancer research and care.

"Ultrasound-based sensors for the fusion and motion correction of MRI and PET/CT data Project summary Radiology departments are equipped with many different types of medical imaging scanners, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Computed Tomography (CT), X-ray, ultrasound imaging (USI) and Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), among others. Clearly, none of these modalities is ideal; otherwise, there would be no rationale for anybody to purchase any others. Each modality is characterized by its own contrast mechanism and provides its own type of information.  An ideal scanner might be defined here as one that could provide any of these contrasts, whose hardware would include that required for all of the main scanning techniques, whereby one could simply select the desired scan type, e.g., MRI+CT+USI, and proceed. Clearly, in practice, such an ideal scanner would be quite impractical. Hardware components associated with each modality would compete for the small amount of space available around the patient and these components would interfere in ways that might seriously impede their functioning. Even if such technical problems could be solved, complexity would likely drive cost to prohibitive heights. A more realistic multi-modality strategy is to perform scans sequentially, on different physical scanners, and to fuse images afterward, mostly through software. Exceptions include hybrid scanners such as PET/CT, which are widespread, and PET/MRI, which are available but uncommon. The fact that both involve PET is not a coincidence, but rather a testimony to the fact that PET may well currently be the best available tool for diagnosing/staging cancer, and that it further requires good anatomical images such as those provided by CT or MRI for proper attenuation correction maps to be calculated.  In particular, PET/MRI scanners are true masterpieces of engineering. The two combined modalities prove especially useful in the fields of cancer detection/staging and neuroscience. Arguably, the main problem with these scanners may be that they are rare and very expensive, two problems that are not unrelated of course. Masterpieces of engineering may demand respect but they also tend to demand a high price; in contrast, the present project represents a practical and low-cost approach to multi-modality imaging. For the same reasons that drove vendors to develop PET/MRI scanners, because both modalities are so powerful in their own rights yet so complementary as well, we focus here on combining PET and MRI acquisitions. But the proposed work is not limited to these two scan types, and in the future it might well prove generalizable to any combination of sequential scans from any imaging modalities and/or radiation therapy devices. It is based on the developments of ultrasound-based sensors that can be attached to the patient's skin and accompany him/her through sequential scans, acting as a common thread across modalities. Fifty-four patients scheduled for a clinical PET/CT scan will be recruited to validate the proposed technology, and half of them will be scanned by MRI as well. Project narrative Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners provide different and complementary diagnostic information; while PET/MRI systems combine both technologies into a same physical scanner, such multi-modality scanners tend to be very expensive and not widely available. A small, low-cost ultrasound-based sensor that attaches to the skin is proposed here that can act as a common thread between sequentially-performed PET and MRI scans, allowing data from separate scanners to be combined and fused in effect as if they had come from a single multi-modality scanner.",Ultrasound-based sensors for the fusion and motion correction of MRI and PET/CT data,10092861,R01EB030470,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Award ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Engineering ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Gamma Rays ', ' Gamma Radiation ', ' γ-Radiation ', ' γ-Ray ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patient Schedules ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Publishing ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rights ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Emission-Computed Tomography ', ' Computed Tomographic Scintigraphy ', ' Computerized Emission Tomography ', ' Radionuclide CAT Scan ', ' radionuclide emission tomography ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Localized Disease ', ' Attenuated ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' respiratory ', ' magnetic field ', ' attenuation ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Skin ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Curved Tube ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' image registration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' imaging system ', ' contrast imaging ', ' anatomic imaging ', ' anatomical imaging ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' motion sensor ', ' data streams ', ' ']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,1342160
"Machine learning accelerated on-line adaptive replanning Abstract. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and test a novel machine learning (ML) accelerated On-Line Adaptive Replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation therapy (RT) (MRgRT). During the multi-fraction RT process, the location, shape and size of tumors and normal organs vary significantly between the fractions. These interfraction variations are among the major factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT), developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue, researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery. Project Narrative: This R01 application proposes to develop and test a novel machine learning accelerated online adaptive replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided adaptive radiation therapy through a unique academic and industry partnership. The MOLAR solution aims to fully account for interfraction variations, thereby substantially improving the accuracy and effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) for cancer.

"Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that delivery of higher radiation doses to the prostate results in improved tumor control rates in prostate cancer radiation therapy (RT). As local recurrence mostly occurs at the primary tumor, particularly for high-risk patients, additional dose escalation is expected to improve the treatment outcome. However, the application of dose escalation for prostate RT is greatly limited by the tolerance of nearby healthy tissues that cannot adequately be excluded from the radiation field. This limitation can be overcome by dose painting, where a higher dose is applied to the prostate tumor only instead of the whole prostate gland. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers reduced treatment time, convenience, and possibly increased treatment efficacy as compared to the conventionally fraction scheme. UTSW is currently conducting a dose escalation trial using SBRT for high-risk prostate cancer patients with an integrated dose boost on MRI-visualized prostate tumor. However, prostate can move and deform during the beam delivery. To ensure the escalated dose is actually delivered to tumor regions as planned, a reliable tumor tracking method is urgently needed. While intra-prostatic tumors can be identified by multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment planning, intrafraction tumor tracking during the beam delivery is not achievable with mpMRI. In contrast, ultrasound offers a cost-effective and real-time imaging with high soft tissue contrast. However, conventional ultrasound techniques only provide anatomic structure of the prostate gland without the capability to differentiate tumor region from the rest of the prostate gland. Temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) has emerged as a new paradigm for prostate tissue characterization by analyzing the time-series ultrasound images with advanced machine learning techniques. In this project, we aim to develop, optimize and evaluate an innovative TeUS based intra-prostatic tumor tracking method to guide SBRT with an integrated dose boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The specific aims are: 1) Develop TeUS-based intra-prostatic tumor delineation for guiding focused dose escalation; 2) Integrate and validate TeUS-based tumor tracking system during SBRT; and 3) Evaluate clinical gain of TeUS guided SBRT for high risk prostate cancer patients. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development and validation of a low-cost yet highly accurate TeUS guided system for targeted prostate cancer RT. With enhanced real-time visualization of tumor, the use of TeUS for RT guidance will lead to better treatment efficacy and reduced toxicity. Delivery of higher radiation doses to the tumor region can improve outcome of radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients. As the prostate can move and deform during radiation beam delivery, there is an urgent need for a reliable method to ensure escalated dose is delivered to the tumor region as planned. We will develop, integrate and evaluate a novel prostate tumor tracking method based on temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) to guide radiation therapy for high-risk patients, which will lead to higher local control with improved toxicity.",Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT,10107816,R01EB027898,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Rectum ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rest ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Urethra ', ' urethral ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Series ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Lesion ', ' soft tissue ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' vibration ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' cohort ', ' treatment planning ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Modality ', ' Radiation ', ' Cancer Radiotherapy ', ' cancer radiation therapy ', ' Dose ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' External Beam Radiation Therapy ', ' Definitive Radiation Therapy ', ' EBRT ', ' External Beam RT ', ' External Radiation ', ' external-beam radiation ', ' Scheme ', ' Validation ', ' Prostatic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' cost effective ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Therapy trial ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' improved outcome ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' early phase trial ', ' deep learning ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' Visualization ', ' advanced prostate cancer ', ' prostate lesions ', ' prostatic lesions ', ' ']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,344156
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications.

"Multi-Site Clinical Data to Power MRI Biomarker of Neonatal Brain Injury Abstract This project aims to release our recently gathered existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE affects 1-5/1000 term-born neonates and is a major cause of early-childhood mortality and morbidity. Neonatal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is acquired routinely for the clinical care of HIE. Neonatal brain MRI is expected to reveal 3D neuroanatomic mechanisms of adverse outcomes so that we can design new treatments specifically target those mechanisms. Neonatal brain MRI also carries hope to identify those neonates who are at risk to develop adverse outcomes later in life, so that early intervention program can target those at-risk neonates for maximum benefit. Despite MRI's vital role in caring for HIE, the current norm in clinical practice is to read MRI visually by expert neuroradiologist or neurologist. Expert reads, however, has many limitations – subjective, qualitative, insufficient to reveal mechanisms, and inadequate to predict outcomes. Objective and quantitative analysis of MRI is possible with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical and neuroimaging informatics. A major limitation, however, is the lack of publicly-available data on HIE. Our project aims to fill this gap, by archiving and releasing our clinically-acquired, large-scale (N=231), and multi-site (2 hospitals) data on HIE. Our data was acquired partly funded by NIH R01 (2012-2017) and foundations (2016-2020). Our data is comprehensive, including clinical data elements (from both mothers and neonates), neonatal brain MRI (structural and diffusion sequences), expert-consensus annotation of lesion regions in neonatal brain MRI, NICU outcome (death/survival, length of stay), and 2-year-old neurocognitive outcomes (normal/adverse, yes/no for development dealy, yes/no for the hearing/visual/motor impairment, and yes/no for cerebral palsy). Our data is also representative, coming from patients with different racial/ethnicity groups, in patients with a wide range of outcomes, from different MRI scanners (Siemens 3T or GE 1.5T), with different imaging protocols, and MRI scanned on different days of life. We will also derive new data from existing data. The anonymized (de-identified) data will be released to the NCBI dbGaP platform with the “Controlled Access” option, requiring IRB and data use agreement (DUA). The derived data will be released to dbGaP with the “Open Access” option, freely downloadable without any approval. Both release options are consistent with other clinical and MRI data that have already been released on dbGaP. We hope this first comprehensive data will boost future collaborative efforts for AI to automatically identify HIE lesions in MRI, and for AI to accurately predict HIE outcome integrating clinical and MRI information. Project Narrative We aim to publicly release our existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal brain injury caused by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Our data were retrospectively collected partially funded by NIH R01 (2012-2017) and two other foundational/institutional grant (2016-2020); our data is comprehensive (clinical data from mothers and neonates, neonatal brain MRI with expert-consensus annotations of HIE lesions, and complete set of outcome measures by 2 years of age); our data is representative (MRI scanner, age at MRI, MRI protocol, patient outcomes, patient racial/ethnicity groups); and our data is multi-site (2 hospitals) and large-scale (N=231 compared to proprietary studies with dozens of patients). We plan to use this first public clinical and brain MRI data for HIE to boost artificial intelligence (AI) research for HIE lesion detection and outcome prediction, toward promoting outcomes in this vulnerable neonatal population.",Multi-Site Clinical Data to Power MRI Biomarker of Neonatal Brain Injury,10194889,R03HD104891,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Archives ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atlases ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Ethnic People ', ' Ethnic Population ', ' Ethnicity People ', ' Ethnicity Population ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Hearing ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human Development ', ' natural hypothermia ', ' Hypothermia ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Study of magnetics ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Morbidity -

"Fast Multi-dimensional Diffusion MRI with Sparse Sampling and Model-based Deep Learning Reconstruction Project Summary: Neurodegenerative disorders are a significant public health and economic problem and are the leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding the specific degenerative processes that are actively progressing over the course of the illness is crucial for developing targeted drugs therapies and deciding treatment options. Additionally, understanding the structural connectivity changes to tease apart the specific circuitry affected is crucial in developing circuit specific non-invasive brain stimulation therapies. Diffusion- based MRI assays can provide microstructural measures that are highly sensitive to (i) the neurodegenerative processes and (ii) connectivity changes. Advanced modeling approaches can be utilized to further enhance the specificity of the microstructural measures to the underlying neurodegenerative processes. However, their utility is often limited to pure white matter regions. At the typical spatial resolution of diffusion MRI (~2mm isotropic voxel size), significant partial volume effects exist in most brain voxels (e.g., voxels with multiple tissue types, heterogenous fibers with different properties). In whole brain studies, this compromises the specificity of the disease processes identified by the advanced modeling approaches; it also contributes to inaccurate connectivity mapping. Additionally, the diffusion parameter encoding space is currently limited to one or two shells of low b-values (b<2000s/mm2), which limits the unique determination of several relevant microstructural parameters. The main objective of the proposal is the development, validation and clinical translation of a diffusion MRI assay that enable efficient encoding of diffusion parameter space at sub- millimeter voxel resolution for joint microstructure and connectivity mapping in the whole brain. Our overall hypothesis is that the proposed framework can significantly improve the validity of microstructural modeling in most brain voxels. The proposed development will make use of SNR-efficient 3D multi-slab acquisitions. Coupled with time-efficient sparse k-q sampling, the encoding will span over multiple b-shells. To allow the unique determination of several relevant microstructural parameters, multicompartmental T2 information will be utilized. The proposed developments will be enabled by two advanced reconstruction methods: structured low- rank matrix completion, a novel integrative framework for MRI reconstructions that enables several capabilities including multi-echo imaging and self-calibrating reconstruction; and model-based deep learning, a novel deep architecture to solve MR reconstruction algorithms using neural networks in a systematic fashion. These methods overcome several inefficiencies associated with extending the 3D multi-slab acquisition for multi- dimensional imaging in the k-q-TE space. To ensure scientific rigor, we will comprehensively validate our technology on dedicated diffusion phantoms along with healthy volunteers using different quantification metrics. We also validate the capability of the dMRI assay using a multi-modal MRI study in a cross-sectional study on a cohort of Huntington's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Neurodegenerative disorders are a significant public health and economic problem affecting about 450 million people worldwide are the leading cause of disability and ill-health according to world health organization. The main objective of the proposal is the development, validation and translation of a non-invasive diffusion MRI assay, that enable efficient encoding of diffusion parameter space to characterize the neurodegenerative processes that drive the progression of neurodegeneration.

"Brain phantom generation by generative adversarial net (GAN) for AI-based emission tomography Project Summary  Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are useful functional medical imaging techniques that can be performed to evaluate brain functions such as regional cerebral perfusion and neurotransmission. The spatial resolution of reconstruction for PET is usually 3-6 mm, and for SPECT is only 1-2 cm. Motivated by the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) and its successful application to MRI and CT, it is highly desirable to develop an ML-based system for PET/SPECT cerebral image reconstruction (one of our specific interests is Parkinson disease) to achieve higher resolution and lower noise than using conventional approaches. However, to develop such a learning system, ground-truth data (accurate images, used as the labels) that guide the training are unavailable from the the real world. Published ML systems for PET imaging have used reconstructed images from conventional methods as the label to guide the training. As a result, the goal was only targeted to improve reconstruction speed, rather than improving the image quality. Since the quality of reconstructed image by ML system cannot exceed the guiding images, the performance of ML system cannot surpass conventional methods. Therefore, in this project, we propose a two-year project that will use conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) to generate digital 2-D human brain phantoms, which will be highly similar to real human brains. The generated phantoms will serve as the (precise) ground-truth data to develop ML-based PET/SPECT reconstruction systems (our future research). The generated phantoms will contain an activity image and an attenuation map. Hence, results from this work can be used for simulating brain PET or SPECT examinations for various neurological disorders, and neural network can be trained with known ground truth. In addition, designing ML systems often relies on large amounts of data, but it is not easy to access data from a large number of patients in the US for specific medical research (mature ML systems developed for computer vision and image classification often involve images on the million level for training). Existing ML systems developed for MRI, CT, and PET imaging often merely uses a few tens of patient data for training and even less data to validate. Therefore, those systems are high-likely overfitted to the data used in training. With the generation system proposed from this project, we can produce a large phantom population to avoid the overfitting problem when design the AI image-reconstruction system. Once the GAN system is successfully developed, it can be easily transplanted to phantom generation for the AI-based CT and AI-based MRI. The method is also potentially extendable to generate phantom populations of torso, abdomen, and extremities for simulating cardiac imaging, tumor imaging, etc. Project Narrative  A two-year small project for generating 2-D digital brain phantoms by generative adversarial net (GAN). The generator can generate artificial digital phantoms very similar to realistic phantoms, so a large number of ground-truth images become available for developing machine-learning-based emission tomography.",Brain phantom generation by generative adversarial net (GAN) for AI-based emission tomography,10293006,R03EB030653,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' bone ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Noise ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physics ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Publishing ', ' putamen ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Training Support ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Medical Research ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Collimation ', ' Collimator ', ' Width ', ' interest ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' cardiac imaging ', ' cardiac scanning ', ' heart scanning ', ' heart imaging ', ' Performance ', ' radiolabel ', ' radiotracer ', ' attenuation ', ' Speed ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' simulation ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Scheme ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' Population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' data access ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,81875
"Next-generation in-vivo fetal neuroimaging Next-Generation In-Vivo Fetal Neuroimaging The overall objective of this project is to dramatically improve fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to advance research in early human brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders, the burden of which is, unfortunately, high because of their life-long impact and high prevalence. Fetal MRI has been the technique of choice in studying prenatal brain development. Fetal motion, however, makes MRI slice acquisition unreliable at best, as the fetus frequently moves while the prescribed slices are imaged. Uncompensated fetal motion disrupts 3D coverage of the anatomy and reduces the spatial resolution of slice-to-volume reconstructions. Repeating the scans does not ensure full 3D coverage of the anatomy, but increases total acquisition time. This, in turn, dramatically reduces the success rate and reliability of fetal MRI in studying the development of transient fetal brain compartments that are selectively sensitive to injury over the course of fetal development. To mitigate these issues and improve fetal MRI, we propose to automatically measure fetal brain position and prospectively navigate slices to each new position in real-time. The impact of this approach will be to dramatically increase the success rate and spatial resolution of fetal MRI for the in-vivo investigation of developing brain compartments, while, in parallel, reducing scan time, effectively making fetal MRI less burdensome for the mother, more accurate, and cost effective. By eliminating the manual re- adjustment of stack-of-slice positions, the time that elapses between scans will be virtually continuous. Our proposed technique will also make fetal MRI less operator-dependent and thus, more reproducible across sites, which is essential to conducting multi-center studies and clinical trials. Prospective navigation of fetal MRI slices to compensate for motion requires the development of novel, real-time image processing algorithms to recognize the fetal brain and its position and orientation; to track fetal motion to steer slices; and to detect and re-acquire motion corrupted slices. In this project, we will develop innovative deep learning models to process fetal MRI slices in real-time; will translate those models into an integrated system to prospectively navigate fetal MRI slices; and will validate the system on fetuses scanned at various gestational ages. To assess the utility and impact of the proposed technology, we will measure subplate volume in fetuses. The four specific aims of this study are to 1) assess fetal MRI via variable density image acquisition and reconstruction; 2) achieve real-time recognition of the fetal brain in MRI slices; 3) develop a system of real-time fetal head motion tracking and steering of slices; and 4) measure the subplate volume in the developing fetal brain using MRI. These aims will collectively translate and validate new imaging and image processing techniques to advance fetal MRI, and effectively eliminate a critical barrier to making progress in the fields of developmental neurology and neuroscience. Project Narrative: The proposed research aims to develop, translate, and validate innovative in-vivo imaging technologies to improve imaging and studying the development of the human fetal brain before birth. The technology will enable and improve studies on the development of the brain in fetuses with congenital disorders or fetuses at risk of having neurodevelopmental issues later in life.

"Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Summary Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end stage renal disease. However, improvements in long-term allograft survival have not matched the observed improvements in the management of rejection. Progressive allograft dysfunction is frequently encountered clinically. The final common pathway of cumulative and incremental renal damage from several etiologies identified by histopathology is interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), which is associated with progression of renal dysfunction and reduced allograft survival. Histopathologic assessment and staging of IFTA requires tissue sampling, which is limited due to its invasive nature, risk of complications, inter-individual variability and sampling error. In this proposal, we will test a non-contrast advanced multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol comprised of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) as noninvasive markers of renal allograft fibrosis. This is motivated by our preliminary data demonstrating that mpMRI yields highly repeatable parameter measurements that capture allograft fibrosis. Our preliminary experience correlating mpMRI with IFTA is valuable, as confounding physiologic and pathophysiologic variables such as vascular flow, edema and other Banff phenotypes commonly co-exist. The multiparametric approach allows us to simultaneously capture and characterize these concurrent physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. As a secondary objective, we will assess the value of urinary RNA level based biomarkers, which have been previously validated for the diagnosis of IFTA. In this proposal, we aim to: 1) acquire data in patients undergoing indication and surveillance biopsy, using a non-contrast mpMRI protocol comprised of advanced diffusion weighted and relaxometry methods in order to accurately detect and stage allograft IFTA, and 2) other histopathological Banff measures of inflammation. We will build and validate diagnostic models using advanced statistical methods including machine learning in independent model-building and validation sets of renal transplant patients for detection and staging of each Banff measure, and assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of fibrosis. 3) We will evaluate the performance of mpMRI and urinary biomarkers to predict renal outcomes in a longitudinal study for the entire patient cohort up to 24 months. Our long-term objective is to validate a robust quantitative advanced mpMRI approach and develop models that accurately and non-invasively measure renal allograft fibrosis and clinical outcome, which may potentially impact the care of renal transplant patients by enabling early detection, the non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of disease, therapeutic efficacy of new drugs and for prognostication. Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Narrative Caused by a variety of etiologies, acute and chronic renal allograft injury often results in the development of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), is a significant cause of allograft failure and poor outcomes; the reference standard for which is tissue biopsy, which is limited due to sampling error and risk of complications. In this proposal, we will develop a short, non-contrast multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol, consisting of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) to accurately detect and stage allograft fibrosis, taking into account confounding Banff variables of inflammation and tested against biopsy. We will also assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of IFTA and if successful, this study will benefit a large population of patients with renal allograft fibrosis in the United States, enabling early diagnosis, optimized treatment planning, prognostication and longitudinal disease monitoring.",Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI

"Accuracy and Precision in CT Quantification of COPD Through Virtual Imaging Trials Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death. Increasing in prevalence, COPD is a major burden to patients and providers. Computed tomography (CT) can provide valuable information about the structural and functional abnormalities of the disease as demonstrated in numerous studies where quantitative CT is deployed to characterize and evaluate the treatment. For instance, the COPDGene study has recently shown the substantial role of quantitative CT in the redefinition of COPD diagnosis, and in evaluating the progression of emphysema over time. However, these biomarkers vary across different scanners, settings, and patient attributes. There is a crucial need to manage this variability by optimizing and harmonizing CT images for reliable biomarker quantifications across both current and emerging scanners. This goal is not possible through conventional methods of using physical phantoms or patient images. Physical phantoms are often oversimplified and not representative of the complex anatomy and physiology of COPD patients. Patient images are ground-truth-limited, i.e., the exact anatomy and physiology of the patient is not fully known. Further, patient-based comparisons require multiple acquisitions of the same subjects across different scanners and settings. This is not ethically possible since repeated imaging increases the absorbed radiation dose. These challenges can be overcome through the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) where studies are performed in silico using computational models of patients and scanners. VITs can provide reliable and practical solution to the challenge of COPD imaging provided realistic models of patients and scanners. Such models are currently lacking in the context of COPD. We develop and then utilize realistic virtual imaging toolsets to systematically evaluate and optimize CT biomarkers in COPD patients across scanners, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. We develop the first library of realistic COPD patient models with diverse attributes and severities. Coupled with accurate models of different scanners, the phantoms will be used to generate sets of ground-truth-known virtual CT cases, to be disseminated to the research community and to be used to systematically evaluate the effects of current and emerging scanners, various patient attributes, and the effects of image processing algorithms (through a national challenge), on the accuracy and precision of COPD biomarkers. Further, we develop and optimize a truth-based artificial intelligence-based algorithm for COPD quantifications. We optimize the algorithm for accuracy and reproducibility, taking advantage of the ground-truth known simulated images . We then harmonize CT settings across different scanners to accurately and precisely assess COPD imaging biomarkers for both single time-point and longitudinal studies. The studies will be done for the top two image processing algorithms, identified in the challenge, as well as our developed algorithm. Through these efforts, the project will position CT as a more reliable method for improved characterization and monitoring of COPD. Narrative The project aims to systematically evaluate and optimize quantitative CT imaging biomarkers in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, across scanner makes and models, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. This will be performed by developing and using in silico models of COPD patients and CT scanners.

"Computational Toolkit for Normalizing the Impact of CT Acquisition and Reconstruction on Quantitative Image Features Quantitative image features (QIFs) such as radiomic and deep features hold enormous potential to improve the detection, diagnosis, and treatment assessment of a wide range of diseases. Generated from clinically acquired Computed Tomography (CT) scans, QIFs represent small pixel-wise changes that may be early indicators of disease progression. However, detecting these changes is complicated by variations in the way that CT scans are performed, including variations in acquisition and reconstruction parameters. Ensuring reproducible QIFs is a prerequisite for developing machine learning (ML) models that achieve consistent performance across different clinical settings. This project's premise is that QIFs are sensitive to CT parameters such as radiation dose level, slice thickness, reconstruction kernel, and reconstruction method. The combined interactions among these parameters result in unique image conditions, each yielding its own QIF value. Moreover, some clinical tasks and algorithms are more sensitive to differences in QIF values than others. We hypothesize that a systematic, task-dependent framework to normalize scans and mitigate the impact of variability in CT parameters will identify reproducible QIFs and yield more consistent ML models. Three interrelated innovations will be pursued in this work: 1) a novel framework for characterizing the impact of different acquisition and reconstruction parameters on QIFs and ML models using patient scans with known clinical outcomes in multiple domains; 2) a systematic approach for selecting an optimal mitigation technique and evaluating the impact of normalization; and 3) an open-source software toolkit that formalizes the process of CT normalization, addressing real-world use cases developed by academic and industry collaborators. In Aim 1, we will evaluate how multiple CT parameters influence QIF values and model performance. Utilizing metrics of agreement and a heat map-based visualization, we will determine under which image acquisition and reconstruction conditions the QIFs and model performance are consistent. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate a generative adversarial network-based approach to normalization. Our investigation will focus on targeted mitigation of the set of imaging conditions that are most relevant to a clinical task and on the optimization of how these models are trained. In Aim 3, we will engage a spectrum of external stakeholders to guide the development and adoption of a software toolkit called CT-NORM. Three distinct clinical domains will drive our efforts: lung nodule detection (which relies on identifying small regions of high contrast differences to identify nodules), interstitial lung disease quantification (which depends on characterizing texture differences), and ischemic core assessment (which relies on detecting low contrast differences in brain tissue). CT-NORM will provide the scientific community with an approach and a unified toolkit to characterize and mitigate the impact of reconstruction and acquisition parameters on QIFs and ML model performance. By addressing critical sources of variability, we will improve the process of generating QIFs and facilitate the discovery of precise and reproducible imaging phenotypes of disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Computed Tomography (CT) images play an integral role in screening and diagnosing diseases such as lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, and stroke. While artificial intelligence/machine learning models have been con- structed using quantitative image features, model performance can be affected by variations in how the CT images are acquired and reconstructed. This project aims to investigate the effects of varying CT parameters on these image-derived features and to use that information to identify optimal techniques to mitigate their effects in a task-dependent manner.",Computational Toolkit for Normalizing the Impact of CT Acquisition and Reconstruction on Quantitative Image Features,10426507,R56EB031993,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Industry ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Play ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' Emphysema ', ' emphysematous ', ' Lung nodule ', ' pulmonary nodule ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Interstitial Lung Diseases ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' high resolution CT ', ' High Resolution Computed Tomography ', ' Industry Collaborators ', ' Industry Collaboration ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Sum ', ' Collection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Seminal ', ' Slice ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' disease phenotype ', ' reconstruction ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' clinical practice ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' screening ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' biomarker development ', ' radiomics ', ' clinical translation ', ' biomarker validation ', ' marker validation ', ' computed tomography screening ', ' CT screening ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' open source tool ', ' open source toolkit ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R56,2021,611968
"Validation of Biomarkers of Small Vessel Injury in VCID This proposal is in response to RFA-NS-21-005, which is a continuation of RFA-NS-16-020. The overall goal of the project is to study the impact of vascular disease on Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Small vessel disease is the major vascular disease associated with dementia. Cerebral small vessel diseases such as arteriolosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are independently associated with worse cognitive performance and greater likelihood of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). MarkVCID1 consortium shared subject clinical neuropsychological test data, MRI results and biological samples to validate the biomarkers. The NIH identified 11 biomarkers from MarkVCID1 that could be used in future clinical trials. The UNM site made major contributions to both the MRI and fluid biomarkers: UNM and UCD led the work on the Free Water (FW) biomarker, and contributed data to all of the other MRI biomarkers. UNM was one of the few centers that collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and matched blood on all subjects, contributing to all of the fluid biomarkers selected to move into MarkVCID2. Our group contributed CSF and blood samples to multiple sites for validation of the angiogenic and inflammatory biomarker kits, including CSF placental growth factor (PlGF), and blood exosomes and endothelial inflammation kits. We used MesoScale Discovery assays for fluid analysis, and have recently purchased a Quanterix HD-X single molecule assay (SIMOA) instrument that we will use it to measure neurofilament light (NfL) and PlGF. The UNM Specific aims are: 1) to continue to lead to development of the FW biomarker kit in collaboration with UCD to make this trial ready and to add imaging data to the other MRI biomarkers kits; 2) to continue to collect CSF and blood samples to contribute to the validation of all the CSF and blood biomarker kits; and 3) to recruit 200 new underrepresented patients over two years to add to legacy subjects. UMN anticipates to have longitudinal data for 3 years on many participants. UNM has a large number of patients with VCID, AD, and mixed dementias, as well as subjective cognitive complaints that have been studied as part of two RO1 grants (2006-2016) and the MarkVCID1 (2016- present) with data on clinical cognitive test results, MRI, CSF, and blood. Many of these patients have longitudinal data from multiple follow-ups. UNM is committed to achieving the goals and milestones laid out by NIH for MarkVCID2, and to contribute to the completion of the evaluation of the biomarkers that will be used with study-ready cohorts for clinical trials in vascular cognitive impairment. Narrative During MarkVCID1, the 7-center consortium developed a series of biomarkers of which NIH selected 11 for further testing in MarkVCID2. UNM was the leader with UCD for the Free Water MRI kit, which will be biologically validated and studied longitudinally. In MarkVCID2, UNM will continue to validate all of the other MRI biomarkers and to provide data to support all of the fluid biomarkers that are advancing; we will recruit 200 diverse patients over 2 years as well as continue assessments of our MarkVCID1 cohort to include in the study-ready population.",Validation of Biomarkers of Small Vessel Injury in VCID,10369502,UF1NS100598,"[""Alzheimer's

"Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging Project Abstract Motivation: We aim to develop and implement a new approach to transform pediatric MRI. The ultimate goal is ultra-fast and motion-robust imaging in a dedicated child-friendly environment to enable more children undergo MRI without anesthesia. For those who still require anesthesia, it will be briefer and lighter, and performed in a safer environment. This project leverages a small compact magnet, designed for adult brain MRI, with gradients that enable very fast imaging. With this magnet as an outstanding starting point, we will tailor our deep experience and multiple successes in developing new MRI approaches to high-density receiver coils, fast imaging sequences, and new image reconstruction methods to set a new standard for pediatric MRI. Approach: Although the compact scanner is designed for adult heads, with a 37 cm inner diameter, it can accommodate children under eight to ten years of age to image any body part. To transform this system for ideal pediatric scanning, three development aims will be pursued. The ﬁrst is to enable optimal signal reception. This will be accomplished through creating new receive chain electronics that are matched to the gradient capabilities, for ultra-high bandwidth imaging. This will be coupled to very thin and formed receive arrays that maximize the size of the patient that can be accommodated in the small bore of the scanner. The second aim is to develop methods of obtaining the highest performance out of the system by characterizing and correcting for its imperfections. This will be coupled to a bespoke approach to peripheral nerve stimulation, enabling maximal use of the gradients on each patient. These two developments will then be leveraged for high efﬁciency and motion robust noncartesian scanning. The ﬁnal aim is to develop a full environment and infrastructure that is well suited to pediatric imaging. Patient preparation and acclimation to MRI will be enhanced by virtual reality. Support equipment for anesthesia, new physiological sensors, and a novel child-friendly audiovisual system will be created. Signiﬁcance: The result of this project will be a revolutionary change in the way that MRI is used and per- formed for children. MRI will be more available, cheaper, safer, and have markedly improved image quality.

"Next-Generation Cardiovascular MRI powered by Artificial Intelligence Project Summary/Abstract: Despite the accuracy and versatility of cardiovascular MRI, its footprint is only 1% among cardiac imaging tests (SPECT, echocardiography, CT, MRI) in the US. While there are several factors such as referral patterns favoring SPECT and echocardiography among cardiologists that account for low utilization, the two addressable obstacles that preclude widespread adoption are lengthy scan time (imaging facility operational cost) and reading (physician cost). These obstacles must be addressed for community hospitals with limited resources to adopt cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. While compressed sensing (CS), since its introduction into the MRI world in 2007, has led to highly-accelerated cardiovascular MRI acquisitions, the subsequent image reconstruction remains too slow (> 5 min for 2D time series, > 1 hour for 3D time series) for clinical translation (unmet need 1). Downstream, image analysis for cardiovascular MRI is notoriously labor intensive (e.g. 30- to 60-min) and limited (“circles” at two cardiac phases for cine MRI, whereas perfusion and late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) images are evaluated visually), for what is essentially a basic computer vision task (unmet need 2). In direct response, we will address these two unmet needs and unlock the enormous potential of CMR using deep learning (DL). DL applications have exploded since advancements in optimization and GPU hardware. While several recent studies have applied neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), U-Nets, and Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) for reconstruction and segmentation, no study has implemented an inline end-to-end pipeline that receives raw k-space from the MRI scanner and delivers both reconstructed images and fully processed images automatically with high speed (< 1 min). The objectives of this study are: a) developing a network for image reconstruction with maximal acceleration (aim 1), (b) developing a network for image processing tasks (aim 2), and c) developing an integrated, end-to-end network that does both (aim 3). By developing an architecture that can simultaneously learn maximal acceleration, fine tune end-to-end performance, and perform reconstruction/inference using feed-forward networks, we anticipate a disruptive technology that will lead to a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and increase its footprint in community hospitals. This 2-year study is doable because of the requisite database of raw k-space (not derived from DICOM) data (N = 617) and annotated cardiac MR images (N=3,021) from over 3,000 patients existing at our institution. Success of this proposal will deliver a disruptive technology that has potential to cause a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and enable widespread adoption of cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a new-generation cardiovascular MRI technology empowered by artificial intelligence, more specifically deep learning. The proposed technology accurately reconstructs cardiovascular images and segments cardiac regions of interest within 1 min without any human intervention.

"Content-based MR-TRUS Fusion without Tracking There are about 3 million American men living with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. If the prostate cancer is caught early before it spreads to other parts of the body, by active monitoring or treatment, most men will not die from it. Nevertheless, 22% to 47% of the patients with negative biopsies but elevated prostate-specific antigen levels may still harbor malignant tumors, which can be life threatening and could have been missed by the commonly used ultrasound guided random biopsy. By contrast, fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted biopsies has shown to significantly improve the cancer detection rate. However, MR-TRUS fusion itself is very challenging due to the difficulties in directly registering images of these two very different modalities in different dimensions. To bypass the difficult registration problems, the existing fusion techniques require the use of specialized expensive and cumbersome hardware tracking devices, which increases cost and elongates procedures. More importantly, due to a number of factors such as patient movement, respiratory motion and ultrasound transducer pressure change, prostate motion can happen during a procedure and cause the images to be misaligned. Timely noticing and correcting such motion require great skill and knowledge of radiological imaging, where studies show a steep learning curve for mastering fusion systems. Failing in image registration and motion compensation renders the fusion guided biopsy performing no differently than random biopsy. To address the fundamental cause of the problems, the goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR- TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices. The proposed research is foundational for developing next generation of MR-TRUS fusion guidance systems for prostate biopsy to achieve robust performance with lower costs. Recent advancement in machine learning, especially deep learning, has provided us new tools and new angles to tackle this challenging problem. This project aims for directly fusing 2D TRUS frames with 3D MR volume by developing novel deep learning methods for image reconstruction and registration. The proposed methods are designed to exploit both population and patient specific imaging information to accurately align images. As all learning-based image registration methods try to better use population knowledge to improve the registration performance, few of them have been able to efficiently use patient specific information, which can be essential to obtain robust and accurate performance. Upon successful completion, the innovation created from the project will disrupt the common perception that hardware tracking has to be used for multimodal image fusion-guided interventions and alleviate the demand on physicians’ experience and skill in image analysis and fusion to help obtain consistent results. This project will lead to the development of novel prostate biopsy systems and will also impact a range of other image fusion based interventional guidance technologies. Fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted prostate biopsies can significantly improve the detection of aggressive cancer. The goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR-TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices.

"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function.

"Predicting Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Through Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Pre-Diagnostic CT Images The objective of the proposed project is to develop a Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prediction model to identify individuals who have high risk for PDAC in the next 3 years through Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis of pre-diagnostic CT images and non-imaging factors. PDAC is the fourth leading cause of cancer- related deaths in both men and women in the United States despite its low incidence rate. The 5-year survival rate for all stages of PDAC is 10% but can be as high as 50% with early-stage diagnosis. Therefore, identification of individuals at high risk for PDAC has high clinical significance as follow-up imaging examinations or biopsy may assist in early detection and allow surgical intervention while the tumors are still resectable. However, PDAC prediction is difficult due to the lack of reliable screening tools, the absence of sensitive and specific symptoms and biomarkers, and low prevalence.  Abdominal pain is the single most common reason that Americans visit the emergency room (ER), where an abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan is usually performed. Even though most scans don’t show any signs of cancer visible to the naked eyes of radiologists, some subjects eventually develop PDAC in the next few years. These pre-diagnostic CT images provide critical morphological information associated with biological changes at the pre-cancer or early cancer stage, which can be extracted using AI to predict PDAC risk. Therefore, the objective of the proposed project is to uncover unique features in pre-diagnostic images using AI and develop PDAC prediction model based on these features. Non-imaging factors such as demographic, epidemiologic, and anthropometric factors, clinical comorbidities, and laboratory tests will be included in the model to improve the prediction accuracy. The primary hypotheses are a) AI allows extraction of unique image features in pre-diagnostic CT images associated with pre-cancer or early cancer biological changes that are invisible to naked eyes and b) the combination of pre-diagnostic image features and non- imaging factors improves the accuracy of PDAC risk stratification and prediction over that using conventional non-imaging factors alone. To verify these hypotheses, we will retrospectively evaluate CT pancreatic images obtained up to 3 years prior to PDAC diagnosis that were deemed non-cancerous by radiologists. A group of subjects who underwent similar imaging studies for non-gastrointestinal disorders and were age/gender matched with pre-diagnostic imaging will serve as healthy controls. Accurately stratifying high risk individuals may allow for early detection of PDAC in the future. A major challenge of the project is the scarcity of the appropriate imaging data because of the low prevalence of PDAC and stringent enrollment criteria. Eight major medical centers will participate in collection of 1,064 cases. The end point of this project is the development, training, and validation of an AI-based PDAC prediction model, which will identify individuals who are at high risk for developing PDAC within the next 3 years. Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a common type of pancreatic cancer, is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm based on computed- tomography scans to identify individuals at high risk for PDAC, which may allow early detection and increase survival rate.",Predicting Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Through Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Pre-Diagnostic CT Images,10236146,R01CA260955,"['Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Modeling ', ' pancreas imaging ', ' Pancreas Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reader ', ' Resectable ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Validation ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' abdominal CT ', ' abdominal computed tomography ', ' radiomics ', ' risk stratification ', ' stratify risk ', ' imaging study ', ' human error ', ' deep learning ', ' automated segmentation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' large datasets ', ' large data sets ', ' risk prediction ', ' forecasting risk ', ' Abdominal Pain ', ' Accounting ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pancreatic duct ', ' Wirsung canal ', ' Patients ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Training Technics ', ' Training Technique ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Tail of pancreas ', ' Individual ', ' radiologist ', ' ']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,1160586
"Methods and Tools for Integrating Pathomics Data into Cancer Registries The goal of this project is to enrich SEER registry data with high‐quality population‐based biospecimen data in the form of digital pathology, machine learning based classifications and quantitative pathomics feature sets. We will create a well‐curated repository of high‐quality digitized pathology images for subjects whose data is being collected by the registries. These images will be processed to extract computational features and establish deep linkages with registry data, thus enabling the creation of information‐rich, population cohorts containing objective imaging and clinical attributes. Specific examples of digital Pathology derived feature sets include quantification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and segmentation and characterization of cancer or stromal nuclei. Features will also include spectral and spatial signatures of the underlying pathology. The scientific premise for this approach stems from increasing evidence that information extracted from digitized pathology images (pathomic features) are a quantitative surrogate of what is described in a pathology report. The important distinction being that these features are quantitative and reproducible, unlike human observations that are highly qualitative and subject to a high degree of inter‐ and intra‐observer variability. This dataset will provide, a unique, population‐wide tissue based view of cancer, and dramatically accelerate our understanding of the stages of disease progression, cancer outcomes, and predict and assess therapeutic effectiveness.  This work will be carried out in collaboration with three SEER registries. We will partner with The New Jersey State Cancer Registry during the development phase of the project (UG3). During the validation phase of the project (UH3), the Georgia and Kentucky State Cancer Registries will join the project. The infrastructure will be developed in close collaboration with SEER registries to ensure consistency with registry processes, scalability and ability support creation of population cohorts that span multiple registries. We will deploy visual analytic tools to facilitate the creation of population cohorts for epidemiological studies, tools to support visualization of feature clusters and related whole‐slide images while providing advanced algorithms for conducting content based image retrieval. The scientific validation of the proposed environment will be undertaken through three studies in Prostate Cancer, Lymphoma and NSCLC, led by investigators at the three sites. The goal of this project is to enrich SEER cancer registry data with high‐quality population‐based information arising from digitized Pathology slides. Data extracted directly from digitized pathology images (Pathomics data) promise to provide information not consistently available from Pathology reports.

"Non-invasive neurosurgical planning with Random Matrix Theory MRI PROJECT SUMMARY About 23,830 people in the US are diagnosed per year with primary malignant brain tumors, and 200,000- 300,000 with metastatic brain tumors (10-30% of all cancers). Maximizing surgical resection of tumor is a major predictor of survival, but must be balanced against the risk of injuring eloquent white matter and cortical regions. To improve outcomes, the unmet need is to radically increase quality of noninvasive preoperative brain mapping. As the brain mapping gold standard, MRI offers unique soft-tissue contrast, anatomical and functional information of the brain, yet is inherently signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-starved. The majority of brain mapping relies on diffusion (dMRI) and functional (fMRI), which are both especially severely limited by SNR. The MRI signal can be increased with higher-field; however, scanner prices scale with the field strength: 1.5T ~ $1.5M, 7T ~ $7M, as do installation and service costs. Since 90% of the MRIs in the US are 1.5T or below, it appears that the majority of hospitals cannot justify or afford high field MRI. SNR increase by the signal averaging is impractical from the scan time perspective, as brain tumor patients rarely tolerate scan times above 45 min. Our company, Microstructure Imaging (MICSI), is an award-winning New York University (NYU) spinoff that offers a software-as-a-service for medical image processing. Our product dramatically enhances the SNR of MRI brain mapping, which translates into increased resolution, image quality, sensitivity and specificity. Here we employ random matrix theory (RMT) to achieve an order-of-magnitude gain in SNR purely in software at the image reconstruction level, by utilizing the information across multiple radiofrequency coils and MRI contrasts within a single protocol. Our overarching goal is to optimize our RMT/MP-PCA image reconstruction algorithm for the clinical translation in brain mapping preoperative studies. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Enabling lower field / higher resolution. We will develop and evaluate a multimodal (dMRI/fMRI) RMT denoising and reconstruction protocol in 6 volunteers on 1.5T and 3T with different image resolutions, and retrospectively in 30 preoperative brain mapping MRI patients. This data will be used to justify prospectively altering clinical MRI protocols during the anticipated Phase II of the STTR. Aim 2: Clinical feasibility study. 15 minutes of additional scan time for dMRI and 2 fMRI tasks at 1.2 mm isotropic resolution will be prospectively added to 10 brain mapping cases at 3T. The image quality with and without denoising will be assessed quantitatively, and qualitatively by radiologists and neurosurgeons. While the Phase-I STTR will optimize RMT in preoperative planning for brain tumors, in the future we will optimize protocols for any tumor type or location by joint RMT reconstruction of variety of MRI modalities (perfusion, T1/T2, dMRI, fMRI) to help them denoise each other and maximize the overall information content. RMT image reconstruction will open MRI to the developing world by bringing high-field quality to inexpensive low-field MRI. PROJECT NARRATIVE A modern MRI scanner is a multi-million-dollar machine, which has become a clinical gold-standard for non- invasive diagnostics and presurgical planning of brain tumors; however, its overarching technological challenge is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ultimately limiting the image resolution and quality in the clinic. To improve diagnostic image quality and increase the resolution, the SNR must be radically increased, which currently entails spending an additional 1-4 million dollars on higher-field scanners, with incremental outcomes. This proposal demonstrates that our innovative denoising and image reconstruction algorithm, based on random matrix theory and implemented purely in software, increases SNR by an order-of-magnitude in clinically relevant structural and functional MRI acquisitions, matching or exceeding the quality of costly hardware investments, and can greatly improve the quality of non-invasive neurosurgical planning for brain tumors.",Non-invasive neurosurgical planning with Random Matrix Theory MRI,10258848,R41CA257624,"['Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', '

"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10187567,U24EB028936,"['Adoption ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Newsletter ', ' Noise ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Visual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' reconstruction ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' open source ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' clinical practice ', ' Radiation exposure ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2021,310796
"Artificial Intelligence Boosted Evolution and Detection of Genetically Encoded Reporters for In Vivo Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Magnetic resonance (MR) reporter genes have the potential to monitor transgene expression non-invasively in real time at high resolution. These genes can be applied to interrogate the efficacy of gene therapy, to monitor viral therapeutics and viral gene delivery, to assess cellular differentiation, cell trafficking, and specific metabolic activity, and also assess changes in the microenvironment. Efforts toward the development of MR reporter genes have been made for over a decade, but, despite these efforts, the field is still in its early developmental stage. This reflects the fact that there are numerous complications, caused by the low sensitivity of detection, the need for substrates with their associated undesirable pharmacokinetics, and/or the difficult and, in some cases, delayed interpretation of signal changes. We have previously demonstrated that many of these challenges can be overcome with the use of a lysine rich protein (LRP) reporter gene, that is detectable by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI. However, to mature the CEST reporter gene technology and bring it towards clinical translation, its sensitivity and specificity need to be improved. In particular, the LRP reporter gene specificity is limited by the fact that the lysine amide exchangeable protons of LRP have the same chemical shift as amide protons from endogenous proteins. It is therefore difficult to distinguish the reporter CEST contrast from the background CEST contrast, both of which may be changing with time. The specificity is further limited by the sensitivity of the CEST contrast to intracellular pH where the qualitative CEST contrast cannot distinguish between exchange rate and concentration effects. Finally, a decrease in cytosolic pH, observed in many disease pathologies, reduces the amide proton exchange rate and hence the CEST reporter sensitivity. We therefore propose to develop improved MRI reporter genes and quantitative MRI detection methods that will facilitate the clinical translation of these methods for imaging biological therapeutics, such as oncolytic virotherapy. We hypothesize that CEST reporter genes with improved sensitivity and specificity along with improved quantitative CEST methods will enable viral infection and replication to be monitored longitudinally throughout OV tumor therapy. To test this hypothesis and establish the clinical potential of MRI reporter genes we will capitalize on two transformative technologies developed in our labs; (Aim 1) an artificial intelligence based genetic programming algorithm will be used for optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of the CEST reporter gene and (Aim 2) a CEST magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) method will be used for the rapid quantification of both the reporter protein concentration and chemical exchange rate. (Aim 3) These methods will be validated for imaging oncolytic viral infection and replication in mouse glioblastoma tumor models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cell and viral based therapies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of many diseases. However, the optimization of such biological therapies depends critically on the ability to monitor the spread and persistence of the therapeutic agent and assess the tissue response. This project therefore proposes to develop and optimize a novel MRI reporter gene technology that allows for the imaging of biological therapeutics. The reporter gene technology will be demonstrated for monitoring oncolytic virotherapy in glioblastoma tumor models, however, the technology is generalizable to any biological therapeutic.",Artificial Intelligence Boosted Evolution and Detection of Genetically Encoded Reporters for In Vivo Imaging,10180072,R01EB031008,"['Algorithms ', ' Amides ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Fingerprint ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' Goals ', ' Infection ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Lysine ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Oncolytic viruses ', ' Pathology ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Proteins ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus Replication ', ' viral multiplication ', ' viral replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Tumor Cell Line ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Chemicals ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Metabolic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Performance ', ' trafficking ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' rapid method ', ' rapid technique ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Gene Transfer ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Oncolytic ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' cancer imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' viral gene delivery ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' therapeutic gene ', ' gene therapeutics ', ' gene-based therapeutic ', ' gene-based therapeutics ', ' genes therapeutic ', ' genes therapeutics ', ' transgene expression ', ' tumor ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' oncolytic virotherapy ', ' cancer virotherapy ', ' oncolytic viral therapy ', ' oncolytic virus therapy ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' detection sensitivity ', ' detection method ', ' detection procedure ', ' detection technique ', ' ']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,680476
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation.

"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset.

"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,10155483,R01EB009690,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Noise ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Ionizing radiation ', ' Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation-Ionizing Total ', ' ionizing output ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' soft tissue ', ' Body part ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' data quality ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Radiation ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Image Compression ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Pediatric Oncology ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' volunteer ', ' community setting ', ' clinical practice ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' T2 weighted imaging ', ' T2 imaging ', ' T2 weighted image ', ' imaging system ', ' radiation risk ', ' clinical translation ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Injections ', ' Child Health ', ' patient tolerability ', ' patient tolerance ', ' ']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,631942
"System-independent quantitative cardiac  CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Phase II, SBIR Summary BioInVision, Inc. and team - Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) biomedical engineers and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (UH) imaging cardiologists - will develop software for quantitative analysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP) data, creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) function with coronary anatomy from coronary computed to- mography angiography (CCTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CCTP+CCTA combination could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, low flow with- out the presence of a stenosis suggests microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and diabetes patients. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments, and is high throughput as compared to other methods. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, with are unavailable in any other single modality, providing a unique ability to non-invasively discriminate cardiac microvascular disease. It has excellent resolution enabling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With the inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway which has been dominated by SPECT my- ocardial imaging, a modality that gives zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable flow esti- mates. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trustworthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging. With suc- cess, our project could lead to an improved gateway examination that could reduce unnecessary invasive coro- nary angiography, thereby reducing costs, patient discomfort, patient risk, and possibly unnecessary interven- tional therapies.",System-independent quantitative cardiac  CT perfusion,10154267,R44HL156811,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ',

"Nonlinear performance analysis and prediction for robust low dose lung CT 1 PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  2 Nonlinear algorithms such as model-based reconstruction (MBR) and deep learning (DL) reconstruction have  3 sparked tremendous research interest in recent years. Compared to traditional linear approaches, the nonline-  4 arity of these algorithm transcends traditional signal-to-noise requirement and offer flexibility to draw information  5 from a variety of sources (e.g., statistical model, prior image, dictionary, training data). MBR has enabled numer-  6 ous advancements including low-dose CT and advanced scanning protocols. Deep learning algorithms are rap-  7 idly emerging and have demonstrated superior dose vs. image quality tradeoffs in research settings. However,  8 widespread clinical adoption of nonlinear algorithms has been impeded by the lack of a lack of systematic, quan-  9 titative methods for performance analysis. Nonlinear methods come with numerous dependencies on the imag- 10 ing techniques, the imaging target, and the prior information, and the data itself. The relationship between these 11 dependencies and image quality is often opaque. Furthermore, improper selection of algorithmic parameters can 12 lead to erroneous features (e.g., smaller lesions, texture) in the reconstruction. Therefore, methods to quantify 13 and predict performance permit efficient and quantifiable performance evaluation to provide the robust control 14 and understanding of imaging output necessary for reliable clinical application and regulatory oversight. 15 We propose to establish a robust, predictive framework for performance assessment and optimization that can 16 be generalized to any reconstruction method. We quantify performance in turns of the perturbation response and 17 covariance as a function of imaging techniques, system configurations, patient anatomy, and, importantly, the 18 perturbation itself. The perturbation response quantifies the appearance (e.g., biases, blurs, distortions), and, 19 together with the covariance, allows the computation of more complex metrics such as task-based performance 20 and radiomic measures including size, shape, and texture information. We illustrate utility of the approach in lung 21 imaging with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop a lesion library and generate perturbations encom- 22 passing clinically relevant features. We will extract lesions from public databases and develop methods lesion 23 emulation in for realistic CT simulation and physical data via 3D printing technology. Aim 2: Develop a gener- 24 alized prediction framework for perturbation response and covariance. Using analytical and neural network 25 modeling, we will establish a framework that predicts perturbation response and covariance across imaging 26 scenarios for classes of algorithms with increasing data-dependence including MBR with a Huber penalty, MBR 27 with dictionary regularization, and a deep learning reconstructor. Aim 3: Develop assessment and optimiza- 28 tion strategies to drive robust, low dose lung screening CT methods. We will optimize and adapt nonlinear 29 algorithms and protocols for lung cancer screening to achieve faithful representations of clinical features. This 30 work has the potential to drive much-needed quantitative assessment standards that directly relate image quality 31 to diagnostic performance and optimal strategies for robust, reliable clinical deployment of nonlinear algorithms. 32 PROJECT NARRATIVE Major research efforts have been devoted to the development of nonlinear reconstruction algorithms – from model-based reconstruction to deep learning, these algorithms have demonstrated many advantages such as improved image quality, reduced radiation dose, and additional diagnostic information that are not achievable with traditional linear reconstructions. However, only a disproportionately small number has reach the clinic due to the lack of a predictive image quality analysis framework to quantify diagnostic performance, control algorithm behavior, and ensure consistent performance for robust clinical deployment. The propose effort use a combination of analytic and machine learning approaches to drive much-needed quantitative assessment standards that directly relate image quality to diagnostic performance and establish optimal strategies for robust, reliable clinical deployment of nonlinear algorithms.",Nonlinear performance analysis and prediction for robust low dose lung CT,10121056,R01CA249538,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Beauty ', ' Behavior ', ' Dictionary ', ' Genes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Nodule ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Lung nodule ', ' pulmonary nodule ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Clinical ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' Shapes ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' exhaustion ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Transcend ', ' interest ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Electronic library ', ' Digital Libraries ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' shape analysis ', ' shape description ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' 3D Print ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' Lung CAT Scan ', ' CT Lung Screening ', ' Lung CT ', ' Lung CT scan ', ' computerized tomography lung screening ', ' lung computerized axial tomography scan ', ' lung computerized tomography ', ' lung computerized tomography scan ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' targeted imaging ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' predicting response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' radiomics ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' low dose computed tomography ', ' low dose computerized tomography ', ' low-dose CT ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,512567
"Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam Abstract Non-invasive, multi-parametric characterization of prostate cancer (PC), with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, is an active area of research with great potential for providing improved diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The PI-RADSv2 assessment system that was established by an international team of experts recognizes the value of quantitative images in PC diagnosis, but relies largely on qualitative evaluation of weighted images. Although this grading approach achieves reasonably good separation be- tween normal and abnormal prostate tissue, it does not achieve adequate separation between indolent and aggressive disease, with the risk that more unnecessary and costly surgery is performed with poten- tially dire consequences on patient quality of life. High-value protocols, without need for an invasive and costly endo-rectal radio-frequency coil are being investigated. This comes at the cost of extended scan time and reduced image quality in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and signal bias, which negatively impacts sensitivity and speciﬁcity of multi-parametric MRI. With the pronounced increase of multi-parametric MRI exams, there is also the desire to integrate the support by the most recent revolution in diagnostic imaging, i.e., machine learning. It becomes increasingly clear, that in order to avoid having to train neural networks for each speciﬁc system and protocol, reproducible and thus preferably quantitative imaging protocols are essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose both pulse sequence develop- ment, investigation of ADC validity and reproducibility and novel post-processing strategies. The overall objective is to demonstrate the added value of lesion characterization with quantitative values and at the same time understand and minimize the inﬂuence of protocol choices and scan hardware, hence improve overall reproducibility. Speciﬁc Aim 1 will focus on the development of a low distortion MR imaging sequence for rapid concurrent quantiﬁcation of T2 and diﬀusion signal decay. Speciﬁc Aim 2 will examine ADC variations that result from changes in diﬀusion time over a range that is typical with present day clinical MR systems. Speciﬁc Aim 3 introduces advanced handling of low noise diﬀusion data, which will be indispensable for achieving high accuracy and precision with non-invasive and economic external coils. Speciﬁc Aim 4 introduces a novel ADC computation approach that fully captures the complex diﬀusion signal decays in tissues and at the same time is largely protocol and system independent. Moreover, re- sulting images and quantitative maps processed according this approach, exhibit considerably lower noise, which can be traded for higher spatial resolution or shorter scan duration. In combination, the consis- tently quantitative nature of the data and its ubiquitous validity and comparability will greatly facilitate the establishment of recommendations for disease-related thresholds. Ultimately this may permit much more reliable diﬀerentiation of aggressive from indolent disease. Project Narrative Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role for staging of prostate cancer. We propose advances that permit quantitative and a more reliable assessment of prostate cancer. Potentially this will permit better diﬀerentiation of disease that is aggressive from disease that poses low risk of spreading.",Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam,10115670,R01CA241817,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biopsy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Joints ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Tweens ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' rectal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Indolent ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' magnetic field ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Consequentialism ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' novel strategies ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' radio frequency ', ' radiofrequency ', ' contrast imaging ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,452748
"OCT and OCTA image processing for retinal assessment of people with MS Project Summary/Abstract (Max 30 lines of text) Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS), it has been challenging to acquire consistent MRI measurements of MS disease burden. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retina has emerged as a complementary source of imaging biomarkers, wherein retinal thickness measurements have been shown to correlate well with MS disease burden. As well, OCT angiography (OCTA)—a new imaging modality acquired with the same OCT scanner—yields multiple new biomarkers among which macular vessel density has been shown to correlate with MS disability. There is strong evidence that OCT and OCTA may provide much needed imaging biomarkers for MS, but there are remaining technical challenges to overcome. Many algorithms for computation of retinal layer thicknesses from OCT images have been developed, but measurement of longitudinal changes in individual MS subjects remains highly challenging, especially in MS where yearly changes are small relative to intrinsic measurement variations. We propose a novel iterative registration and deep learning segmentation algorithm for longitudinal OCT retinal image segmentation. Development of automatic algorithms for analysis of OCTA images is in an early stage and there are opportunities for significant improvements. We will develop a deep network for OCTA vessel segmentation and biomarker computation that both suppresses artifacts that are common in OCTA and provides consistent results across different scanners. As both OCT and OCTA become more widely used in the characterization and management of MS, it is becoming increasingly important to jointly characterize these biomarkers and relate them to disease status, which is currently characterized largely by clinical evaluations. We will address the central question of whether OCT and OCTA can be used to predict disease progression by developing a new disease progression score for MS based on multiple OCT and OCTA measurements as well as clinical and MRI biomarkers, acquired in both single and multiple imaging visits. The proposed research will: 1) Develop a fast, topologically-correct longitudinal segmentation method for the macula; 2) Develop a method for artifact-suppressed and consistent computation of OCTA features in the macula; 3) Develop a disease progression score to jointly characterize longitudinal retinal OCT and OCTA measurements in MS; and 4) Carry out longitudinal studies of healthy controls and people with MS using OCT and OCTA measurements. We will assess whether average features within the macula or features averaged over smaller segments yield better estimates of progression. We will also assess whether OCT alone or OCT together with OCTA provide better estimates of progression. Image processing and disease progression algorithms will be made freely available to the research community. The proposed research will greatly advance the use of OCT and OCTA in characterizing longitudinal changes in the retina, potentially leading to standard eye measurements for monitoring and managing MS and other neurological and eye diseases. Project Narrative Monitoring the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been challenging due to the inconsistency and variability of both clinical and magnetic resonance imaging assessments. This project will develop methods and software for analysis of both optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) scans of the retina, both of which show correlation to disability in MS. At the conclusion of the grant, software implementing the methods will be made available to the research community in a highly portable computer language.",OCT and OCTA image processing for retinal

"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",10129958,R01EB028591,"['Affect ', ' Alkalies ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Calcium Oxalate ', ' calcium salt Ethanedioic acid ', ' calcium phosphate ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Kidney Calculi ', ' Kidney Stones ', ' Renal Calculi ', ' Renal Stone ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minerals ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' United States ', ' Uric Acid ', ' Trioxopurine ', ' Urinary Calculi ', ' Urinary Stones ', ' Urinary Tract Stones ', ' Urolith ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Research Subjects ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Ureteroscopy ', ' Surface ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Recovery ', ' Bilateral ', ' Measurement ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' attenuation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Cost Efficient Management ', ' Cost Effective Management ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' risk minimization ', ' clinical investigation ', ' photon-counting detector ', ' photon detection ', ' single photon detector ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' health management ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' deep learning ', ' statistical learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,350335
