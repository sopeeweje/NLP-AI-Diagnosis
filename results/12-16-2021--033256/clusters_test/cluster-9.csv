"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10136739,R44TR003254,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Belief ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hospital Administration ', ' Hospital Management ', ' Language ', ' language training ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Operations Research ', ' Patients ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Licensing ', ' Active Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' System ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Translational Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' active method ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' rapid growth ', ' next generation ', ' interoperability ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' commercialization ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' cloud based ', ' model building ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Natural Language Processing pipeline ', ' NLP pipeline ', ' clinical database ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' ']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2021,463975
"Automated Presurgical Language Mapping via Deep Learning for Multimodal Brain Connectivity Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with a primary brain tumor each year. Neu- rosurgery remains the ﬁrst and most common therapeutic option for these patients with outcomes linked to the extent of tumor resection. However, larger resections also increase the risk for postoperative deﬁcits, particularly in the motor and language areas of the eloquent cortex. Task fMRI (t-fMRI) has emerged as a powerful nonin- vasive tool for preoperative mapping, but these acquisitions are lengthy and cognitively demanding for patients. Moreover, t-fMRI is unreliable if the patient cannot perform the tasks while in the scanner. Our long-term goal is to develop an automated platform for reliable eloquent cortex mapping across a broad patient cohort that comple- ments the existing clinical workﬂow. The overall objective of this proposal is to design and validate new machine learning algorithms that leverage the complementary strengths of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (d-MRI), which are both passive modalities and easy to acquire. Our central hypothesis is that the combined structural-functional connectivity information in these modalities will enable us to localize language functionality in patients with brain tumors. Our innovative strategy uses recent advancements in deep learning to capture com- plex interactions in the rs-fMRI and d-MRI data that collectively deﬁne the language areas. We will evaluate our hypothesis via two speciﬁc aims. In Aim 1 we will develop a graph neural network (GNN) that employs specialized convolutional ﬁlters to capture topological properties of the connectivity data across multiple scales. Our GNN will be trained in a supervised fashion and evaluated against t-fMRI activations and intraoperative electrocortical stimulation. In Aim 2 we will conduct an exploratory analysis to retrospectively link our GNN predictions to post- operative changes in language functionality. Namely, we hypothesize that patients for whom the surgical path intersects our GNN predictions will experience greater deﬁcits across ﬁne-grained language subdomains. We will also assess the prognostic value of our GNN predictions, as compared to other clinical factors. We anticipate the proposed research will have a transformative impact on surgical planning by helping neurosurgeons to plan more targeted and safer surgeries, thus improving patient outcomes and overall quality of care. Project Narrative The proposed research addresses a critical and unmet public health need in managing primary brain tumors by improving the accuracy of eloquent cortex mapping during preoperative planning. The algorithms developed through these efforts will help to streamline the surgical procedures and mitigate the risk for postoperative deﬁcits, towards the ultimate goal of improving both quality of care and long-term clinical outcomes.",Automated Presurgical Language Mapping via Deep Learning for Multimodal Brain Connectivity,10286181,R21CA263804,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Equipment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hospitals ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Sleep ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modality ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Primary Brain Tumors ', ' Primary Brain Neoplasms ', ' Property ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' independent component analysis ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Network-based ', ' tumor ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' patient population ', ' common treatment ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' cortical mapping ', ' care costs ', ' preservation ', ' Grain ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' multilayer perceptron ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,221368
"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy in a double-blinded study of 75 subjects with chronic aphasia.

"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia.

"Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques Project Summary/Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting over eight million Americans, of whom 100,000 a year suffer major amputation. Current guidelines dictate medical treatment and aggressive risk factor modification for all PAD patients, whether symptomatic or not, with revascularization attempts for patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) or lifestyle-limiting claudication. Despite strongly-worded standards of care, variability in PAD outcomes persists. Prior research has demonstrated that some demographic factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status are associated with worse PAD care and outcomes even when controlling for comorbidities. It is unknown what specific patient, provider, and healthcare system factors lead to these disparities. Efforts to understand which patients will suffer worse outcomes and disease progression have been hampered by contemporary outcomes research techniques. The majority of PAD outcomes research relies on administrative claims databases, procedural registries, or single center retrospective reviews. While each of these methods has some advantages, none offer the combination of patient- and disease-specific data, information about care provision on a provider and health-system level, and outcomes across a range of possible locations. Furthermore, use of any of these methods at the scale necessary to draw powerful conclusions is prohibitively time- and resource-intensive. The overall objective of this research is to use a novel natural language processing model to build a combined EHR/CMS database and to use that database to predict which PAD patients are at highest risk of poor outcomes with improved power and precision. This proposal contains plans for collaboration with Duke Forge, who bring expertise in natural language processing and machine learning in order to efficiently identify PAD patients within our EHR and efficiently abstract information about them. Once identified, these patients can be linked to their CMS outcomes, allowing for assessment of how patient-, physician-, and healthcare-specific factors affect PAD outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that natural language processing powered by machine learning will permit efficient identification of patients with PAD, thereby facilitating higher-powered and higher-quality investigation into disparities in PAD outcomes. This research will pave the way for future interventions targeting sources of outcome inequality, possibly including access to care, physician adherence to national guidelines, and patient preferences or health literacy. Project Narrative: Peripheral arterial disease affects more than eight million Americans, with over one hundred thousand amputations performed yearly. Despite the prevalence and morbidity of this disease, there is a lack of knowledge about which patients will require amputation, multiple surgeries or hospitalizations, or suffer cardiovascular- related death. This proposal uses natural language processing to improve on current research methodology in order to account for patient-specific, physician-specific, and system-specific factors in peripheral arterial disease care and outcomes.",Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques,10464976,F32HL151181,"['Affect ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Databases ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Inequality ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' ICD-10 ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' Provider ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' claudication ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment effect ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' care outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' provider adherence ', ' adherence by clinicians ', ' adherence by providers ', ' clinician adherence ', ' clinician compliance ', ' physician adherence ', ' physician compliance ', ' provider compliance ', ' ']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,85488
"CRCNS: Discovering Computational Principles of Language Processing in the Brain A critical characteristic of human language is our ability to understand multi-word sequences whose meaning is greater than the sum of their parts. Recent work from the PIs of this proposal (Toneva and Wehbe, 2019; Jain and Huth, 2018) and others (Schrimpf et al., 2020a; Caucheteux & King, 2020) has shown that cortical representations of multi-word sequences can be modeled much more accurately than before by using neural network language models, a machine learning technique that has revolutionized the natural language processing (NLP) field (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019). However, under the current paradigm these models must first be trained on separate NLP tasks and only then used to model the brain, creating a guess-and-check cycle that is not guaranteed to converge on the actual computations that humans perform. Here we propose to break this cycle by directly training neural network models to estimate the functions that the brain uses to combine words. To be able to optimally predict fMRI and MEG responses, these models will need to capture the composition principles governing which words the brain attends to, and how information is combined across words. These models will help uncover specific computations underlying language processing in the brain, enable computational testing of neurolinguistic theories, and inspire or directly improve models used in NLP.  Accomplishing these goals, however, will require overcoming one major obstacle. Training neural net- work language models typically requires orders of magnitude more data than existing neuroimaging datasets. To address this issue, one central goal of this proposed project is to collect a very large fMRI and MEG dataset comprising roughly one million words of natural language stimuli. We plan to use the unique dataset and computational modeling framework to address three scientific aims. Aim 1: Create brain activity prediction benchmarks to foster interaction between neuroscience and NLP. Aim 2: Use data-driven models to test existing neurolinguistic theories & develop new accounts of the computations underlying word composition in the brain. Aim 3: Leverage information in different brain areas to help solve computationally defined language tasks.  Successful completion of the proposed work will provide mechanistic insight into language processing, with a computational architecture tracing information flow among brain areas and describing the tasks they perform. Beyond its basic cognitive neuroscience implications, we expect this work will enable better understanding of language impairments and help identify targeted therapies. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Through collecting, analyzing, and disseminating large-scale neuroimaging datasets collected while participants listen to natural, narrative speech, this proposal aims to improve our understanding of the normal function of the language system. Specifically, this work seeks to improve and validate computational models of speech language processing in the human brain.

"Hippocampal-cortical networks underlying memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge ABSTRACT Language and memory overlap heavily in brain circuitry and in our day-to-day lives. Both are also frequently disrupted in neurological conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. We have a limited understanding of the mechanisms by which cortical language centers integrate with memory circuits; for example, to support the retrieval of linguistic knowledge. This limits our insight into disease pathophysiology and slows the development of more effective therapies for cognitive impairments. This K23 will support an investigation of how language and memory integrate in the human brain, by harnessing unique innovations and resources. First, we will use special high-density grid and depth electrodes to record from many hundreds of local neuronal populations distributed throughout memory and language centers, among patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for refractory epilepsy. Second, to target distinct moments of linguistic-mnemonic integration, we have customized an auditory naming behavioral task that combines controlled yet natural language stimuli with memory retrieval of linguistic knowledge. Third, I will apply state-of-the-art analyses with pattern classifiers and computational linguistics, an approach that could improve the framework of how we understand neural representations of deep language processing. I will first evaluate whether the activity patterns in cortical language centers and the hippocampus reveal neural signatures of dynamic integration during knowledge retrieval, and whether their activity patterns reflect mutual information sufficient to predict the linguistic content of task trials (Aim 1). I will then use electrical stimulation to selectively disrupt neural processing in these regions, to determine if and how they contribute to distinct stages of language and memory integration (Aim 2). This approach will also allow us to probe whether the hippocampus is required for semantic memory, a long-debated question arising from classic literature. My mentorship team has a constellation of expertise aligning with my training plan and the goals of this investigation, including cortical language neurophysiology, hippocampal memory neurophysiology, and investigative neurostimulation. This proposal builds upon my prior expertise in translational intracranial recordings and neural signal processing, and my long-term career goal of understanding and improving treatments for cognitive impairments in epilepsy. I will receive training, coursework, and direct mentorship in skillsets that I will continue to use throughout my scientific career, including language and memory neurophysiology, human neurostimulation, neuroethics, machine learning, computational linguistics, scientific communication, and independent laboratory management. The knowledge and training acquired during this award period will allow me to establish an independent laboratory and emerge as a leader in human intracranial neurophysiology, applying my expertise to unmet needs in epilepsy. NARRATIVE Memory and language functions can be devastatingly impaired by neurological diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. This investigation seeks to understand how the neural circuits that underlie these functions work together to retrieve knowledge from memory, a precious human ability used in our day-to- day lives.

"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment.

"Exploring the brain basis of rhythm in individuals with aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this proposal is to characterize the neural substrates underlying rhythm abilities and the relationship with language profiles in individuals with aphasia. Aphasia is an acquired communication disorder resulting from damage to language regions of the brain, with stroke as the leading cause. Currently, over 2 million individuals in the United States are living with aphasia. Aphasia is notoriously difficult to treat and patients exhibit significant individual variability in recovery trajectories and in what therapeutic elements work best in aiding such recovery. Speech-language pathologists frequently use rhythmic elements (e.g., tapping to a beat) in the clinic in order to facilitate speech output. However, there is a lack of a deep and systematic empirical assessment of rhythm in aphasia at both a behavioral and neural level. Our first aim is to characterize the neural basis of individual differences in rhythm abilities in individuals with chronic, post-stroke aphasia. To do this, we will administer a comprehensive battery of rhythm perception and production tasks to a large cohort of individuals with aphasia and age-matched controls. We will then employ multivariate lesion-symptom mapping, a machine-learning methodology for identifying brain-behavior relationships, to determine which brain regions are associated with rhythm processing in aphasia. We hypothesize that individuals who have damage to brain regions important for rhythm, including the basal ganglia or the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), will exhibit the greatest impairments in rhythm. Critically, the LIFG is a core language region typically damaged in post-stroke, non-fluent aphasia. Motivated by robust evidence for associations between rhythm and language across cognitive, neural, and behavioral domains, we will assess the relationship between rhythm and language measures in aphasia in our second aim. We predict that individuals with higher rhythm abilities will have higher language scores, particularly on measures of connected speech. This mentored training award will provide the applicant with training in advanced neural and behavioral data analysis techniques and expertise in large-scale project management with a patient cohort. With significant and timely clinical relevance, our proposal will address vital gaps in the literature by taking an individual differences approach to understanding the relationship between rhythm, the brain, and language in aphasia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rhythmic elements (e.g., tapping to a beat) are used frequently by speech-language pathologists to facilitate speech output in individuals with aphasia, despite very little empirical and mechanistic groundwork in this area.

"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum ABSTRACT  The parent R01 project is a longitudinal study examining risk and protective factors in the schizophrenia (SZ) spectrum—from healthy controls (HCs) to individuals with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) to recent-onset SZ patients (80 per group)—using MRI and neurocognitive approaches. It tests a neurobiological model which posits that individuals with SPD—an intermediate phenotype—have protective factors against developing threshold psychosis, such as preservation of frontal lobe and less severe temporal lobe abnormalities compared to SZ that lead to milder cognitive and social impairments. Examining natural language processing (NLP) as proposed in this supplement is in line with the scope and aims of the parent R01 project and may inform the key neurobiological model being tested. Moreover, examining NLP using novel measures of semantics and syntax in association with measures from the parent R01 of frontal and temporal white matter integrity/connectivity assessed with diffusion tensor imaging and cognitive domains such as processing speed and working memory is innovative.  Speech and language provide a rich source of data on human thought, including semantic and emotional content, semantic coherence (i.e. flow of meaning), and syntactic structure and complexity (i.e. usage of parts of speech). There is a critical gap in our understanding of the linguistic mechanisms that underlie thought disorder in SZ spectrum. The use of automated linguistic analytic methods has been limited to only a few studies focused on discriminating SZ patients from HCs and predicting psychosis.  Together with our colleagues with expertise in NLP at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, we will use advanced computational speech analytic approaches to identify the linguistic basis of language production along a spectrum from normal to thought disordered. We will use optimal interviewing techniques1 to obtain open-ended 30-45 minute narratives from the large (N = 240) English-speaking sample in the parent R01 study, with a range of language disturbances across the spectrum ranging from none/subtle to severe. NLP techniques including Latent Semantic Analysis2 (LSA) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging3,4 will be conducted using artificial intelligence to examine semantic and syntactic language features to include in our overall neurobiological model. These analyses yield fine-grained indices of speech and language that may more accurately capture thought disorder.  Three specific aims will assess (1) semantic coherence in language production using LSA2 and examine its association with positive symptoms and functional impairment across the spectrum; (2) syntactic complexity in language production using POS tagging3,4 and measure acoustic features to examine their association with negative symptoms and functional impairment; and (3) the relationship between language and speech features (semantic, syntactic, and acoustic) with putative white matter integrity assessed using diffusion tensor imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Speech and language provide a rich source of data on human thought, including semantic and emotional content, semantic coherence (i.e. flow of meaning), and syntactic structure and complexity (i.e. usage of parts of speech). This supplement is in line with the scope and aims of the parent R01 study and in collaboration with our colleagues with expertise in natural language processing at ISMMS, we will: (a) leverage the parent R01—a study of risk and protective factors in the schizophrenia (SZ) spectrum using MRI and neurocognitive measures in healthy controls, individuals with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), and SZ patients (80 per group); and (b) use advanced computational speech analytic approaches to identify the linguistic basis– semantics and syntax–that underlies language production along a spectrum from normal to gradations of thought disorder across the SZ spectrum. No study has rigorously examined this in individuals with SPD as proposed in this application.",Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum,10381940,R01MH121411,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Schizotypal Personality Disorder ', ' schizotypal ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Semantics ', ' Social Adjustment ', ' social adaptation ', ' Speech ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Anisotropy ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' analytical method ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Metaphor ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Inferior ', ' processing speed ', ' Performance ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social cognition ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' Cognitive ', ' functional outcomes ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent response ', ' BOLD response ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' longitudinal course ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' preservation ', ' protective factors ', ' Grain ', ' Psychoses ', ' schizophrenia-spectrum disorder ', ' schizophrenia-spectrum ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,206753
"AI/ML-Readiness for Neuroimaging of Language Project Summary/Abstract Conceptual or semantic knowledge refers to information about objects, actions, relations, self, culture, and includes meanings of words and phrases. The use of this knowledge is pervasive and automatic in daily life. Everyday activities such as communication, recognition and use of objects, social interactions, and decision making are crucially reliant on conceptual knowledge. Impairment of this complex and widely distributed system has serious consequences for quality of life. Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are associated with the impairment of this system, including stroke with aphasia, dementias, temporal lobe epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. Understanding the structure and organization of this system, and the specific ways it is disrupted in these individuals, is critical for developing better treatments and rehabilitation strategies. The goal of this research is to understand the structure and use of this information, its neural basis, and the ways in which it can be impaired by neuropathology. This project pertains to three neuroimaging datasets — two functional MRI and one from stroke survivors — that speak to the neural basis of concepts and language processing in the brain. We aim to transform these data and associated metadata to a “machine learning ready” format and make them easily accessible. This will enable application of powerful modern machine learning techniques, such as Deep Learning, for their analysis. We expect that these analyses will shed new light on the organization and function of this core semantic region in the healthy and impaired brain. Project Narrative Understanding how conceptual information is organized, represented in the brain, and affected by neuropathology is a major focus of research, as it has direct relevance to many neurological disorders. This supplement aims to make data from three neuroimaging datasets relating to conceptual processing “machine learning ready.” We expect that application of Deep Learning to these rich datasets will result in substantial new insights into the neural basis of language, and be valuable for understanding and treating language disorders.",AI/ML-Readiness for Neuroimaging of Language,10412576,R01DC017162,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Distributed Systems ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Noise ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Psycholinguistics ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Semantics ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' angular gyrus ', ' Structure of middle temporal gyrus ', ' Middle Temporal Gyrus ', ' Anterior ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Semantic memory ', ' Inferior ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' phrases ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Property ', ' social cognition ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' neuropathology ', ' Complex Extracts ', ' Crude Extracts ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Impairment ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' parent grant ', ' treatment strategy ', ' language comprehension ', ' comprehending language ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' open data ', ' open science ', ' open-source data ', ' stroke survivor ', ' FAIR principles ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR guiding principles ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' deep learning ', ' feature selection ', ' support vector machine ', ' machine learning method ', ' machine learning methodologies ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2021,287390
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,10105196,R01DC016273,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' youngster ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Infant ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Parents ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Standardization ', ' Syndrome ', ' Time ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Impairment ', ' brain behavior ', ' language processing ', ' translational approach ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard measure ', ' Biological Markers ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' model building ', ' language impairment ', ' recruit ', ' individual variation ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,653332
